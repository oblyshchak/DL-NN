INTRODUCTION. 

Writing history is a serious undertaking, and not to be thought of with- 
out long preparation and minute and scrupulous investigation. If a person 
qualified for the task should devote ten or fifteen years exclusively to it he 
might produce a work that would deserve to stand for the West as Parkman 
stands for the East. What follows, therefore, does not partake of the dignity 
of history. It is merely an outline of events and conditions prominent in 
the past of British Columbia from the very outset. Lack of time, if there 
were no other considerations, would have prevented me from going so deeply, 
and in detail, into the circumstances connected with the history of the 
province as would have been desirable for the purpose and otherwise have 
been possible. As it is, with the assistance of friends, I have been enabled to 
present to the reader a certain chain of facts which have never before been 
presented in the same connected form. These have been grouped so as to 
leave a more distinct impression of their order .and importance. 

There is not much that is new to the student, except, perliaps, the arrange- 
ment. Regarding a country about which so much has been written in a 
desultor}^ way, it is difficult to more than collate and summarize, without, as 
I have intimated, delving for years among the original sources oi our in- 
formation. Hubert Howe Bancroft's History of British Columbia, though 
characterized by many imperfections, performed a splendid service, and indi- 
cated by innumerable references much that will be exceedingly useful for the 
real historian when he appears upon the scene. With a wealth of original 
material at his disposal, however, his own use and treatment of it were not 
historical in that sense in which the great Bancroft excelled. The late 
Alexander Begg, with his conspicuous industry, compiled a history of this

province that is valuable in many respects, but obviously lacking in workman- 
ship, analytical skill and insight. 

To avoid comparisons, I make no pretensions to have done more than 
is set out in the foregoing, and that, I am^ avi^are, imperfectly. It is simply 
a narrative, or succession of narratives, that a journalist familiar with an out- 
line of the events described, niight have contributed to a magazine in order 
to convey a general impression of the past, and prepare the reader for a 
keener appreciation of a more pretentious work with the details faithfully 
and artistically filled in.

CHAPTER I. 
EARLY EXPLORATIONS. 

The study of the history of the Northwest Coast of North America 
carries us back to that period of grand achievement, the sixteenth century. 
It was in this brilHant age of new birth and vigorous thought, when as yet 
the old had not entirely succumbed to the new, nor the new completely sup- 
planted the old, that the Pacific Ocean was discovered. The finding of a 
new ocean highway marked an epoch in the history of the world and it had 
an important bearing on the future relations of the great nations, as well as 
giving new possibilities to the continent of which it formed the western 
boundary. 

Hereafter we witness the Spanish, the Dutch and the English vying 
with each other for the possession of the trade routes to India and the Orient, 
and as an outcome of this rivalry we see the gradual decline of the first and 
the steady rise of the second two as naval powers. 

In all cases where nations have attained world-wide supremacy, we find 
that that supremacy has rested upon the sure foundation of naval superiority 
and command of the sea. Spain was no exception to the rule. The suc- 
cesses of the Spaniards were entirely due to their unrivalled maritime re- 
sources. The development of her navy was so rapid and her rise so remark- 
able that within the short space of three-quarters of the sixteenth century 
she had in its last decade reached the zenith of her fame. But the sun of 
Spain's prosperity waned, even as it had risen, and the dying years of the 
sixteenth century marked the beginning of the decline of Spain's sea-power.

and fore-shadowed the passing of the naval supremacy of the world to the 
Dutch and the English. 

The shouts of acclaim that greeted the tidings of Balboa's achievements 
in viewing the Pacific Ocean from^ the heights of Panama had scarcely died 
away when the house of Castile turned its attentioo to the examination of 
the coasts of America to the north and to the south O'f the Isthmus of Darien, 
hoping to find a passage directly leading tO' the Pacific Ocean. Many expe- 
ditions were despatched with this object in view, and for seven years the 
Spaniards persisted in a futile search for the hidden strait. Then Magellan, 
the Portuguese, with his compatriot Ruy Faleiro, offered to find for Spain a 
western passage to the Moluccas, and Charles V was prevailed upon to fit 
out an expedition of five vessels for this purpose. In 1520, Magellan, after 
mutinies, the loss of several ships and many stirring adventures, discovered 
and sailed through the strait which bears the great navigator's name. The 
Spaniards had at last found the long sought for opening, but the discovery 
after all brought little advantage, the strait being too far south to be used as 
a regular route to the Spice Islands and the Orient. Therefore, it early be- 
came the practice to transfer the gold, silver and precious stones captured in 
Peru, and the rich cargoes of the Philippine argosies, across the Isthmus of 
Darien to the galleons on the eastern coast of this narrow neck of land. The 
South seas were not yet destined to become the scene of commercial activity. 

However, obstacles presented by nature could not long prevail against 
the intrepid and resourceful mariners of Spain in the day of her greatness, 
Cortez, the famous or infamous, according to tlie canons by which he may 
be judged, conquered Mexico and ruthlessly placed a new dominion under 
the galling yoke of the Spaniard. Pizarro, with equal daring and equal 
deviltry-, dethroned the Incas of Peru and forced upon their unfortunate sub- 
jects a tyranny so atrocious that we pale as we read the story of Spanish 
prowess in this unhappy land. These events were fraught with far-reaching 
consequences. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 3 

While the conquest and subsequent pillaging of Mexico and Peru en- 
grossed the attention of Cortez and Pizarro, hardy mariners were exploring 
that portion of the Pacific which washes the coasts of Central America and 
the northern portion of the southern continent. Gradually knowledge of the 
trend of the land was acquired and the possibilities of establishing a short 
route to the far east, by way of the isthmus of Panama, were recognized at 
an early date. Then, Cortez, with the remarkable energy that characterized 
all his actions, pushed his exploration and conquests to the western confines 
of his province, and established the sovereignty of Spain over the whole land, 
from the Gulf to the Pacific. His attempts to colonize the Californian lit- 
toral were failures. The hostility of the inhabitants, the ravages of disease, 
and the barrenness of the soil, proved insurmountable barriers, and rendered 
abortive his ambitious scheming in this direction. In spite, however, of dis- 
asters, Cortez, with indomitable courage and zeal, undertook the exploration 
of the Pacific Coast of North America. He issued instructions for the build- 
ing of ships on the Pacific seaboard, and the difficulties to be overcome may 
well be imagined when it is remembered that all the iron and much other 
material needed for the vessels had to be carried overland to the port of con- 
struction. But even then the difficulties had only commenced, for there was 
no seasoned timber available, and skilled labor was scarce, but in the face of 
all these drawbacks, several vessels were launched from the crude ship yards 
at Tehauntepec. One of these, under the command of Maldonado, sailed 
northward and explored the coast for a distance of some three hundred miles, 
but the data obtained on this voyage was of no particular value. It is inter- 
esting only as marking the first attempt of the Spaniards to explore the un- 
known western coastline of Mexico. In the following years several impor- 
tant expeditions were despatched to the Gulf of California and its shores 
were more or less carefully examined. Of the early voyages along the 
western coast of Mexico that undertaken in 1532 by Diego Hurtado de 
Mendoza, a kinsman of Cortez, was relatively speaking of some consequence. 



4 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mendoza reached a point near the twenty-seventh parallel, where, owing to 
the mutinous conduct of his men, he was forced to send back one of his ves- 
sels, continuing the voyage in the other. It is impossible to say how far this 
pioneer navigator proceeded after parting company with his former com- 
panions, nor have we any record of his observations bearing on the lands 
which he visited in the course of his wanderings, for his vessel was cast away 
on an unknown reef, and neither Mendoza or any O'f his men returned to 
Mexico to recount their adventures. 

As the coast line became better known, as the result of these voyages, 
the explorers became bolder, and at last in 1539, Ulloa, after having exam- 
ined with care the shores of the Vermilion Sea, .as the Gulf of California was 
marked on early charts, rounded the Cape San Lucas, at the southern ex- 
tremity oi the California Peninsula, and pointed the way to the great north- 
west coast that stretched in one long, irregular line tO' the mist-enshrouded 
waters of Behring Strait, although for many a long year it remained, as here- 
tofore, a terra incognita, and nothing foreign disturbed the primeval solitude 
of that vast region. From the time of Ulloa, the first European tO' examine 
tlie outer shore of the California Peninsula, the Spaniards made spasmodic 
efforts to explore and annex the northwest coast, but the endeavors to a 
great extent were rendered fruitless, chiefly owing toi the parsimonious policy 
pursued by the viceroys of Mexico. Nevertheless, whatever may be said with 
regard to the lack of energy displayed by those responsible for the despatch- 
ing of exploratory expeditions, we can, as a general rule, only praise the 
commanders and crews of the vessels to whom this difficult task was entrusted. 
In ships ill-found and small they bravely sailed away to the unknown north- 
ern waters, a few of them to hand their names down to posterity, many of 
them to perish at the hands of savages, or to die miserably from disease, and 
all of them to suffer untold hardships from starvation, sickness, and inclement 
weather on the rock-bound coasts they essayed to explore. 

In 1542 Cabrillo, a navigator of some local fame, followed in UUoa's 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 5 

track, and, having rounded Cape San Lucas, commenced the first systematic 
survey of the western coastline of California. He advanced northward in 
easy stages, charting to the best of his ability, and naming the bays, capes 
and inlets, but the nomenclature of this explorer has long since been super- 
seded by that of later discoverers. Cabrillo unhappily succumbed to hard- 
ships and privation a few months after his departure from the Mexican port 
of Navidad. Like many before and after him, he passed away on a wild and 
unfrequented coast far from his native land, whither duty called him. The 
voyage was continued by the pilot of the expedition, Ferrelo, who zealously 
continued the work of exploration. We are informed in the Spanish narra- 
tive touching this undertaking that 'the forty-first parallel of latitude was 
attained. Ferrelo probably sighted the promontory later named Cape Men- 
docino. 

At an early date the Spaniards learned to take advantage of the prevail- 
ing westerly winds of the Pacific, and from Mexican and Peruvian ports 
fleets sailed for the Philippines, China and India, but for a long time no' ves- 
sels voyaged from thence tO' Mexico or South America across the great ocean, 
as the constant " trade winds," as they have since been termed, baffled the 
efforts of the Spanish navigators to return by the way they had gone. There- 
fore, those ships which escaped destruction from storms, the sunken reefs of 
the East Indies, or the hostile natives, sailed on to Europe past the Cape of 
Good Hope, a route long known to the Portuguese engaged in the Asiatic 
trade. The Spanish government was always intensely jealous of the successes 
of the Portuguese in India and China, and on more than one memorable oc- 
casion endeavored to wrest from them the fniits of their lucrative trading 
expeditions thither. But these expeditions were generally ill-starred and 
achieved naught for Spain. At least two important armaments were launched 
from Mexico against the Portuguese, one sailing as early as tlie year 1526 
under Saavedra, and the other in 1542 in command of Ruy Lopez de Villa- 
lobos. Both ended in complete disaster.

If we can place reliance in the obscure and unsatisfactory documentary- 
evidence, which is the only instrument in the hand of the latter-day historian, 
we must honor the adventurous Friar Urdaneta, who had sailed with Magel- 
lan, as the discoverer of an eastern route to the shores of America. He 
solved the problem which had puzzled his country-men for so long and earned 
their well-merited praise by proving that it was possible to sail to and from 
the East Indies from any port on the western seaboard of America. Urdaneta 
found that by steering a northward course from the Philippines a region was 
entered where the prevailing winds blew in the direction of the American 
continent, and thereafter the Spaniards availed themselves of the peculiarities 
of the atmospheric currents, with the result, however, that on the return voy- 
ages their ships would often strike the continent far north of Mexico. 

After several abortive efforts in this direction, the Philippines had been 
subjugated by Miguel de Legazpi, with whom Urdaneta sailed as pilot. In 
this manner the Spaniards gained what they had long coveted, a secure posi- 
tion in the Far East. The potentialities of the Oriental trade were soon 
recognized, and as a natural result, Spanish shipping rapidly increased and 
before long the Pacific Ocean became an important highway of commerce. 
The authorities at Madrid were jubilant, and in a few years a lucrative traffic 
sprang up between Spain and the Philippine Archipelago, by way of the 
Isthmus of Darien, where fortified posts were maintained for the safe-guard- 
ing of the treasure and merchandise which was transferred overland from 
the shores of the Pacific to the Caribbean Sea.

CHAPTER II. 
ENGLISH BUCCANEERS. 

The trade route thus estabhshed possessed great advantages in the eyes 
of the Spaniards, as it was more or less immune from the attacks of free- 
booters, whose depredations in after years caused so much irritation and 
bitterness of feehng. For a period Spain was practically supreme on the 
Pacific, and her mariners plied their avocation of collecting tribute from 
defenseless peoples without fear of molestation at the hands of privateering 
adventurers. Firmly intrenched in their new sphere of influence as they be- 
lieved themselves to be, and perliaps placing overmuch reliance in the efficacy 
of a papal bull, by which Pope Pius IX awarded to the Spanish King vast 
regions known and unknown, the news of the arrival of English buccaneers 
on the scene of their operations came as a rude shock to the Spaniards. The 
storm of the Reformation had not yet subsided and Protestant England re- 
fused to acknowledge the rights of Spain on the Pacific to the exclusion of 
other nations, and vigorously disputed with her the claims based on such 
authority. 

John Oxenham, so far as \\&amp; can ascertain at this late date, was the 
first Englishman to sail the Pacific, With the gallant Drake he had viewed 
the ocean from the Isthmus of Darien in 1572, when, it will be remembered. 
Sir Francis, on bended knee, prayed that God would bless him in his efforts 
tO' carry the English flag upon this great sea. Two years later, in 1574, 
Oxenham left his ship on the east coast of the Isthmus, and on foot, with his 
small band of adventurous followers, crossed over to some lonely and long- 
since forgotten spot on the Pacific shore where he built a rude pinnace, forty- 
five feet in length, on which he embarked on his hazardous enterprise. A 



8 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

few small treasure galleons were captured, but the foray was only partially 
successful. On the return journey across the Isthmus, the whole expedition 
fell into the hands of the Spaniards, and the reckless Oxenham paid the pen- 
alty of his temerity with his life. He was hanged at Lima in 1575. A few 
years later Sir Francis Drake planned and executed a daring raid on the 
Spanish settlements on the South American seaboard. Leaving England 
with five ships he steered for the Strait of Magellan, but storms dispersed 
his little squadron, and Drake's own vessel, the Golden Hinde of glorious 
memory, alone reached the Pacific Ocean. Nothing daunted by his misfor- 
tunes he boldly sailed up the coast, visiting and ravaging the settlements, and 
capturing many Spanish galleons laden with treasure. Devastation marked 
his triumphal progress, and we are told that up and down the coast the mere 
mention of Drake's name struck terror to the hearts of his enemies. At 
last, satisfied with the havoc he had wrought and wishing to depart in safety 
with his rich booty, Drake sailed northward, proposing to return to Europe 
by the northwest passage of which he had heard so much. In " The World 
Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake " we read that the courageous English- 
man continued his voyage far up the northwest coast in his vain quest. He 
was at last forced to put about on account of the inclemency of the weather. 
He sailed south again, making land in the neighborhood of the thirty-eighth 
parallel of latitude on the coast of California. His exact landfall was for 
many years a matter of conjecture and dispute, but the available evidence 
seems to prove more or less conclusively that Drake's Bay, a little to the 
north of San Francisco, was the haven in which the Golden Hinde found 
refuge. Here Sir Francis had intercourse with the natives, by whom^ he 
was well received, and obtained a supply of water and fresh provisions which 
were badly needed. Drake christened the whole land New Albion and took 
l)ossession of it in the name of Queen Elizabeth. Then, rather than again 
approach the hornet's nest he had stirred up to the south, he sailed across the 
Pacific and followed the path of the Portuguese round the Cape of Good 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 9 

Hope to Europe, reaching England in 1580, after an absence of three years. 
Sir Francis was honored by Elizabeth and became the idol of the people, with 
whom his exploits on the Spanish Main were in high favor. 

The voyage of Sir Francis Drake had a somewhat important bearing on 
future events, for upon his discoveries on the northwest coast the British 
partially based their claim to the territory of Oregon when, at a later date, 
the boundary dispute occupied the attention of the diplomatists of Great 
Britain and America. Unfortunately, we have no sure means of ascertain- 
ing the exact parallel of latitude attained by Drake as his notes are by no 
means as clear as they might be upon this subject. It was advanced by the 
authorities favoring the British contention that the forty-eighth parallel was 
reached, but it is scarcely likely that the northern excursion of the noted 
buccaneer was prolonged so far. . 

The fancied impregnability of the Spanish position on the Pacific was 
thus rudely shaken. Their richly laden galleons served as a lure to the ad- 
venturous English, who delighted in humbling the power and pride of 
Spain. A few years only had elapsed after Drake's successful piratical in- 
cursion, when Thomas Cavendish, almost as celebrated as his great prototype, 
appeared ofif the west coast of South America with three small ships. Fol- 
lowing the tactics of Sir Francis Drake he pillaged and burnt the settlements 
of the Spaniards and looted their treasure ships, leaving behind him a trail 
of blood and fire. Before returning he sailed as far north as Cape San 
Lucas, where he fell in with the galleon Santa Anna having on board an 
immensely valuable cargo of merchandise from Manila. Capturing this rich 
prize, he transferred the treasure to his own vessels, then burned the craft 
to the water's edge and with the wantonness characteristic of the age, landed 
her unfortunate crew on the desolate coast and abandoned them to their fate. 
Happily for the castaways, the burned craft drifted ashore in their vicinity 
and they were able to roughly repair the damage and escape to a Mexican 
port. Vizcaino and Apostolos Valerianos (the latter better known as Juan 



10 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

de Fuca), who later played an important part in the exploration of the north- 
west coastline, were on board this ill-starred ship, and for this reason, if for 
no other, the incident just recited possesses more than ordinary interest. 

In the latter quarter of the sixteenth century English freebooters were 
more or less actively engaged in harassing the Spaniards on the Pacific. 
However, as a general rule, those who endeavored to emulate the deeds of 
Drake and Cavendish met with but indifferent success. The inaccessibility 
of the Manila trade route, and the lack of bases for the conduct of offensive 
operations proved the salvation of the Spaniards. 

Belief in the existence of the Strait of Anian, or the Northwest Passage 
as it is known to us, seemed inborn in the mariners of the sixteenth century. 
The Spanish, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the English held this faith in 
common and to their zealous, but futile, endeavors to find the Pacific inlet 
to this fabled Strait we are indebted for many of the early voyages of dis- 
covery and eventually the exploration and settlement of the Northwest Coast. 

To this belief we also owe a rich literature of adventure, the materials 
of which are contained in the records of many voyages and expeditions. The 
Spaniards after repeated attempts despaired of its existence, at least within 
the sphere oi their influence. But the belief died hard, all the more so be- 
cause from time to time the world was misled by reports of the navigation 
of the reputed waterway. The published accounts of such men as Maldo- 
nado, de Fonte and others, were believed implicity by many. Tbese bald 
falsehoods, manufactured as they were out of whole cloth, served to keep 
alive the idea that such a passage really divided the North American con- 
tinent. The early explorations on the Mexican and Californian littoral soon 
established beyond peradventure that the long sought for passage did not 
find an outlet in this region, and the fact might have had a discouraging 
effect on the progress of northwest exploration if a new reason for charting 
the Pacific coastline had not arisen. The establishment of the trade route 
to the Spice Islands has already been alluded to. It will be rem,embered that 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 11 

the ships crossed the Pacific in the path of the southwesterly trades. In re- 
turning, however, mariners were obliged to steer a northerly course so that 
their landfall on the continent was often far above Mexico. This necessi- 
tated a more or less protracted voyage along an uncharted and dangerous 
coast. Naturally enough the authorities at Madrid, bearing in mind the 
enormous value of the Philippine trade, soon determined that in order to pre- 
vent the constant loss of ships in these waters it would be necessary to find 
and chart havens of refuge for the homing treasure ships. It is impossible 
to say in what latitude the ships made the continent, but it has been stated, 
and apparently with some show of reason, that they often sighted land in 
the higher latitude of the Californian coast. There is reason to believe that 
long before Vizcaino, in 1602-3 charted the coastline between Cape San 
Lucas and the forty-third parallel, the Spanish captains engaged in the East 
Indian trade knew of the harbor of San Francisco and it is not altogether im- 
probable that they often visited this port for water and refreshment after 
their long and tedious voyages across the Pacific. 

Between the voyages of Vizcaino and that of Juan Perez in the " Santi- 
ago," which is dealt with in the next chapter, there is an interregnum of nearly 
two hundred years. During that long period, so far as contemporary evi- 
dence is available, attention from the problems of Pacific navigation, trade 
and adventure was completely withdrawn, only to be revived to greater activ- 
ity towards the close of the eighteenth century, when Spain made a final 
effort to assert her traditional sovereignty over the western and southern 
seas. England had also entered upon a new phase of naval activity, and was 
ag'ain to be brought into conflict with an European power for the supremacy 
of the ocean, this time with France, as she had once in the earlier period 
described, in conflict with Spain, and it was her destiny once more to emerge 
triumphant. Spain at this later period was struggling with adverse fate to 
regain lost ground; England was in the ascendancy, strong, aggressive and 
indomitable. A new race of sea dogs, worthy of the best traditions of the 



12 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

days of Drake, had risen in the Navy, and headed by Nelson, were more than 
ever to make the Union Jack respected and feared wherever flung to the 
breeze. In respect to the Pacific Coast of North America, the later expedi- 
tions of the Spanish were soon followed by those of the English. Interest 
was again revived in the solution of the problem of the Northwest Passage, 
and the mariners of both nations contributed much to the knowledge of this 
coast. That England should lead in this enterprise is not to be wondered at, 
considering the greatly superior vessels and improved equipment as compared 
with those of the Spaniards. That she should remain in possession while 
the Spanish retired forever from the region north of California coast was 
inevitable. Spain was a worn out and decrepit naval power, while England 
was coming to her prime, and was yet to witness her greatest triumphs. 

Juan de Fuca. 

In 1592, just a century after the discovery of America by Columbus, 
the Viceroy of Mexico sent a Gi*eek pilot, known among the Spaniards of that 
colony as Juan de Fuca, on a voyage of discovery to the north Pacific Ocean. 
This navigator followed the coast till he reached an inlet up which he sailed 
for more than twenty days. The entrance of the strait was marked by a 
great headland or island on which was an exceedingly high pinnacle of spired 
rock. This strait which grew wider as the explorer proceeded contained 
numerous islands. Juan de Fuca landed at several places and found the 
natives dressed in the skins of beasts. He observed that the land was fruit- 
ful and reported that it was rich in gold, silver, pearls and other things like 
New Spain. Sailing on he reached a broader sheet of water of which he 
S]X)ke as the North Sea. He then returned to Acapulco. The inland waters 
thus explored are known now as the Straits of Juan de Fuca and Georgia. 
This is alluded to in the following extract from Robert Greenhow's " Historic 
Memoirs of the Northwest Coast :" " The discrepancies to be observed in 
the narrative of de Fuca are few and slight and are all within the limits of 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 13 

supposable error on the part of the Greek, especially when his advanced 
age, and the circumstances that he spoke only from recollection are consid- 
ered; while on the other hand, the coincidences are too great and too strik- 
ing to be fairly attributed to chance. 

" It may, therefore, be undoubtedly admitted that Fuca entered the strait 
now bearing his name, and that he may also have passed entirely through it, 
but that he, an experienced navigator,' should have conceived that by sailing 
thirty leagues east and then eighty leagues northwest by west he had arrived 
in the Atlantic is wholly incredible." 

The explorer not receiving the rewards he expected from the viceroy 
and the Spanish king returned disappointed to his home in Cephalonia. On 
his way thither in 1596 he met at Florence an English sea-captain, John 
Douglas, who introduced him to Michael Lx)ck, an influential merchant. So 
greatly were these Englishmen impressed with the truthfulness of the story 
told by the old mariner and of the importance of his discovery that they en- 
deavored through Lord Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh and Richard Hakluyt, 
famous for his publication of works of travel and exploration, to induce 
Queen Elizabeth to employ de Fuca to make discoveries on England's be- 
half. To take the explorer to England £100 was needed and the British 
Government was asked to furnish the money. It was not sent and when in 
t6o2 Lock found himself in a position to advance it out of his own funds 
Juan de Fuca was on his deathbed. The opportunity had passed and it was 
almost two hundred years before the flag of England was planted on the 
Northwest Coast.

CHAPTER III. 
LATER EXPLORERS. 

The next explorations of which we have any authentic record were those 
of Juan Perez and his pilot, Estevan Jose Martinez, who set sail from San 
Bias in January, 1774, on the Spanish corvette, Santiago, to explore the coast 
between the forty-third and the sixtieth parallels of north latitude. The San- 
tiago spent the winter at Monterey. Leaving that harbor on the sixth of 
June Perez sailed north and sighted land in latitude fifty-four degrees. He 
named the most northerly point of land Cape San Margarita. It is now 
known as North Cape on the extreme north of the Queen Charlotte Islands, 
The navigator then turned his prow southward and on the ninth of August, 
the eve of the festival of St. Lawrence, reached latitude forty-nine degrees 
thirty minutes. Here he found anchorage which he piously named San 
Lorenzo. The natives offered him skins in exchange for articles of iron, 
showing that they had previously learned the value of that most useful of 
metals. Father Brabant, a Roman Catholic priest stationed on the west 
coast of Vancouver Island, told Captain Walbrau, C. G. S., of the following 
tradition current among the Indians at Hesquiat and Nootka Sound, which 
he believed related to this visit of the Santiago : 

" One day, many, many years ago, the Indians, one morning, looking out 
to sea from a village called Oum-mis, saw between the Hole-in-the-Wall 
and Sunday Rock a large object floating on the water which, at first; they 
took to be a very large bird. But when it came nearer, near enough to see 
people moving about on it, they concluded among themselves that it was a 
very big canoe and that the strangers were their dead chiefs coming back 
from the dead. The ship came close into a place called Patcista, a bay 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 15 

marked on the chart as a g'ood landing place for boats, between Sunday Rock 
and Escalante Reef, and there stayed a short time." 

The Santiago returned from San Lorenzo to San Bias and the next 
year was sent on a second expedition under command of Captain Don Bruno 
Heceta with Juan Perez as one of his officers. She was accompanied by a 
little vessel, the Sonora, thirty-six feet long, twelve wide and eight deep. 
To the gallant and persevering officers of this tiny craft, Don Juan Francisco 
de la Bodega y Quadra and Antonio Maurelle, is chiefly due the credit of 
explorations made during this voyage. Leaving San Bias on the sixteenth 
of March they surveyed the coast till they reached the vicinity of the en- 
trance into the strait discovered by Fuca. Here the ships were driven south- 
ward by a storm. They found anchorage between a small island and the 
coast. The crew of a boat sent on shore for wood and water was murdered 
by the natives. The Sonora was also attacked, but although there were only 
three men left on board capable of bearing arms the savages were driven 
back with a loss of six men. The island where the disaster occurred was 
called Isle de Dolores. Heceta now wanted to return but Quadra urged him 
to continue his voyage. He complied, but about a week afterward, the ves- 
sels having been separated by a storm, the Santiago began her homeward 
journey. Ten days later her commander discovered the mouth of a large 
river, the Columbia, which is marked on the Spanish charts of 1788, Rio San 
Roque. The little Sonora with her diminished crew proceeded on her 
voyage. On the sixteenth of August she reached what is now known as 
Mount Edgecombe, '' which was of the most regular and beautiful form they 
had ever seen, the top of it covered with snow and beneath this top caused 
by the snow lying in deep gullies, white and dark stri])es were regularly 
fornied down the mountain side." The next day at a place which the Span- 
iards called Port de los Remedies, but which is now known as the Bay of 
Islands, Quadra erected a cross, carved another on the rock and took formal 
possession of the territory in the name of the king of Spain. The natives 



16 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of this place carried off the wooden cross and placed it in front of one of 
their houses. The mouth of the river which emptied into the bay was filled 
with salmon, which were caught by the natives and sold to the explorers. 
On the twenty-second of August Quadra proceeded northward and reached 
latitude fifty-eight degrees. The weather became very cold and stormy and 
as only Quadra himself and Maurelle were well enough to navigate the ship 
they were obliged to set out on their homeward voyage. Threading her way 
among the islands and promontories so numerous on this coast the Sonora 
at length found shelter in a large bay in latitude fifty-five degrees thirty min- 
utes, which Quadra named Port Bucarelli. Here the weather-worn sailors 
found rest and refreshment. It is curious to learn that they attributed the 
grateful warmth of this sheltered haven to an active volcano which they saw 
burning in the distance. 

Passing by and naming Cape St. Augustine the explorers saw and 
named Perez Sound, now known as Dixon Entrance. Here a southwesterly 
storm drove them north and again the indefatigable mariners had hopes of 
accomplishing their mission and reaching the sixtieth parallel, but sickness 
reappearing they abandoned their purpose and set out on their return. They 
reached Monterey on the seventh of October and on the twentieth of No- 
vember, 1775, arrived at San Bias. 

In 1779 Quadra and Maurelle accompanied Lieutenant Artega on a third 
expedition to the Northwest Coast. They examined and surveyed the bay 
at Port Bucarelli discovered in 1775, saw Mount St. Elias and entered the 
large inlet now called Prince William Sound just beyond the sixtieth par- 
allel which Quadra had striven so hard to reach in the preceding voyage. 
The Spaniards contented themselves with these discoveries and it was not 
till British merchants had begun to occupy the Northwest Coast that they 
returned to prosecute their explorations and to drive off, if possible, those 
whom they looked upon as trespassers. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA _ 17 

Captain Cook. 

In 1588 the renowned Englishman, Sir Francis Drake, sailed by the 
western coast of North America and named the region New Albion. As 
far as can be ascertained he did not reach a higher latitude than California. 
It was one hundred' and ninety years before another visit of a British ship 
to this coast is recorded. On the seventh of March, 1778, Captain James 
Cook, the celebrated navigator, sighted land about one hundred miles north 
of Cape Mendocino. He had set sail from Plymouth nearly two years be- 
fore in command of His Majesty's ships, Resolution and Discovery. He had 
spent much time in exploring the southern seas and had discovered the Sand- 
wich or Hawaiian Islands. His instructions were to endeavor to fall in with 
the coast in the latitude of forty-five degrees and then examine it to the lati- 
tude of sixty-five degrees, but not to lose any time in exploring rivers or in- 
lets until he had reached the latter parallel. At the fifty-sixth parallel he was 
to search for a passage pointing towards Hudson's or Baffin's Bay, and if 
found, to attempt to make his way through; if no passage was found, then 
he was to visit the Russian establishments in that latitude and to explore the 
seas nothwards, as far and as completely as he could. 

A little northwest of the forty-eighth parallel Cook observed a point of 
land to which he gave the name of Cape Flattery. The weather here was 
very stormy and no sign of Juan de Fuca strait could be observed. The old 
Greek navigator had stated that the passage was between the forty-seventh 
and forty-eighth parallels, and as Captain Cook could not find it there he 
came to the conclusion that no such strait existed. Keeping on his course 
he discovered land on the twenty-ninth of March, 1778, in latitude forty- 
nine degrees twenty-eight minutes north. Here he found a large bay into 
which he entered and to which he gave the name of Nootka Sound. He 
stayed here four weeks, thoroughly refitted his ships and made a plan of a 
portion of the sound. He found the natives very friendly and not disposed 



18 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

to interfere with him; in any way. They wore ornaments of brass and used 
implements of iron. One of the men adorned his person with two silver 
teaspoons of Spanish make. The Indians, nevertheless, declared no ship had 
entered that bay before so it was supposed the articles were obtained from 
other tribes who had held communication with the Spaniards. The natives 
brought him furs in exchange for various articles of ' small value. These 
furs the sailors made into coats or bed covering. On the twenty-sixth of 
April, Captain Cook was again ready for sea. Soon after he saw the beauti- 
ful mountain described by the Spanish pilot Maurelle and named it Mount 
Edgecombe. Cook skirted the coast of Alaska, naming Mount Fairweather, 
Cross Sound and Cross Cape. He saw Mount St. Elias, discovered by the 
explorer Behring, and found two large bays. To the first he gave the name 
of Prince William's Sound, the second has been called in his honor Cook's 
Inlet. Calling at Unalaska and then sailing westward, Cook touched at the 
most western point of the continent, naming it Cape Prince of Wales. He 
then crossed the channel, thirty-six miles wide at this place, and reached the 
opposite shore of Asia at East Cape. It was Cook who gave the strait, which 
separates the contments of Asia and America, the name of Behring Strait, in 
honor of the explorer, Behring, who had passed through it fifty years before. 
It was now October and Cook, finding he could proceed no further north, 
sailed for the Sandwich Islands to winter. He intended to return next spring 
to pursue his investigations, but was murdered by the natives in February, 
1779. Captain Clerke succeeded to the command of the ships, but neither 
was he able to pierce the icy barrier. Like his commander he died in exile, 
falling a victim to consumption at Petropavlovsky, in Kamschatka. Before 
returning to England the ships, now under command of Captain Gore, went 
to China. The sailors received such handsome prices for the furs they had 
got at Nootka Sound that they wanted their commander to return thither to 
get more. When, as in duty bound, he refused there was almost a mutiny 
on board the Resolution and Discovery. The ships did not reach England 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 19 

till 1780 and it was 1784 before the account of Cook's third voyage with 
the charts of the northwest coast made by him and his officers was published. 
No sooner was the news of the discovery of this rich fur-bearing region given 
to the world than a great number of ships made their way thither. The first 
to arrive at Nootka Sound was a little vessel from China in 1785, com- 
manded by Captain Hanna, who was able to obtain furs which he sold for 
twenty-six thousand dollars. During 1786 Hanna returned to find that two 
of the East India Company's vessels, the Captain Cook and the Experiment, 
had visited the place in his absence and that they had left no furs behind 
them,. An adventurous seaman, John McKay, surgeon's mate of the " Cap- 
tain Cook," had voluntarily remained at Nootka Sound to study the language, 
customs and manners of the natives. Not being able to obtain furs at this 
place Hanna visited the inlets to the northwest of Vancouver Island and 
named many of them, as well as the capes. Queen Charlotte Sound was in 
1786 discovered and named -by the officers of the " Captain Cook " and " Ex- 
periment," who had returned on another trading expedition. A notable 
event of the same year was the visit of the famous French explorer, La 
Perouse. He was the first to suggest that the Queen Charlotte Islands were 
not part of the mainland of North America. At the only place at which 
this explorer landed he had the misfortune to lose two boat's crews consisting 
of twenty-one men. He himself with both his ships was lost near Australia 
on the homeward voyage. 

Captain Meares. 

In the autumn of 1786 two vessels, the " Nootka " and the " Sea Otter," 
sent out from. Calcutta arrived on the coast of Alaska. The commander of the 
former vessel,' Captain Meares, was to fill an important place in the history of 
British Columbia. He was a lieutenant in the British navy on half pay. 
When in October the " Nootka " arrived at her destination. King William's 
Sound, she found that the " Sea Otter " had been there and obtained her 



20 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

cargo of furs and sailed away. No further tidings of this vessel were ever 
heard. Meares being obliged to winter on this inhospitable shore lost the 
greater number of his officers and crew from scurvy. In the spring his 
distress was relieved by the arrival of two trading ships from England. In 
return for their aid the captains of these vessels insisted that Meares should 
not carry on any further traffic with the Indians on the coast, but should, as 
soon as possible, return to China. He therefore set sail for Macao. He 
reached the harbor of Typa and ended his disastrous voyage by being forced, 
during a gale, which sprang up after he had anchored, to run his ship aground. 

The ships that arrived in King William's Sound in the spring of 1787 
were the " King George," Captain Portlock, and the " Queen Charlotte," Cap- 
tain Dixon. They were the first fur-traders to arrive direct from London, 
and their vessels were well equipped with everything needed for a successful 
venture. Leaving King William's Sound, Dixon sailed southward, trading 
as he went. On the twenty-sixth of July he reached a cape which foiTned 
the southern extremity of the land along which he had been sailing. He 
called the point Cape St. James and rounding it, steered tO' the north. He 
soon saw, as Perouse had suspected, that he had been following the coast of 
a large island or group of islands and gave them the name of his vessel, the 
Queen Charlotte. Dixon then steered his course for Nootka, expecting to 
meet his consort the " King George." On the way he fell in with the " Prince 
of Wales " and the " Princess Royal " vessels, belonging to the same company 
as his own, that of the Messrs. Etches, merchant traders, and learned from 
them that the " Prince George " was not at Nootka. He then set sail for 
Macao where he met his consort. Their furs were sold for fifty-four thou- 
sand eight hundred and fifty-seven dollars, and having loaded their ships with 
tea, Portlock and Dixon returned to England. 

Captain Duncan of the " Princess Royal" was the first of the fur-traders 
to pursue his calling along the coast of the mainland. Calvert and Princess 
Royal Islands, as well as Safety Cove, still bear the names given by him. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 21 

He was rewarded for his enterprise and boldness by a splendid cargo of those 
sea otter skins, which were the only furs sought by these early traders. 

In 1787 Barclay Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island was dis- 
covered by Captain Barclay of the " Imperial Eagle," who brought his wife 
with him on this hazardous voyage. The natives, who had previously mur- 
dered the Spaniards, had not changed in the interval, for a party from the 
Imperial Eagle who imprudently went up a small river in one of the boats 
near the Isle de Dolores to trade, were murdered. From this circumstance 
Barclay re-named the place Destruction Island. A brother of the king of 
Nootka, chief Comekela, was taken away in the Imperial Eagle when she 
sailed for China. The next year, 1788, saw the arrival of the first ships 
from the United States. These were the " Columbia," Captain John Ken- 
drick, and the "Lady Washington," Captain Robert Gray. The next year 
the captains exchanged ships and Gray with the " Columbia " returned to 
Boston by way of China and the Cape of Good Hope, arriving in port on 
August ninth, 1790. A medal was struck in Boston to commemorate this 
voyage, which, as we shall see, was not so important as that made in the suc- 
ceeding year. 

Meanwhile Captain Meares, nothing daunted by his terrible experience 
in King William's Sound, had undertaken a second voyage to the shores of 
North America. This time he was bound for Nootka Sound and had deter- 
mined to establish a trading post there. His expedition consisted of two 
ships, the " Felice " commanded by himself, and the " Iphigenia Nubiana," 
under Captain William Douglas. Both vessels were really owned by a com- 
pany of British merchants resident in Canton, but to evade the heavy dues 
levied by China on all foreign vessels except those belonging to Portugal, the 
questionable expedients of sailing under the Portuguese flag and making out 
papers in the name of a Portuguese were resorted to. 

The sixteenth of May, 1788, was a memorable day at Nootka Sound. 
The " Felice " had arrived on the thirteenth and found that the chiefs of 



22 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Nootka, Maquinna and Callicum, were absent at Clayoquot on a visit of state 
to Wicananish, a powerful chief who Hved there. On the sixteenth they re- 
turned and seeing- the " Felice " in the harbor, these painted and befeathered 
potentates rowed round her singing an address of welcome. Captain Meares 
had brought back with him, Comekela, who had been taken away the year 
before by the " Imperial Eagle." This chief was returned to his tribe clad in 
a scarlet coat, a military hat and all the ornaments which he had been able 
to obtain. Absurd as was the figure he presented to European eyes, his 
gorgeous array was much admired by his countrymen, and he was greeted 
with shouts of welcome and a feast made in his honor. 

After these friendly demonstrations were over Captain Meares procured 
from King Maquinna a piece of land on the shores of a part of the sound, with 
the appropriate name of Friendly Cove, in exchange for ten sheets of copper 
and other trifling articles. Here he erected a large building to serve for 
workshop, storehouse, and dwelling, surrounded it with a breastwork defended 
by one cannon. This work completed he raised for the first time on the 
western coast of America the British flag. This little establishment of 
Meares was the earliest recorded attempt at settlement made by white men 
on the northwest coast south of the Russian possessions. Captain Meares 
set his men at work building a ship and proceeded southward on a trading 
and exploring expedition. He visited the redoubtable Wicananish, whom he 
had met at Nootka, and being kindly received, anchored in a secure harbor. 
To this place he gave the name of Port Con, after one of the owners of the 
" Felice." After the universal Indian custom the visitors were feasted. In 
return for this hospitality Meares presented Wicananish with two copper 
kettles and some blankets. So highly were these presents esteemed that the 
chief gave in return fifty splendid sea otter skins, the value of which would 
not be less than two thousand five hundred dollars. The fame of the kettles 
spread far and wide and Wicananish was forced to part with them to a 
hostile and rrwore powerful tribe. Proceeding on his journey Captain Meares 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 23 

recognized the spired reck described nearly two hundred years before by 
Juan de Fuca, and saw stretching away to the east the channel whose exist- 
ence Cook and others of the early voyagers to this coast had denied. Meares 
at once named the inlet the Strait of Juan de Fuca. In the evening the 
" Felice " crossed to a barren island at the south side of the opening. Here 
they encountered Tatooche, a powerful Indian chief, and a large number of 
his warriors. The Indians at first showed signs of hostility and Tatooche 
said the country to the south belonged to him. In the end, however, the 
Indians who were seated in their canoes entertained their visitors with a 
song which Captain Meares speaks of in this way : 

" Situated, as we were, on a wild and unfrequented coast in a distant 
corner of the globe, far removed from all those -friends, connections and cir- 
cumstances which form the charm and comfort of life and taking' our course 
as it were through a solitary ocean ; in such a situation the simple melody of the 
natives proceeding in perfect unison, and exact measure from four hundred 
voices found its way to our hearts, and at the same moment awakened and 
becalmed many a painful thought." 

Nothing strikes the reader of the accounts of most of the early voyagers 
more than the prudence and forbearance which the British sailors exercised 
towards the natives. On the one hand they guarded against attack and on 
the other they used every means to gain the good will of the savages. The 
barren island from which Tatooche had come still bears his name. Not hav- 
ing time to explore the strait, Meares set out to look for the river which the 
Spaniards had named San Roque. Although he named the promontory to 
the north of the mouth of its estuary. Cape Disappointment, and the water 
to tlie south of it. Deception Bay, Meares could discern no sign of the great 
river. The explorer then returned tO' Barclay Sound, named Cape Beale, and 
took possession of Juan de Fuca Strait and the adjoining territory in the 
name of King George. He sent out a boat to examine the Strait of Fuca 
and get if possible a load of furs. The natives proved unfriendly, and after 



24 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

a sharp encounter at what is now Port San Juan, her officer was glad to re- 
turn to the ship. He reported that the strait was many leagues broad with 
a clear horizon stretching away to the northeastward. When Meares reached 
Friendly Cove he found that King Maquinna had kept faith with him and 
that the fame of the building of the white man's canoe had attracted the In- 
dians from all directions. Towards the end of August the " Iphigenia " 
arrived, having visited rnany places along the coast of the mainland between 
Cook's River and the north of Vancouver Island. On the twentieth of Sep- 
tember the new ship was launched and called the Northwest America. In 
honor of the event salutes were fired from the " Felice " and the " Iphigenia," 
and the cannon on shore was discharged, greatly to the delight of the natives. 
Captain Gray of the " Washington " was present at the ceremony. A little 
later Captain Meares set sail for China on the " Felice " with all the furs that 
had been collected, giving orders that the " Iphigenia " and the " Northwest 
America," which had been put in charge of Robert Hunter, mate of the 
" Felice," should winter at the Sandwich Islands, returning as soon as possible 
in the spring to resume the fur trade. 

Meares promised to return as soon as possible to build more houses and 
to introduce among his western friends the manners and customs of the far 
east. Maquinna before his departure performed the ceremony of doing 
homage to his English friend. He took his tiara of feathers, placed it on 
Meares' head and dressed him in his robe of otter skins. Thus arrayed 
Meares was requested to sit down on a chest filled with human bones, Ma- 
quinna placing himself on the ground. The chief's example was followed 
by all the natives present when they sang one of their plaintive songs. Thus 
were the British in the person of Meares acknowledged sovereigns of Nootka 
Sound. Vancouver Island in those days must have had a considerable 
population. In the three villages of Nootka, Clayoquot and Port Con there 
were twelve thousand souls. 

Meares left for China delighted with what he had achieved and hoping 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 25 

that the future held in store for him still greater successes. Alas for the 
vanity of human expectations! His prosperity was shortlived and his plans 
came to naught. When the " Iphigenia " and the " Northwest America " 
returned next spring they found that the United States ships the " Columbia " 
and " Washington " had wintered in Nootka Sound. The " Northwest 
America " was at once sent off to forestall if possible the American traders in 
the rocky marts to the north. As the " Iphigenia " lay in the harbor of 
Nootka on the sixth of May, a Spanish ship of war, the " Princesa," under 
command of Don Stephen Joseph Martinez, arrived from San Bias followed 
on the thirteenth by a smaller vessel, the " San Carlos." At first Captain 
Douglas and Don Martinez were very friendly, but the day after the arrival 
of the " San Carlos " the Spaniards seized the " Iphigenia," put her officers 
in irons and took possession, in the name of the king of Spain, of the land 
and buildings belonging to Meares. The vessel was then stripped of all her 
stores, provisions and merchandise, even her instruments and charts were 
carried away. The only thing left was some bars of iron. The Spanish 
commander had tried to induce Captain Douglas to sell him the " Northwest 
America," but not being able to effect his purpose he had insisted upon his 
writing to her captain ordering him to deliver his vessel to the Spaniards. 
Douglas wrote a letter, though he did not give the directions ordered. When 
it had been delivered to Don Martinez the British ship was allowed to sail 
to China badly fitted out for such a long; cruise. However, after getting 
supplies at the Sandwich Islands in return for the iron which had been left 
on board, she reached Macao, much to the relief and surprise of her captain. 
The " Northwest America " was in her turn seized, her cargo of furs taken 
from her and her crew put on board the " Columbia." She was then sent out 
on a trading cruise by the Spaniards. The captain of the " Columbia " at the 
request of Don Martinez gave these British sailors a passage to China. When 
Meares returned to China he sold the " Felice " and his company allying 
themselves with Etches Brothers, he obtained control of the " Princess 



26 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Royal " and a litle ship named the " Argonaut." James Colnett was put in 
charge of these vessels and in the spring of 1789 they sailed for Nootka 
Sound. As soon as the " Argonaut" appeared in sight Don Martinez came 
out to meet her, and by pretending to be in distress induced Captain Colnett 
to come into Friendly Cove and furnish him with such supplies as the Span- 
iards required. When the British captain hesitated about putting his vessel 
under the guns of two foreign ships, Don Martinez assured him that he had 
only come to the Nootka to prevent the Russians from settling on that part 
of the coast, and pledged his word as a Spanish gentleman that, having given 
him the supplies necessary for his relief, the captain of the Argonaut might 
sail away at his own convenience. Captain Colnett, hiriiself an officer in the 
British navy, and an honorable gentleman, trusted the perfidious Spaniard, 
but no sooner was he in his power than he and his officers were imprisoned, 
his sailors put in irons and his ship and cargo seized, \yhen the " Princess 
Royal " appeared a few days after she was treated in a similar way. Al- 
though Spain and England were at peace the ships were taken to San Bias as 
prizes, their officers and crew treated with every indignity and their com- 
mander frequently threatened with instant death. Arriving at San Bias the 
Englishmen were induced by promises of speedy release to repair the " Ar- 
gonaut " and get her ready for sea. When this was done their inhuman cap- 
tors laughed at their credulity and sent the ship away on a voyage for their 
own benefit. The prisoners were then, however, removed to Tepeak, where 
they had the good fortune to meet with the commander of the squandron, Don 
Bodega y Quadra, who obtained for Captain Colnett permission to go to 
Mexico to lay his case before the Viceroy of Spain. On hearing his story that 
dignitary, Don Revillagigeda, ordered that his vessels should be returned to 
him, and that having been supplied with all necessaries he should be allowed to 
return to China. Thus after fifteen months' unlawful capture these British 
subjects obtained release. 

When news of these highhanded proceedings reached England there was 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 27 

great indignation. The Spaniards answered the demand for reparation and 
satisfaction by declaring that British subjects had no rights on the northwest 
coast of America, as it belonged to Spain by virtue of previous discovery. 
England was firm in her demands and for a time war seemed imminent. 
Eventually, however, a convention was formed and the treaty of Nootka 
agreed upon. By the terms of this treaty all lands or buildings taken from 
British subjects must be restored to them. Payment must be made for all 
goods or other property seized or destroyed. The subjects of either nation 
were to be free to settle or trade on any part of the western coast of America 
north of the present Spanish settlements. 

Don Martinez was at once recalled from Nootka by the Spanish govern- 
ment. His place was taken by Commander Elisa, who was shortly after 
succeeded by the humane and chivalrous Quadra. An instance of the in- 
humanity of Martinez towards the natives is given in Meares' voyages and 
was witnessed by the captain of the " Northwest America." The Indian 
chief Callicum, who had treated the English at Friendly Cove with the great- 
est kindness and perfect good faith, came one day to the " Princesa " to pre- 
sent some fish to the commodore. He had with him in his canoe his wife 
and child. He was received rudely and as he rowed away uttered an im- 
patient exclamation. Instantly he was shot through the heart. The 
wretches who committed this wanton murder would only allow the bereaved 
father to recover his son's body when he had purchased the privilege by bring- 
ing them a sufficient number of furs. 

The British government appointed George Vancouver a commissioner to 
proceed to Nootka and receive from the Spanish commandant stationed there 
whatever tracts or parcels of land at Nootka and in the vicinity thereof Brit- 
ish subjects had been dispossessed of in the year 1789. He was by the admi- 
ralty placed in command of His Majesty's ships " Discovery " and "Chatham," 
with orders to proceed to the Pacific Ocean to survey the coast of America 
from latitude thirty degrees to sixty degrees north and to ascertain what 



28 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

passage if any existed to the eastward. How Vancouver carried out his in- 
structions will form the subject of the following pages. We will close this 
with a brief description of the Spanish explorations of this period. While 
Captain Colnett and his crew were toiling beneath the heat of a burning sun 
to fit the " Argonaut " for a voyage, the " Princess Royal," transformed into 
the " Princesa Real," was under command of the Spanish lieutenant, Quimper, 
sailing along the southern shore of Vancouver Island. He landed at what is 
now Sooke Inlet, in June, 1790, named it Porto de Revillagigeda and took 
possession of the region in the name of the king of Spain. On the last day 
of the month he anchored in Esquimalt harbor, which he named Port Cor- 
dova, after Bucareti, the forty-sixth viceroy of Mexico. An exploring party 
.discovered the San Juan archipelago and Haro strait, which still bears the 
name given it by Quimper. He crossed to the opposite shore, but stormy 
weather prevented his making any further discoveries and he proceeded to 
the Sandwich Islands, where the ship met her rightful owner. Captain Col- 
nett, and he, by order of the Spanish government, was put in possession of 
her. 

Captain Vancouver. 

To none of her explorers does British Columbia owe such a debt as to 
Captain Vancouver. Others came to her shores to enrich themselves by de- 
pleting the rocks and waters of the animals whose beautiful furs rendered 
them the prey of the remorseless hunter. Vancouver, in the pursuit of his 
duty, spent busy days and toilsome nights to bring her coasts to the knowl- 
edge of civilized man. From the day that he first viewed her rocky shores 
till hand and brain were still in death, he was occupied either in threading 
the intricate passages that wind in and out among her labyrinths of islands, 
in exploring the deep fiords that stretch inland through the shaggy forests 
which clothe the slopes of the mountains overlooking the ocean, or in pre- 
paring a record of his voyages. By the help of his charts the mariner can 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 29 

navigate the waters of the north Pacific, and in many places nothing has been 
added to the knowledge gained by him and his gallant stafif of officers. 

Vancouver left England on April i, 1791, in command of two of His 
Majesty's ships, the " Discovery " and the " Chatham." He sailed by the 
Cape of Good Hope, did some surveying on the coast of Australia and landed 
at Dusky Bay, New Zealand, to refit his vessels. At the Society Islands, 
where he had been twice before, Vancouver received a warm welcome from 
the natives. He called at Hawaii to leave a native called Towereroo, who 
had been taken to England, with his friends and to survey more thoroughly 
these islands where his beloved superior officer. Captain Cook, had met so 
terrible a fate. It was the eighteenth of April, 1792, before Vancouver 
arrived on the coast of America. The first land seen was in the neighbor- 
hood of Cape Mendocino. As he neared the straits of Juan de Fuca the 
United States ship " Columbia," Captain Gray, was spoken. Gray told Van- 
couver that he had been at the mouth of a large river a few days before, but 
was prevented by the current from entering it. A shore time after, how- 
ever. Gray was able to sail up the river and anchor about ten miles from its 
mouth. He gave it the name of his vessel, a very appropriate one, the Co- 
lumbia. 

As Vancouver's ships neared Cape Flattery on the twenty-ninth of April, 
a storm came on which added to the gloom^ of that wild region. The next 
day, however, the weather cleared and as the vessels sailed up the strait the 
sky was so cloudless and the sea so smooth that Vancouver was able in the 
afternoon to take a lunar observation. A little later a magnificent mountain 
peak, whose snow-covered head reflected the beams of the setting sun, was 
seen and received the name of Lieutenant Baker of the " Discovery." In 
remembrance of a similar formation of land on the shores of England, a low 
sandy spit near which the ships were brought to anchor was called New 
Dungeness. On May first the boats were lowered for exploration. In 
the evening a large bay was discovered with an island protecting the en- 



30 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

trance. The ships were anchored in this bay, which was called Port Discov- 
ery and the island Protection Island. There were not many natives in the 
neighborhood, and those that were seen seemed to pay no attention to the 
strangers. The boats were again embarked and Vancouver set out on his 
cruise in the winding sheet of water which still recalls the name of Lieutenant 
Puget. Whidby Island, near the entrance of the sound, was called after the 
most indefatigable of Vancouver's assistants, the master of the Discovery, 
Joseph Whidby. Many bays, promontories, islands and inlets were ex- 
amined and named by Vancouver and his officers. On May twenty-ninth, 
1792, the survey of Hood's Canal, Admiralty Inlet and Puget Sound hav- 
ing been completed, Vancouver, at what is now Port Blakely, but which he 
called Restoration Point, took solemn possession of the country in the name 
of George III. A turf was turned, the British jflag hoisted, the crews drank 
the king's health and the guns on the ship fired a salute. On June fifth a 
northward voyage was begun. The ships passed out of Admiralty Inlet and 
anchored in Birch Bay, near Point Roberts, now on the international bound- 
ary. The boats were sent out. After examining Point Roberts they saw 
that there was no shelter on the shoals near for the night' that was coming 
on. They rowed across to the western shore and spent the night in the 
shelter of a rocky bluff. The next day the explorers returned and landed at 
Point Grey. The distance between Point Roberts and Point Grey is nineteen 
miles. Into this part of the Gulf of Georgia empties the Fraser River. Why 
Vancouver did not read in the shoals at this place, and in the discoloration of 
the waters of the sea, the signs of a large river has ever since been a mystery. 
But if the Fraser River was missed Burrard Inlet was thoroughly explored. 
The place was a solitude. Had Vancouver any premonition that the shores 
would be covered with a great city, and that ships compared with which his 
own would seem only a tiny craft would convey the merchandise of the world 
to its marts? And so Vancouver sailed on, naming as he went waters and 
islands after his friends of high or low degree. As the boats returned from 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 31 

Jervis Inlet vessels were seen at anchor near Point Grey. These proved to 
be Spanish men-of-war under command respectively of Lieutenants Galiano 
and Valdez, which had sailed from.Nootka June fifth on an exploring expedi- 
tion. They were in search of a large river said by the Indians to exist on 
the coasts which Vancouver had been exploring, but as yet they had been 
unable to find it. E^ch of these exploring parties showed the other their 
charts and journals and they worked together three weeks. The Indians, 
the Spaniards reported, said that the waters in which they were sailing united 
with the ocean to the north. Vancouver named it the Gulf of Georgia. 
Several villages of the natives were visited on the coast of the mainland and 
some trading was done here. Passing through the narrow and dangerous 
channel called after one of his officers, Johnstone Strait, the vessels reached 
Queen Charlotte Sound, where they narrowly escaped being wrecked. The 
coast was examined as far as fifty-two degrees eighteen minutes north, when 
the trading brig " Venus,'' which had lately visited Nootka, appeared in sight. 
Her captain informed Vancouver that his store ship, the " Daedalus," had 
arrived at that place. As her commander had been murdered in the Sand- 
wich Islands, Vancouver determined to sail straight for Nootka. When he 
arrived there he found that Quadra, the Spanish commandant, had preceded 
him. The British officers were courteously received and hospitably treated 
by Quadra and the warmest friendship grew up between the two commanders. 
When Vancouver, however, asked for the surrender of the lands which 
he had been authorized to receive. Quadra declared that his instructions from 
the Spanish court did not agree with the tenor of Vancouver's commission. 
Vancouver then sent Zachary Mudge, first lieutenant of the Discovery, in a 
Portuguese brig to China with dispatches which he was to deliver in England 
as soon as possible. Quadra left Nootka for Monterey in September, but 
before he went the large island of which Vancouver had completed the survey 
begun many years ago by the Spaniards, was at Quadra's suggestion named 
by Vancouver the Island of Quadra and Vancouver. A month later Van- 



32 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

couver sailed for San Francisco with the purpose of exploring- the Columbia 
on his way. When he arrived at the mouth of the river the weather was 
stormy and he was obliged to commit to- Brouffhton, the commander of the 
smaller vessel, the task of exploration. The Chatham sailed about a hundred 
miles up the river, and Broug-hton took possession of it and the adjoining 
territory in the name of the king of England, claiming that as the United 
States, Captain Gray, had only proceeded ten miles from the coast he had 
not really discovered the river — not a very ingenuous contention. This ex- 
plorer learned from an old Indian that higher up falls obstructed the river 
and that it had its source very far to the eastward. The " Discovery," the 
" Chatham " and the " Daedalus " all met at Monterey on September 26, 
1792. Here Vancouver renewed his intercouse with his friend Quadra and 
dispatched Captain Broughton overland to England to learn how he should 
proceed in the Nootka difficulty. This winter was also spent in the Sand- 
wich Islands. Here Vancouver charged himself with the duty of bringing 
the murderers of the officers of the " Daedalus " to justice. He succeeded in 
discovering the culprits and in prevailing upon one of their native chiefs to 
perform the office of executioner. By the end of May the explorers were 
again at work at Fitzhugh Sound, the place where they had finished their 
labors the previous autumn. During this season the coast was explored to 
within the borders of Alaska. Much time and care were spent in examining 
the region on what is now the extreme northern coast of British Columbia, 
for an old voyager, Admiral Fuentes, had reported that a large opening ex- 
isted there and that from, it a chain of lakes extended across the continent. 
Vancouver himself took charge of one of the expeditions, which wound in 
and out of the coast for seven hundred miles, where a direct course north 
would have extended only sixty miles. On this journey Vancouver's boat 
was attacked by a party of natives whose leader was an old woman. At first 
the gallant officer attempted to get rid of his dangerous visitors without blood- 
shed, but finding all his efforts vain he gave the order to fire. At the first 




OREGON RUFFED GROUSE. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 33 

volley the Indians took to the water and, using their canoes as shields, soon 
disappeared. From that time onwards the utmost vigilance was used to be 
ready for attack and prevent it if possible. Needless to say. Fuentes passage 
was not discovered. During this season Vancouver's ships were for some 
time anchored in Observatory Inlet, where it will be remembered the inter- 
national boundary between the British and United States possessions begins. 
The explorations were continued northward past the mouth of the Stickine 
River to a place called Cape Decision, where on September 21, 1793, they 
were concluded for the season. After calling at Nootka, Vancouver pro- 
ceeded south and finished his survey in that direction, which ended at the 
thirtieth parallel of north latitude. The winter was spent in exploring the 
Sandwich Islands. From the tropical luxuriance of these islands the explor- 
er shaped his course to the rocks and glaciers of the Alaskan coast. He had 
determined to begin his season's work at the sixtieth parallel, and working 
southward complete his survey of the whole northwest coast at Cape Deci- 
sion, the point from which he had sailed last year. He reached the opening 
which Captain Cook had supposed to be a river early in April. The weather, 
though very cold, was bright and the view of the surrounding region, com- 
prised of stupendous mountains whose rugged and romantic forms clothed 
in perpetual sheets of ice and snow, presented a prospect, though magnificent- 
ly grand, yet dreary, cold and inhospitable. Upon exploration it was found 
that the sheet of water was not a river, but an inlet. Here a Russian settle- 
ment was found. The immigrants had lived at this place five years and were 
on friendly terms with their Indian neighbors. Some weeks after Vancou- 
ver received his first news from home. He had passed Yakutat Bay when he 
met Captain Brown, who had last year come to his assistance when he was 
in danger of losing his vessel in a rocky channel. Captain Brown had in 
the meantime been in England and had brought out the momentous tidings 
of the French revolution, and of the war between France and England. Here 
Vancouver fell ill, but Whidby continued the task of exploration. He dis- 



84 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

covered the immense mountain of ice, which has since received the name of 
the Muir Glacier. There is now a bay at the foot of the mountain called 
Glacier Bay, but Whidby found no such inlet. His account agrees with the 
tradition of the Indians. Lynn Canal, so familiar as the entrance to the 
Yukon, was discovered by Whidby and received from Vancouver the name 
of his birthplace, Lynn, in Norfolk. The natives here were found to be a 
fierce, treacherous, warlike race, and Whidby had to use all his vigilance to 
escape their attacks. They had been supplied with arms by the Russian trad- 
ers of New Archangel, a proceeding which roused the indignation of Van- 
couver. The boats which had been sent out in different directions to com- 
plete the last section of the survey met in Frederick Sound on the sixteenth 
of April, 1794, and on the nineteenth returned to the ships. The great work 
was finished, and Vancouver speaks of the fact in the following terms : 
" The accomplishment of an undertaking, the laborious nature of which can 
be easily perceived, and which had required their unwearied attention, abili- 
ties and exertions for three years to bring to a successful conclusion, could 
not fail of exciting in all on board the ' Discovery ' and ' Chatham ' sensa- 
tions of the most pleasing and satisfactory nature." 

On September second the ships arrived at Nootka and there Vancouver 
heard the sad intelligence of the death of his friend Quadra. At Monterey 
he had the satisfaction of learning that he was right in his interpretation of 
the treaty of Nootka, and that the whole port of Nootka harbor and Port 
Cox, with the adjacent country, would be delivered to Great Britain. A new 
commission had been issued from the court of London, but not addressed to 
Vancouver. He therefore set out on his homeward voyage. On their way 
home the ships captured a Dutch East Indiaman named the Malacca, as war 
had been declared with Holland. The "Discovery" and "Chatham" 
reached England in September, 1795, having been absent nearly five years. 
Before he had completed the preparation of his journals, Vancouver died, 
May 10, 1798, at the early age of forty. It is by the simple, unostentatious 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 35 

devotion to duty of such men as Vancouver that Eng-land has won her great - 
est victories whether in peace or war. He, in his Hfetime, had the satisfac- 
tion of knowing that he had done his work well, and posterity sees in the 
grand scenery of British Columbia, his monument. 

The commissioner appointed to succeed Vancouver was Lieutenant 
Thomas Pierce. On the twenty-eighth of March, 1795, he received from 
General Alva, the Spanish commissioner, the lands formerly occupied by 
the British, and the Spaniards having dismantled their fort Lieutenant Pierce 
hoisted the British flag in token of possession. Strange to say this harbor 
of Nootka Sound, the first point on the northwest coast to be brought to the 
notice of the world, and for ten years the resort of explorers and traders from 
all quarters, has not since the departure of the Spaniards been the home of 
civilized man. Even the natives have almost disappeared. Less than three 
hundred of the three thousand Indians with whom; Meares traded, survive 
to attend the little church which the zeal of the Roman Catholic missionary 
at Hesquiat has placed among them. At a small store in the cove, a successor 
of the old time traders strives to make gain of the Indians who, 
however, have long ago learned the true value of the white man's wares. 
Not a trace of the fortifications of either of the rival nations remains at 
Friendly Cove, and the visitor sees little in the village to tempt him to lingef 
in Nootka Sound.

CHAPTER IV. 
LAND EXPEDITIONS AND THEIR OUTCOME. 

After Vancouver there was a second lull in the interest attached to the 
fortunes of the Pacific Ocean. There were trading vessels from a number 
of countries, principally the United States and Great Britain, that came to 
traffic in the sea otter, which gradually became scarcer until they ceased to be 
profitable and sought for as formerly. After the Hudson's Bay Company 
had firmly established itself on the northwest coast, subsequent to the amal- 
gamation with the Northwest Company, in 182 1, the navigation of the north 
Pacific was practically limited for a number of years to their ships, and an 
occasional man of war. It will be permissible here to quote from the Year 
Book of British Columbia (1897), a summarized account of the conditions 
which prevailed after Vancouver took his departure for England, and it may 
be incidentally remarked the period immediately succeeding were dark days 
for not only England, but for all Europe. 

" As has already been stated, the Spaniards abandoned the country after 
the Nootka affair was terminated and never afterwards made any attempt 
at exploration or discovery in these waters. As a matter of fact. Great Brit- 
ain herself ceased to take any interest in it, and practically abandoned it as 
well. It is true the victory was with the British, but largely on account of 
the negative attitude of Spain, to which she was forced by her continental 
position; but the unsatisfactory terms of the settlement could hardly be re- 
garded a victory of diplomacy. They left wide open a ground of dispute, 
which was the cause of subsequent complications when the Oregt)n boundary 
came to be fixed. Notwithstanding that Spain took no direct part or interest 
in it, the United States government, claiming to inherit lier rights, did not 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 37 

fail to take advantage of the terms of the convention, which the great Fox 
at the time properly denounced as a blunder. 

" It is an interesting fact that the setlement of the Nootka affair left 
matters on this coast in a very uncertain, indefinable statu quo. For some 
years a long stretch of the Pacific territory was in reality " No Man's Land," 
and it is not in any sense due to the prescience or wisdom of British states- 
men of these days^ that it is British territory today. To the enterprise of the 
Northwest Company, and of its legitimate successor, the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany, is due any credit that may attach to an accomplishment we now ap- 
praise so highly. The traders of that powerful organization pushed their 
way through to the coast by way of New Caledonia and the southv,m passes 
of the Rocky Mountains, carrying with t lem the supremacy of the British 
flag and extending the authority of the Canadian laws, and finally occupied 
practically the whole of the Pacific Coast from Russian America to Mexico. 
That we do not occupy the whole of the Pacific slope today was no fault of 
theirs. However, in placing an estimate upon the statesmanship of Great 
Britain, which permitted by a policy of laissez-faire so much territory to slip 
through her hands, we must consider the circumstances and conditions of the 
the times, the remoteness of the country, the almost total lack of knowledge 
concerning it, and the general indifference which existed regarding its future. 
Men ofttimes are, but. cannot ordinarily be expected to be, wiser than they 
know. In view of all that has happened to, and in, the North American 
continent since that time, there is reason to be thankful that there has been 
left to us so glorious a heritage as we now possess. 

" Several fearful tragedies in which the Indians were concerned are 
recorded to have taken place on this coast when the fur trade was at the 
'height of prosperity. One was the destruction in 1803 of the American ship 
' Boston ' by the natives at Nootka Sound, all the crew being murdered with 
the exception of the armourer, Jewitt, and the sail-maker, Thompson, who 
were kept in slavery four years by the Chief Maquinna of Vancouver and 



38 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Quadra's Bay. In 1805 ^^e American ship 'Atahualpa,' of Rhode Island, 
was attacked by the savages of Millbank Sound and her captain, mate and 
six seamen were killed, after which the other seaman succeeded in repelling 
the assailants and saving the vessel. In the same manner the * Tonquin,' of 
Boston, was in June, 181 1, attacked by the natives whilst at anchor in Clayo- 
quot Sound, and nearly the whole crew murdered. Five of the survivors 
managed to reach the cabin, and from that vantage ground drove the savages 
from the vessel. During the night four of these men left the ship in a boat, 
and were ultimately murdered by the Indians. The day after the attack on 
the vessel, all being quiet on board, the savages crowded the decks for the 
purpose of pillage, when the ship suddenly blew up, causing death and de- . 
struction to all on board. About one hundred natives were killed by the ex- 
plosion, and this tragic ending has always been ascribed to the members of 
the crew secreted below." 

Alexander Mackenzie. 

While Vancouver was seeking in vain to find a waterway through the 
North American continent, a man of kindred spirit was, with no less persever- 
ance and with perhaps greater difficulty, making his way from the great 
plains of the Northwest over the rocky region that divides them from the 
Pacific Ocean. 

Towards the end of the eighteenth century Alexander Mackenzie was a 
partner in the Northwest Company, which was at that time striving to wrest 
from the Hudson's Bay Company the monopoly of the fur trade in the im- 
mense region to the north and west of Canada that it had held for more than a 
hundred years. The Northwest Company was founded in Montreal in 1783 
and consisted chiefly of Scotchmen who had made Canada their home. Among 
these was Alexander Mackenzie, one of the Mackenzies of Seaforth in Storna- 
wery, Island of Lewis. Having proved himself brave and enterprising, Mac- 
kenzie was sent to one of the company's outposts, Fort Chippewayan on Atha- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 39 

basca Lake. In the year 1789 he discovered the great river which bears his 
name and followed its course to the Arctic Ocean. Not seeing how it was 
possible to reach the Pacific from the ice-bound region which he was the first 
civilized man to behold, Mackenzie determined to find a western road to its 
shores. Accordingly, having prepared for the task he had set himself by 
going to England and studying astronomy and the use of instruments, Mac- 
kenzie set out from Chippewayan on October 10, 1792. He took the western 
branch of the Peace River, and at a place a short distance from the Forks he 
made his winter home. Two men had been sent forward during the summer 
to prepare timber, so Mackenzie was able to proceed rapidly with the work of 
building a trading post. The winter was unusually cold, though not un- 
pleasant. Tliere were Indians in the neighborhood who had previously given 
the fur traders some trouble. Mackenzie called them together and repri- 
manded themi for their bad conduct, at the same time giving them presents 
and showing them the benefits to be got by treating the white men well. 
Both among the Peace River and the Rocky Mountain Indians the women 
were greatly inferior to the men in personal appearance. Yet, though they 
were kept in a state of abject slavery, they were not without influence in the 
councils of the tribe. There was much sickness among these natives and 
Mackenzie was often called upon tO' play the part of physician and surgeon, 
which he did with great humanity and no little skill. The explorer speaks of 
the warm southwest winds since called the Chinook winds, which moderate 
the climate on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. 

On the 9th of May the river was clear of ice and the exploring party in 
a light but very heavily laden canoe. It consisted of Mackenzie himself and 
his lieutenant, Alexander MacKay, six French Canadians, two Indian hunters, 
and an interpreter. With infinite toil these hardy boatmen forced their way 
against the current of the Peace river. Many times they were obliged to 
unload their canoe and carry boat and cargo along the steep wooded banks of 
the river. Often their frail bark was caught in the rapids and dashed against 



40 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the rocks. Sometimes they drew it along by lines fastened to trees on the 
impending- precipice, at others they guided its course by catching hold of over- 
hanging branches. Night frequently overtook them where there was not a 
landing place large enough to afford a resting place for their exhausted 
frames. But a life of privation and hardship was the lot of these voyageurs, 
and a big camp fire, a comfortable meal and a glass of rum rarely failed to 
restore their good-humor and make them forget their fatigue. 

By the end of May they found that the river again divided and they took 
the southern branch. Mackenzie tells us that wild parsnips abounded here, 
and that their tops made a pleasant and refreshing addition to the diet of the 
explorers. In this vicinity Indians were met who, though at first terrified by 
a party of white men, were reassured by the fearless yet kind demeanor of 
their leader. They told him that there were Indians eleven days' march away 
who traveled a moon to another nation who live in houses. These people 
extended their journey to the seacoast and traded with white men who came in 
vessels as big as islands. Mackenzie could not, however, obtain any informa- 
tion concerning the river which he sought, but one of the young men con- 
sented to accompany the party as a guide. 

On the 9th of June the explorers entered a lake two miles long by five 
hundred yards wide which Mackenzie believed to be the source of the Peace 
River. Beyond this lake was a swampy region where the streams were en- 
cumbered with falling trees. Here their progress was slow. Mackenzie, 
seeing that unless provision were made for the homeward journey the party 
would be in danger of starvation, buried pemmican of the 21st of June. 
Making their way as best they could from one stream to another, the ex- 
plorers at last found they had a river whose current was carrying them on- 
wards. The banks soon grew steep and the rapids frequent. The men were 
in peril of their lives, and their canoe was continually being pierced by the 
jagged rocks. 

A large party of Indians and their families came up the river in canoes. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 41 

They at first showed signs of hostihty, but, as before, Mackenzie was able 
to induce some of them to enter into conversation with him and to obtain 
guides. He learned that the river ran south, its banks were steep, its current 
rapid and dangerous and the natives fierce. A few days later he .was able to 
get from a native of another party a plan of the river which he supposed to 
be the Columbia. This Indian told Mackenzie that there was a well-beaten 
path which led to the coast, but that the strangers had passed the opening into 
it some days ago. The story of the dangers of the route was repeated, and 
at last Mackenzie became convinced that it would be useless, even if it were 
practicable to go any further down the river. The place where Mackenzie 
came to this resolution was on the Fraser River near the mouth of the 
Quesnel. He procured material for a new canoe and again began rowing 
against the current. On the ist of July he put his men on short allowance, 
and on the 4th, having reached the west road, he hung up his canoe, made a 
cache where another portion of their scant provisions was left behind. 

As was very natural, the hardships and uncertainties of the journey and 
the determination to leave the river and adopt with unreliable guides an un- 
known route overland, occasioned great dissatisfaction among Mackenzie's 
men. When, however, they saw that their leader's resolution was unalter- 
able, and that if they abandoned him he would proceed alone, they determined 
to accompany him. On this as other occasions, Mackenzie owed much to his 
friend MacKay. The party then set out, each man carrying a heavy burden. 
The road seems to have been a well beaten one and several parties of Indians 
were met with. At the first of these encampments they noticed in the ears 
of one of the children two coins, one English and the other of Massachusetts 
Bay, bearing the date of 1787. 

On the loth of July the explorers reached an Indian village near which 
was a burial place. Here they were kindly treated. A few days later they 
met a party of Northern Indians. Here for the first Mackenzie speaks of 
the women as taking great pains with their personal appearance. The men, 



42 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

too, were tall and well dressed. The eyes of these people were gray, with a 
tinge of red, and their complexion fairer than that of any natives he had seen. 

Soon after this the explorers reached a mountainous region. Having 
climbed over a ridge they arrived at a place where there is a confluence of 
two rivers crossed by one to the left. Here the weary, half-starved travelers 
were hospitably entertained at a large village inhabited by a tribe of fisher- 
men, whose skill in taking and curing salmon excited their admiration. They 
procured a canoe at this place and proceeded down the river now known as 
the Bella Coola. They next stopped at a village where the women were 
employed in manufacturing cloth from the inner bark of the cedar tree. Here 
also they were kindly treated. As they neared the sea the natives seemed 
to be less prosperous. On the 20th of June Mackenzie reached the mouth of 
the Bella Coola, which empties not intO' the open ocean, but into one of the 
numerous channels which pierce the coast of British Columbia. Not satisfied 
with meeting the water, Mackenzie proceeded down Labouchere Channel 
towards the sea. Here for the first time the explorers were in great peril of 
destruction from a band of hostile natives. The most troublesome of them 
declared he had been ill-treated by white men whom he called Macubah and 
Bensins. When Mackenzie afterwards learned that Vancouver had explored 
Burke Channel that season, he interpreted these names as Vancouver and 
Johnstone. The party was forced to take refuge for the night on a rocky 
island and in the morning Mackenzie painted in melted grease and vermilion 
on the face of the rock the words : 

" Alexander Mackenzie, From Canada by Land, The Twenty Second of 
July, One Thousand, Seven Hundred and Ninety Three." 

The place where Mackenzie's journey ended was in latitude 52° 20' 48" 
N. A few hours afterwards the great explorer had good reason to fear that 
this brief record of his journey would be the only one made, for they again 
encountered the savages in greatly increased numbers, and the little band of 
almost expended travelers seemed doomed to destruction. Mackenzie, how- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 43 

ever, was able not only to repulse them, but to force them to restore some 
articles they had carried off the previous day. He lived to return to his 
native land, and to receive from the King of England the honor of Knight- 
hood, an honor seldom won, even in the brave days of old, by a more gallant 
or a more blameless knight. 

LEv^^Is AND Clark Expedition. 

When in 1803 Louisiana was purchased from France by the United 
States, the government determined to explore the new territory. President 
Jefferson accordingly planned an expedition for discovering the courses and 
sources of the Missouri, and the most convenient waterways to the Pacific 
Ocean. The leaders of the exploring party, which was splendidly equipped, 
were the president's secretary, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Both 
were captains in the United States army. Besides the captains there were 
forty-three persons. They set out in three boats heavily laden with stores, 
and materials for presents for the Indians. The party wintered at Wood 
River and on May 14, 1804, set out on their voyage up the Missouri. On the 
25th of the same month they passed the last white settlement on the river, a 
French village called La Charette. When they reached the mouth of the 
Osage River at the beginning of June, the Indians there refused to believe 
that Spain had parted with Louisiana. The explorers were, however, able 
to show the Indians that the government of the United States had really suc- 
ceeded to the power of Spain. On the 12th of June a party of Sioux came 
down the river, and the explorers were fortunate enough to obtain as guide 
and interpreter a man named Durion, who had lived for twenty years among 
those formidable savages. 

In the Autumn Lewis and Qark arrived at the Mandan country, where 
they resolved to winter. These Indians, the most civilized of the North 
American - tribes, had long been friendly to the white men, and during their 
stay among them the explorers found them intelligent and friendly. Sev- 



44 . BRITISH COLUMBIA 

eral of the leading- men of the Northwest Company visited this place during 
the autumn and winter. Among them were McCracken, McKenzie. and 
Leroche. The last named trader offered to join the expedition, but his serv- 
ices were declined. 

At the beginning of April the expedition divided. Sixteen men were 
sent back to make a report to the government of what had been done, and 
thirty-two proceeded up the river. In the latter party was an Indian woman, 
the wife of Carbonneau, an interpreter. Her name was Sacajawea, or the 
Birdwoman. She had been captured from the Shoshones, a tribe living 
among the Rocky Mountains, and who proved a useful member of the party. 
On Sunday, May 26, Captain Lewis obtained his first view of the Rocky 
Mountains. Thus far the course of the explorers, though sometimes toilsome, 
had been neither dangerous nor uncertain. However, they found that one 
branch of the river tended north, while the other ran in a southerly direction. 
They could not ascertain which was the main river, and Captain Lewis went 
north into Maria's River to explore. When he became convinced that no 
river rising near the source of this stream could reach the western ocean he 
returned. At the junction of the rivers, in latitude 47° 25' 17.2" the ex- 
plorers lightened their load by leaving behind everything that they could 
spare. 

On the 1 2th of June they reached the falls of the Missouri. Here expe- 
ditions set out in different directions to seek for the best route. There was 
no want of adventure in this region. Bears were frequently met with and 
buffalo hunting praved dangerous sport. Waterfalls and precipices made 
travel either by boat or by foot hazardous. On the 29th of June Captain 
Lewis, Sacajawea with her child and husband were almost carried down the 
river by a cloud burst. After about a month's careful exploring- the junction 
of three streams was reached. These were called the Jefferson, Madison and 
Gallatin, Following the longest, the Jefferson, the party on the 12th of 
August reached the headwaters of the Missouri. Lewis writes of this dis- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 45 

covery, " At the distance of four miles further the road took us to the most 
distant fountain of water, the mighty Missouri, in search of which we have 
spent so many toilsome days and restless nights. Thus far I had accomplished 
one of those great objects on which my mind had been unalterably fixed for 
many years; judge then of the pleasure I felt in allaying my thirst with this 
pure, ice-cold water which issues from the base of a low mountain or hill of 
a gentle ascent for half a mile. The mountains are high on either hand, but 
leave this gap at the head of this rivulet through which the road passes. Here 
I halted a few minutes and rested myself. Two miles below, McNeal had 
exultingly stood with one foot on each side of this little rivulet and thanked 
his God that he had lived to bestride the mighty and hitherto deemed endless 
Missouri." 

They climbed a mountain ridge and, looking around them, saw the snow- 
covered mountains which now form the boundary line between Montana and 
Idaho. " They followed a descent much steeper than that on the eastern side, 
and at a distance of the three-quarters of a mile reached a handsome, bold creek 
of cold, clear water, running to the westward. They stopped to taste for the 
first time the waters of the Columbia, and after a few minutes followed the 
road across steep hills and low hollows till they reached a spring on the side 
of a mountain." 

The first part of the commission of the explorers had now been accom- 
plished, but the most difficult task was still before them. As they searched 
for some path by which they could reach the navigable part of the river they 
met a band of Shoshone Indians. Among them Sacajawea recognized a 
dear friend who had been a fellow prisoner, and who greeted her very affec- 
tionately. The chief of the tribe proved to be her brother. Lewis and Clark 
smoked the pipe of peace with these Indians and gave the chiefs medals bear- 
ing the image of Washington. To the people many presents were given. 
The Shoshone Indians have a curious custom of removing their shoes before 
beginning their council, and they insisted upon the white men following their 



46 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

example. Food was given the travelers, and to their surprise and delight one 
of the dishes was a fresh salmon. They received this as evidence that they 
could not be far from a river by which they could reach the ocean. They 
were able to procure horses with which they were to proceed on their journey. 
On August 1 8 Captain Lewis kept his thirty-first birthday. On this oc- 
casion he tells us he was resolved " to live in future for mankind as I have 
formerly lived for myself," a resolution which one would think it was not 
necessary for a young man to make who had spent " toilsome days and rest- 
less nights " in order to bring an unknown region to the knowledge of civ- 
ilized man. On the 21st of August Captain Clark discovered salmon weirs 
on the bank of a river and named the stream after his brother explorer, the 
Lewis River. The country was terribly rough and there was no game to be 
seen. The Indians whom they met used sunflower seeds and the roots of a 
plant called " yamp " to eke out their slender store of food. Towards the end 
of August the Shoshone Indians who had accompanied them on their journey 
wished to leave them and join the hunting parties that were going to the 
plains to hunt buffalo on the banks of the Missouri. Captain Lewis was, 
however, able to persuade them to remain with him some time longer. The 
difficulty of getting enough horses for so large a party retarded their progress. 
At the beginning of September the explorers fell in with a party of Indians 
called Citashoots, who spoke a language quite different from any he had yet 
heard. It was full of strange guttural sounds, which Lewis compares to the 
clucking of a hen. The Indians were well mounted, but had very little food. 
As the season advanced a fall of snow added to the difficulties of their route 
and increased the scarcity of game. On the i6th of September they were 
reduced to the necessity of killing one of their colts for food, and they gave 
the place the name of Hungry Creek. 

The river had become broader and they determined to make canoes in 
which to descend to the mouth of the Columbia. They had met a party of 
the Perce-nez, or, as Lewis calls them, the Pierced Nose Indians. Their 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 47 

chief, who was styled Twisted-Hair, drew a plan of the river below on a 
piece of white elk-skin. From these people the half-famished party were able 
to procure supplies of kamas root, buffalo and dried salmon. The unaccus- 
tomed plenty made many of the men very ill, but by the 5th of October the 
canoes were finished and they were able to proceed. On the tenth day they 
were told by an Indian whom they met that he had seen white men at the falls 
of the Columbia. They reached the Snake River, but were forced to buy 
from Chopunnish or Pierced Nose Indians some of their dogs for food. The 
men of these people are described as stout, portly, well-looking men. The 
women are small, good-looking features, generally handsome, and their dress 
more modest than any hitherto observed. They spend their summers in fish- 
ing and collecting roots, the autumn in hunting roots and the spring in trad- 
ing for buffalo with the Indians of the plains. Unlike the hospitable Sho- 
shones, they were selfish and avaricious. As they proceeded they met other 
Indians who' used vapour baths, which Lewis describes, and on the 17th of 
October the explorers arrived at the confluence of the Snake or Lewis River 
with the Columbia. Here they met a band of Sokulk Indians, the first of 
the natives who followed the curious custom of flattening their heads. These 
people were very unprepossessing in appearance and in habits. They made 
their houses of mats and rushes. The men were more industrious than is 
usual among these savages, and great respect was paid to old age. On the 
19th of October Lewis discerned Mount St. Helens and recognized it by 
Vancouver's description. About this time the travelers observed a great 
burial vault sixty feet long by twelve feet wide. The bodies of those who 
had recently died were carefully wrapped in robes of skin, but the place con- 
tained heaps of bones of people who had died long ago. The remains of ani- 
mals and various domestic utensils which had been left for the use of the 
departed spirits were scattered about. On the 22nd of October the expedi- 
tion reached the mouth of the Deschutes River. The population of the banks 
of the Columbia River must at the beginning of the nineteenth century have 



48 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

been quite numerous, for few days passed without meeting" parties of natives 
or passing their villages. At one of the latter Lewis took note of the Indian 
method of curing" salmon. The fish were dried on scaffolds, then pounded 
and placed in baskets made of grass and rushes. Tliese receptacles were two 
feet long- by one in diameter. They were lined with salmon skin and pounded 
fish pressed so closely together that the contents of each weighed from ninety 
to one hundred pounds. Preserved in this way, the salmon remained fresh 
for years. It was an article of commerce as well as a provision against future 
want, and the Indians were very chary of parting with it. Ever since reach- 
ing the source of the Columbia game had been growing scarcer, but as the 
explorers neared the falls of the Columbia, in latitude 45° 42' 57" the country 
became more fertile and gfame more plentiful. Here the Indians built their 
houses of wood. Lewis was able to perform the office of peacemaker near 
the falls between a tribe of Indians called the Escheloots and the tribes above, 
with whom they had been at enmity. This was done through some of the 
chiefs of the Upper Columbia tribes who had accompanied the expedition 
thus far. Towards the end of October large numbers of sea otter were ob- 
served, though not many of them were killed. Mount Hood was recognized 
by Captain Lewis and it continued in sight for many days. The Indians 
below the falls spoke a fully different language from those above. A party 
met with on the 28th of October displayed a musket, cutlasses, several brass 
kettles and other articles obtained from the traders. Their chief showed with 
great pride a medicine bag filled with fingers of his enemies. Shortly after 
passing the Klikitat River an island was seen which contained an ancient 
burial-place. This was called by the natives " The Land of the Dead." On 
the first of November the traveler avoided a long rapid and shoot by making 
a portage, and soon after reached the tide water in latitude 45° 45' 45". 
Three days later an Indian village containing two hundred people of Skilkoot 
nation was reached. The houses were built of bark and thatched with straw. 
The natives were impudent and dishonest. They had had much intercourse 



BRITISH COLUMBIA • 49 

with the white traders. One of the canoes met with in this vicinity bore on 
its prow a full-sized image of a white man and a bear. On the 6th of No- 
vember it was observed that the Coast Mountains crossed the river. Near 
the mouth of the Cowlitz some canoe loads of Indians were met. Their leader 
could speak a few words of English, and informed the explorers that he had 
traded with a Mr. Haley. The next village was formed of houses built en- 
tirely above ground and belonged to a tribe calling themselves Wakkiacum. 
The dress of the women is thus described : " They wore a robe not reaching 
lower than the hip, added to this was a sort of petticoat or rather tissue of 
white cedar bark, bruised or broken into small strands and woven into a 
girdle by several cords of the same material." 

On the 7th of November the billows of the Pacific were seen, and for 
more than a week the boats endeavored, in spite of rain and wind, to reach 
the shore of the ocean. This they accomplished on the i8th of November, 
when they passed Cape Disappointment. Before this they had met two chiefs 
of the Chinook nation, Concommoly and Chillahlawil. Having made their 
way across the mouth of the river, they made acquaintance with the Chilts 
and Clatsops. Clark printed in beautiful characters on a tree the following 
inscription: "William Clark. Dec. 3rd, 1805. By land from the United 
States in 1804 and 1805." 

Here Lewis and Clark resolved to winter, and proceeded to build Fort 
Clatsop, which was finished on the 30th of December. The Indians, who 
had become familiar and intrusive, were now warned that the gates of the 
stockade would be closed at dark, and that from that time till morning the 
white men wished to be alone. Here we will take our leave of the explorers, 
who spent the third winter of their voluntary exile on the shores of the Pacific 
they had striven so hard to reach. 

This imperfect sketch gives but little idea of the toils and privations of 
the noble band of brave men who first explored the grand rivers which water 
so large a part of the territory of the United States. Still less does it do 



50 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

justice to their careful observation and diligent research. When the journals 
of Lewis and Clark were made public the reader learned the quality of the 
soil, the nature of the vegetation, the various kinds of wild animals and the 
characteristics of the many tribes of natives to be met with between the con- 
fines of civilization and the Pacific Ocean. By the aid of the maps and the 
descriptions of the explorers, the traveler could identify every bend in the 
river and ascertain the position of every island and mountain range along 
the route followed by them.

CHAPTER V. 

INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS. 

The Oregon Question. 

Very soon after the return of Lewis and Clark a merchant whose name 
is still a synonym for boundless wealth formed the Pacific Coast Fur Com- 
pany to establish the fur trade on the Pacific Coast. John Jacob Astor was 
a German by birth, who had made his home in New York and had prospered 
greatly. He had for many years been engaged in commerce on the Pacific 
Coast and with China, and in trade with the Indians in the center of the 
American continent. He now determined to obtain control of the whole fur 
trade of the unsettled parts of the United States and of the Russian establish- 
ment in North America. He intended to establish trading posts on the 
Missouri, the Columbia and the coasts contiguous to that river. By export- 
ing the furs gathered in America to China and exchanging them for the 
products of the east, he hoped to extend the commerce of the Pacific Fur 
Company around the world. Astor tried to avoid the danger of the competi- 
tion of the Northwest Company by inviting it to share his enterprise, an offer 
which that powerful and energetic body declined. He was, however, able to 
enlist several individual members of the company as partners and to engage a 
number of its old employes. A ship was sent out tO' view the coast and agents 
were sent to St. Petersburg to conclude an arrangement with the Russian 
Fur Company by which that body would sell its fur to the Astor Fur Com- 
pany and obtain supplies of food and merchandise at the station to be estab- 
lished at the mouth of the Columbia. These preliminaries concluded, an 
expedition was sent out in 1810 on board the good ship Tonquin, Captain 



62 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Thorn master, to build the fort and establish the fnr trade. It called at the 
Hawaiian Islands for fresh supplies, and on the T2th of April, t8ii, beg-an to 
build a fort at Point Georg-e, on the south side of the Columbia, about twelve 
miles from its mouth. The fort was called after the founder of the enter- 
prise. Astoria. As soon as the work was well under way Captain Thorn 
departed on the Tonquin on a trading cruise to the west coast of Vancouver 
Island. Neither the ship nor captain ever returned. The captain and most 
of the crew were massacred by the Indians in return for an insult which 
Thorn had put upon one of the chiefs. The ship itself was blown up, whether 
by accident or desigji could never be learned. The survivor of the crew of 
the Tonquin was an interpreter, who surrendered himself as a slave to the 
women who accompanied in their canoes the infuriated savages. On the 
T5th of July, before the fort was completed, a boat came down the Columbia 
bearing a party of the Northwest Company's men whose leader, David 
Thompson, had been for years exploring the region in which the northern 
waters of the Columbia had their source, and who had hoped to be the first 
to reach the Pacific and build a trading post at the mouth of the river of which 
he believed himself to be the discoverer, and had hoped to be the first to ex- 
plore. McDougall, the commander of the Fort Astoria, treated his visitor 
with the greatest courtesy, and after a few days Thompson departed for 
Montreal accompanied by Stuart, who was in charge of an expedition to build 
a trading post in the interior. The place chosen by Stuart for the fort was 
on Okanagan River; the Northwest Company had already reached the Spo- 
kane. A few months later Qarke, of the Pacific Fur Company, planted an- 
other establishment on the latter river. On the i8th of January, 1812, an 
overland expedition in charge of Hunt, chief manager of the Pacific Fur 
Company, arrived at Astoria after having suffered many hardships and losses. 
When Astor heard of the loss of the Tonquin he sent a ship, namely, 
the Beaver, to Astoria with supplies and merchandise to trade with the Rus- 
sians for furs. In August Hunt proceeded up the coast in the Beaver to 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 53 

conclude some arrangements begun in St. Petersburg some time before by 
which the Pacific Coast Fur Company would buy all the furs of the Russia 
Company and supply them with all necessaries for their trade with the na- 
tives. Having satisfactorily fulfilled his mission Hunt sailed for the Sand- 
wich Islands, but it was six months before he could find a vessel to bring him' 
to Astoria. During his absence the Northwest Company had established 
many trading ports on the Upper Columbia and its branches. The war of 
1812 had broken out and the partners of the Pacific Fur Company having 
no ship and small means of defense were becoming anxious for the safety of 
their position. On the nth of April, 1813, Astoria was visited by John 
George McTavish and Joseph Leroche with a large party of nor'westers. 
The Northwest Company wanted to purchase Astoria and McTavish had 
come to show the partners there the danger of their position, the unlikeli- 
hood of their receiving supplies now that British cruisers were sailing the 
position and the wisdom of selling their post before it would be captured. 
McDougall and his associates were not easily persuaded. At last they agreed 
that if during the year supplies did not arrive arid if the war was not over, 
they would disband and having sold the post at a good price hand the money 
over to Astor, When Hunt returned shortly after the departure of Mc- 
Tavish he was sadly disappointed at the position of affairs, but could propose 
no better plan. In October of the same year McTavish came back, this time 
accompanied by Alexander Stewart, and the purchase of Astoria was con- 
cluded, the price being $80,500. Two weeks after H. M. S. Raccoon arrived 
and great was the disappointment of her officers to find that the Northwest 
Company by purchasing the trading-post had deprived them of a rich and 
easily obtained prize. The captain changed the name of the place to Fort 
George and took possession of the place in the name of Great Britain. In 
1814 the treaty of Ghent was signed and by one of its clauses all territory, 
places and possessions taken during the war, with the exception of certain 
islands in the Bay of Fundy were to be restored. It was the 9th of August, 



54 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

1818, before the British authorities finally restored Fort George in the fol- 
lowing formula: 

" We, the undersigned, do in conformity to the first article of the treaty 
of Ghent, restore to the government of the United States the settlement of 
Fort George on the Columbia River." 

No attempt was made by the United States for several years after the 
sale of Astoria to settle or establish trading posts in what came to be known 
as the Oregon Country. In 18 19 Long's expedition, of which an account 
was published in 1823, ascertained that the whole division of North America 
drained by Missouri and Arkansas and their tributaries between the meridian 
of the mouth of the Platte and the Rocky Mountains is a desert. The North- 
west Company carried on their trade from Fort George at the mouth of the 
Columbia to Fort St. James near the head waters of the Fraser without a 
rival. By a convention made in 18 18 between Great Britain and the United 
States it was agreed that the country westward of the Rocky Mountains 
should be free and open for ten years from the date of the convention, to the 
vessels, citizens, and subjects of both powers, without prejudice to the 
claims of either country. In the year 1821 the Hudson's Bay Company and 
the Northwest Company united and the courts of judicature of Upper Canada 
were empowered to take cognizance of all causes, civil or criminal, in the 
Hudson's Bay Territories or other ports not within the limits of Upper 
Canada, Lower Canada, or the United States. Tliis company received a 
license to trade in the regions which had not originally formed part of Ru- 
pert's land for a period not exceeding 21 years, and persons in the service 
might act as justices of the peace. The Hudson's Bay Company being now 
a very powerful organization extended their fur trade along the coast to 
the borders of Alaska and increased and improved their establishments in 
the interior. Peace and good order were the rule wherever the company's 
authority reached. • The manager of their affairs on the Pacific Coast was 
John McLoughlin, a man eminently fitted for his position. He moved from 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 5§ 

Fort George and built Fort Vancouver on the north bank of the Columbia 
near the mouth of the Willamette. Large farms were cultivated at Van- 
couver and at other places in the Columbia valley and on Puget Sound. 

While the dispute about the ownership of the Northwest coast was aris- 
ing between England and the United States, a third claim was made. The 
Russian emperor issued a ukase claiming the ownership of the whole west 
coast of America north of the fifty-first parallel and of the east coast of Asia 
north of forty-five degrees forty-five minutes north latitude and forbidding 
foreigners to come within one hundred miles of the coast. Both England and 
the United States protested against this extravagant assumption on the part 
of Russia and a treaty was made by each of them. That with the United 
States was concluded first in 1824. By this treaty it was agreed that the 
subjects of both nations should be free to navigate the waters of the Pacific 
Ocean or to resort to its coasts to trade with the natives, though United 
States citizens must not resort to any points where there is a Russian estab- 
lishment nor found establishments north of fifty-four degrees forty minutes. 
The subjects of either nation could frequent interior seas, gulfs, harbors ana 
creeks for the purposes of fishing and trading with the natives. 

An important provision of the treaty of 1825 made with Great Britain 
provides that : " the line of demarcation between possessions of the high con- 
tracting parties upon the coast of the continent and the islands of America 
to the northwest shall be drawn from the southern most point of Prince of 
Wales Island, eastward to the great inlet in the continent called Portland 
Channel and along the middle of that inlet to the fifty-sixth degree of lati- 
tude, whence it shall follow the summit of the mountains bordering the coast 
within ten leagues northwestward to Mount St. Elias and thence north in the 
course of the twenty-first meridian from Greenwich, which line shall form the 
limit between the Russian and British possessions in the continent of America 
to the Northward." This clause of the treaty plainly acknowledged the Rus- 



66 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

sian belief in the right of Great Britain tO' possessions on the northwest coast 
of America. 

As the time of the expiration of the convention of 1818 drew near there 
was a strong- feeHng both in England- and the United States that the bound- 
ary between their possessions should be determined, and plenipotentiaries 
were appointed. England proposed that the southern boundary of her pos- 
sessions should be the forty-ninth parallel to the northeasternmost branch of 
the Columbia River, thence down the middle of the stream to the Pacific. 
The utmost that the United States would concede was that the forty-ninth 
parallel should be the boundary line to the Ocean. As neither side would 
yield on the sixth of August, 1827, it was resolved " that the provisions of 
October 20th, 18 18, rendering all territories claimed by Great Britain or by 
the United States west of the Rock Mountains free and open to the citizens 
or subjects of both nations for ten years should be extended for an indefinite 
period, and that either party could annul or abrogate the convention by giv- 
ing a year's notice." 

So far the only settlers in Oregon had been fur traders, but from this 
time immigrants from the United States began to arrive in very small num- 
bers at first, but gradually increasing till about the year 1842 it was felt that 
joint occupation was no longer practicable. In that year the Northeastern 
boundary of the United States was fixed by the Ashburton Treaty, but the 
contracting powers did not consider it wise to complicate the situation by 
introducing into the negotiations the Oregon Question. 

There was a party from the United States who claimed the whole region 
west of the Rocky Mountains from the forty-second parallel of north latitude 
to that of fifty-four degrees forty minutes, that is, from California to Alaska. 
Some of its members asserted their determination to take up arms and drive 
Great Britain from the Pacific Slope. They rested their claim on right de- 
rived from the purchase of Louisianan in 1803 and on the Florida Treaty with 
Spain in 1819. When by the Treaty of Versailles the Independence of the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 57 

United States was acknowledg-ed the Mississippi formed its western borders. 
In 1803 the young Republic extended its borders by the purchase from France 
of Louisiana. Concerning the western boundary of this new acquisition 
Greenhow says : " In the absence of all light on the subject from histor)^ we 
are forced to regard the boundaries indicated by nature, namely the high- 
lands separating the headwaters of the Mississippi from those flowing into 
the Pacific or Californian Gulf, as the true western boundaries of Louisiana." 
By the Florida Treaty Spain ceded to the United States all rights, claims and 
pretentions to territories beyond Louisiana, which by the words of that Treaty 
reached on the north to latitude forty-two degrees, and on the west to the 
Pacific Ocean. Spain, these claimants contended, owned the Northwest 
Coast by virture of discovery, and that right she ceded by the treaty of 1819 
to the United States. The moderate party claimed the valley of the Colum- 
bia from Gray's discovery in 1792, the exploration of Lewis and Clark in 
1804-5, the settlement of Astoria and others made by the Pacific Fur Com- 
pany and on the ground of contiguity to what was their undisputed territory. 
The British on their part based their claims on the discovery of Cook, 
the Nootka Convention which gave them the right of settlement in what had 
previously been claimed as Spanish possessions, the explorations of Van- 
couver and the journeys and discoveries of Mackenzie, Fraser and Thomp- 
son. Their strongest argument, however, was that for nearly thirty-five 
years British subjects had been the chief occupants of the whole region and 
for the greater part of that time no United States subject had lived west of 
the Rocky Mountains. Many other matters were imported into the con- 
troversy between the nations, which grew more and more bitter as time went 
on. Negotiations having continued through the years 1844 and 1845 without 
result, and notice of the abrogation of the Convention by the Ignited States 
having been received in England, the British plenipotentiary was instructed 
to present to the United States government a new scheme for the settlement of 
the difiiculty. This was accepted and became in 1846 the Treaty of Oregon. 



68 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

By this treaty it was provided that the forty-ninth parallel should be the 
boundary between the United States and the British possessions to the middle 
of the channel that separates the continent from Vancouver Island; that the 
navigation of the Columbia should be free to British subjects; that the pos- 
sessory rights of all British subjects shall be respected and the farm lands 
and other property of the Puget Sound Agricultural Company should be con- 
firmed to it. There were many in Canada and in Great Britain who viewed 
the Oregon treaty as a weak concession to^ the claims of the United States, 
while on the other hand the extremists in the Republic believed that the 
Monroe Doctrine promulgated in 1818 should have been followed and " that 
the American continents by the free and independent condition which they 
have assumed and maintain are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for 
colonization by any European power." 

Simon Eraser. 

While Lewis and Clark were making their way down the Columbia the 
Northwest Company were preparing to occupy the Pacific Slope. In 1805 
Simon Eraser was at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, having received direc- 
tions to follow Mackenzie's route, establish the fur trade among the tribes 
near the headwaters of the Peace, and the yet unnamed river discovered by 
the great explorer, and to follow, if possible, that river to its mouth and find 
out whether or not it was the Columbia. About the same time David Thomp- 
son received instructions to find a pass further to the south and seek in that 
direction the headwaters of the Columbia. As we have seen that members 
of the Northwest Company met Lewis and Clark in the Mandan country 
the previous year, it is possible that news of the United States expedition 
had reached the headquarters of that enterprising body and stimulated its 
efforts to prevent the trade of the great unexplored region to the west from 
falling into the hands of the shrewd citizens of the young republic. 

The only explorations of which we have any record during the twelve 



BRITISH COLUMBIA . 59 

years since Mackenzie crossed the Pacific Slope is that of James Finlay, who 
in 1797 ascended the Finlay River, the northern branch of the Peace River. 
The first building' erected by a white man west of the Rocky Mountains 
was Fort McLeod, built on McLeod Lake by James McDougall. No one 
since 1793 had ventured to launch a boat on the terrible river, whose dangers 
even the intrepid Mackenzie had feared to brave. The man to whom the 
arduous task of exploring it was one of the youngest of the partners of the 
Northwest Company. Simon Fraser was the son of a Loyalist, who served 
under Burgoyne and who died not long after the surrender of the army of 
that ill-fated general. His widow with her child removed to Cornwall, Up- 
per Canada, and when her boy was sixteen years old he received a position 
in the Northwest Company. Being hardy and adventurous as well as indus- 
trious the boy succeeded and by the time he was twenty-six years old had 
become one of the advance guard of the Northwest Company. Leaving 
Fort Dunvegan on the Peace River in the autumn of 1805 he made his way 
to the Rock Mountain portage where he with fourteen of his men spent the 
winter. From Rocky Mountain House he proceeded by the Peace River to 
the Pacific Slope, finding as Mackenzie had done, great difficulty in passing 
from the headwaters of the Parsnip to those of the Fraser. In this region 
of lakes and mountains Fraser remained building forts and establishing the 
fur trade for more than two years. It was he who, recalling his mother's 
stories of her childhood's home, first gave this rugged land the appropriate 
name of New Caledonia. In a beautiful situation on Stuart Lake in 1806, 
Fraser built Fort St. James, which has been ever since the principal depot of 
the fur trade of northern British Columbia. The lake was called after John 
Stuart, a clerk of the Northwest Company and Fraser's friend and lieutenant. 
At the confluence of the Fraser and Nechaco the explorers met a band of In- 
dians to whom tobacco and soap were alike unknown luxuries. Proceeding 
up the Nechaco, Stuart discovered a lake which from its position he consid- 
ered would make a good trading center. He gave it the name of his leader 



60 • BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and Fort Fraser was built where the lake falls into the river. The following 
winter was passed at Stuart Lake. The difficulty of obtaining supplies in- 
•duced Fraser to send for more men. While he was awaiting their arrival 
he erected Fort George at the confluence of the Nechaco and the Fraser. 
The reinforcement arrived in 1807 in charge of Hugh Fairies and Maurice 
Quesnel, bringing rumors of Lewis and Qark and a request to hurry the 
expedition. 

On the 26th of May Fraser set out on his journey to the sea. Every 
hour of the long summer days, during which the explorers followed the wind- 
ings of the tumultuous river around towering mountains and over jagged 
rocks which tore its waters into foam, was full of peril. The coolness with 
which they overcame the boiling surges of the river and crept along its pre- 
cipitous banks, often making a foothold for themselves with their daggers, 
showed that these rugged fur traders were as fearless as the vikings of old. 
Their canoes were repeatedly broken, often destroyed. At length the at- 
tempt to navigate the river was abandoned and the party toiled over the 
mountains till at length the smoother current showed that they were nearing 
the sea. On the way down Fraser had observed and named the rivers Quesnel 
and Thompson, which contributed their waters to the volume of the river. 
Fraser reached the tide waters of the Pacific in the vicinity of the site of 
the city of New Westminster on the second day of July, 1808. He was pre- 
vented from proceeding to the ocean by the attacks of hostile Indians, but he 
had learned that the river he had been exploring was not the Columbia. 

David Thompson. 

The leader of the northern expedition of the Northwest Company was a 
remarkable man. David Thompson had in his youth received a good educa- 
tion, and having adopted the calling of a surveyor received a position in the 
Hudson's Bay Company. In 1795 he found a route from Hudson's Bay to 
Lake Athabasca. On his return he learned that his services were no longer 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 61 

needed and immediately set out for the headquarters of the Northwest Com- 
pany. He was immediately engaged and on August 9th, 1796, began a series 
of surveys lasting for many years, during which he traced the courses of the 
Saskachewan, the Assiniboine and most of the rivers between Lake Superior 
and the Rocky Mountains. He visited the Mandan country and sought and 
thought he had found the sources of the Mississippi. In his busy, though 
often lonely life, the explorer found time and opportunity to pursue the study 
of the heavens, and has been distinguished by the title of astronomer. 

In 1805 Thompson was commissioned to ascend the Saskachewan to 
explore the Columbia and examine the region between the mountains and 
the Pacific Ocean. 

During the five years from 1806 to 181 1 Thompson spent most of his 
time in southeastern British Columbia. He discovered the source of the 
Columbia and explored its northern waters. He followed the course of the 
Kootenay and finally reaching the Lower Columbia by way of the Spokane 
and Pend d'Oreille branches rowed down to its mouth, as has been before 
related, on the 15th of July, 181 1. He established the fur trade at points as 
far distant as the Bend of the Columbia, the Forks of the Thompson and the 
United States boundary line. The explorer made frequent journeys east- 
ward, and is said to have come through the wall of mountains by the Kicking 
Horse, the Yellowhead, Howe's and Athabasca passes. The importance of 
his labors can hardly be overestimated though they were very ill-requited. It 
is largely due to the achievement of these explorers and pioneers of the fur 
trade, Fraser and Thompson, that Great Britain owns the magnificent prov- 
ince of British Columbia. 

San Juan. 

When in 1846 the Oregon Treaty was signed it was believed that the 
question of the northern limits of the territory of the United States was set- 
tled at once and forever ; yet the ink was hardly dry on the paper when events 



62 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

took place which at an earlier period would have ended in a fratricidal war. 

Seven miles to the southeast of Victoria, now the capital of British 
Columbia, at the time of the signing- of the treaty a Hudson's Bay Company 
trading post, lies the island of San Juan, the largest of the Haro Archipelago. 
About the time of the founding of Fort Camosun, when the Hudson's Bay 
Company were seeking new pastures for their flocks and herds at a distance 
from those of the settlers in Oregon, they sent a number of sheep and cattle in 
charge of some of their servants to the island of San Juan. These throve so 
well that when disputes arose as to the ownership of the place they had five 
thousand sheep and a great number of cattle, pigs and horses. In 185 1 W. 
J. McDonald, one of the Hudson's Bay Company's employes, established a 
salmon fishery at San Juan and warned the United States fishermen in the 
vicinity that they must not fish inshore as the island was British territory. 

On the other hand, the Legislature of Oregon in 1852 organized Whid- 
by Island and the Haro Archipelago into a district called Esland County. 
The next year Oregon was divided and the district placed under the juris- 
diction of Washington. In 1854 the collector of customs for Puget Sound, 
I. N. Ebey, came over to collect dues from the Hudson's Bay Company agent 
for pure bred stock which had been lately imported. The customs house 
officer met Charles John Griffen, a clerk of the company and justice of the 
peace for the colony of Vancouver Island, who asserted that San Juan was 
British territory and that no duties could be collected on behalf of the United 
States. When Governor Douglas heard of the matter he came over from 
Victoria in the steamer Otter, with Charles Sangster, collector of customs for 
that port. Sangster came on shore, declared the island British territory and 
hoisted the British flag. Ebey unfurled the United States revenue flag, swore 
in Henry Webber as a deputy and sailed away. Within the year, fear of 
the northern Indians caused Webber to leave the island. During this year 
an appraiser was sent over from Washington to assess the property of San 
Juan. As the Hudson's Bay Company refused to pay the assessment the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 63 

sheriff of Whatcom arrived and seized and sold at auction a number of the 
company's sheep. The protests against this action caused Governor Stephens 
to apprise the executive of the United States of what he had done. He was 
told to instruct the officials of the territory not to attempt to enforce the pay- 
ment of any taxes on the island of San Juan as longf as there was any dispute 
as to its ownership. At the same time they were not to acknowledge that 
it was a British possession. Accordingly assessments continued to be made 
and imports valued as before though the officials sent to perform these serv- 
ices were frequently obliged to seek from the Hudson's Bay Company's men 
protection from the northern Indians, who were frequent and dangerous visit- 
ors. Affairs had reached this point when in 1856 a commission was ap- 
pointed to fix the boundary line laid down in the Treaty of Oregon in 1846. 
The commissioners were Captain Prevost and Captain Richards for the Brit- 
ish government and Archibald Campbell, with whom was associated Lieuten- 
ant Parke, for that of the United States. Expeditions were fitted out by both 
nations. That of the United States, the first to arrive, was on board the sur- 
veying ship " Active," and the brig "' Fauntleroy." Captain Prevost came out 
in H. M. S. " Satellite " in June, 1857, followed some months later by 
Captain Richards in H. M. S. " Plumper." 

There was no question as to the boundary between the British and 
United States possessions until the sea was reached. The position of the 
forty-ninth parallel was ascertained and monuments placed from the north 
shore of Semiahmoo Bay to the southeastern limit of East Kootenay. But 
as to the boundary through the water after it left the forty-ninth parallel there 
was an irreconcilable difference of opinion between the commissioners. The 
words of the Oregon Treaty which refer to this part of the boimdary are: 
" From the point on the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, where the 
boundary laid down by existing treaties and conventions between Great Brit- 
ain and the United States terminates, the line of the boundary between the 
territories of her Britannic Majesty and those of the United States shall be 



64 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

continued westward along the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude to the 
middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver Island 
and thence southerly through the middle of said channel, and of Fuca Strait 
to the Pacific Ocean, provided, however, that the navigation of the said 
channel and straits, south of the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, remain 
free and open to both parties." 

If there had been only one channel between Vancouver Island and the 
continent, there could have been no dispute, as the words of the treaty are 
very explicit. But the water immediately south of the forty-ninth parallel 
is divided by the Haro Archipelago, into three navigable channels. The 
largest of these, some seven miles wide, called the Canal de Haro, separates 
Vancouver Island from the Archipelago. Rosario Straits lies between Wash- 
ington and the islands of Orcas and Lopez. Through which of these chan- 
nels should the boundary run? The United States commissioners declared 
that the framers of the treaty had in mind the Canal de Haro, the widest 
channel and the one nearest Vancouver Island. The British commissioners 
contended quite as strongly that Rosario Strait fulfilled the conditions of 
the treaty and that moreover at the time it was drawn up, San Juan, the larg- 
est of the islands, belonged to Vancouver Island, the Hudson's Bay Company 
having occupied it since 1843. I" August, 1859, Lord John Russell, head of 
the foreign office, in a dispatch to Lord Lyons, the British minister at Wash- 
ington, proposed that rather than continue the irritating controversy the 
middle channel should be adopted as the one through the middle of which the 
boundary line should pass. This would give all the islands except San Juan 
to the United States. The compromise was not accepted and when, having 
thoroughly surveyed the three channels the commission found that they could 
come to no agreement, the matter was in 1867, ten years after they had begun 
their labors, referred to their respective governments. 

While surveyors and diplomatists were striving to arrive at a peaceful 
solution of the boundary question a trivial incident rendered its settlement 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 65 

still more difficult. A United States settler named Lyman A. Cutler, had 
gone in April, 1859, to live on San Juan Island, and planted a patch of po- 
tatoes near the Hudson's Bay Company's establishment. One of the Com- 
pany's hogs on the 15th of June had rooted up some of Cutler's potatoes and 
was shot by the angry farmer. The manager of the Company's farm de- 
manded a high price for the animal, which Cutler refused to pay. During 
the day it happened that three of the leading men of the company, Dallas, 
Tolmie and Fraser, came over to San Juan on the steamer " Beaver." Dallas 
on hearing of the occurrence insisted on the payment demanded and warned 
Cutler against any further injury to the company's property. High words 
and even threats were said to have passed between the two men. 

General Harney was at that time commander of the military department 
of Oregon. The American settlers, of whom there were about thirty, had in 
May asked the general to send them a guard of twenty soldiers to protect 
them from, the northern Indians. He did not comply with their request at 
the time, but on the 9th of July he visited the island. He was presented by 
Cutler and other settlers from the United States with a second i&gt;etition ask- 
ing for protection, not only from the Indians, but from the authorities on Van- 
couver Island, who they stated had threatened Cutler's arrest. General Har- 
ney W'ithout communicating with his superior officer or with the authorities 
at Washington, issued an order to Captain Pickett to transfer his company 
from Fort Bellingham to San Juan Island. On the day of the arrival of 
Pickett's deatchment (July 27th), Major de Courcy came over from Victoria 
on H. M. S. "Satellite " to fill under British law the office of Stipendiary 
Magistrate on the Island of San Juan. 

Captain Pickett proceeded to establish a military camp, and on the 31st 
was reinforced by another company under Colonel Casey from Steilacoom. 
There were then stationed at the island 461 United States soldiers, with eight 
32 pounders. 

It was September before the British minister in Washington learned that 



66 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the disputed territory had been occupied by United States soldiers. The am- 
bassador represented the matter to the president as Hkely to occasion a grave 
breach of the friendly relations between the two governments. The executive 
of the United States immediately sent General Scott to inquire into the cause 
of General Harney's action, and to make such arrangements as would tend 
to preserve peace between England and the United States. On his arrival at 
the Pacific Coast General Scott ordered the removal of all the cannon from 
San Juan and left but one company of soldiers there. As Pickett had ren- 
dered himself objectionable to the British residents of the island an officer 
named Hunt was put in his place. He urged upon Governor Douglas the ad- 
visability of sending an equal force to occupy the island on behalf of Great 
Britain. After some delay this plan was agreed to and on the 20th of March, 
t86o, a detachment of Marines under Captain George Bazalgette was sent to 
San Juan. This joint occupation continued for twelve years. The greatest 
harmony and good feeling prevailed between the military men stationed at 
San Juan and many pleasant social gatherings attended by the young people of 
Victoria and Esquimalt, took place on the island. That no collision took 
place while General Harney was placing the troops on San Juan was entirely 
owing to the wise forbearance of General Baynes, who would allow neither 
the provocation of his enemies nor the rashness of his friends to hurry into ill- 
considered action. This was the more to be commended as he had, by the 
admission of the American officers, a force amply sufficient to prevent the 
landing of the troops or to effect their capture afterwards. 

The San Juan difficulty still remained unsettled when in 1871 the Joint 
High Commission met at Washington. By one of the terms of the treaty 
then drawn up it was decreed that the matter of the disputed boundary should 
be submitted to the arbitration of the Emperor William of Germany, whose 
decision would be final. George Bancroft the American minister to Germany 
was appointed to prepare the case of the United States, while Mr. Petre the 
British charge d'affaires conducted that of Great Britain. The award was 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 67 

made in favor of the contention of the United States on October loth, 1872. 
By this time British Columbia had become a province of Canada, w^hose 
southern Hmit from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific was not completely de- 
fined. 

The Alaskan Boundary. 

To the modern tourist the name of Alaska suggests a scene of rugged 
grandeur whose chief features are high rocky islands, deep fiords and mighty 
mountains, whose immense glaciers glisten in the sunlight. The sea sheltered 
by rocks on either hand is peaceful and the only dangers to be feared are the 
sunken rock or the hidden iceberg. As he floats along during the endless 
midsummer days it requires an effort to remember that the ownership of these 
picturesque fiords and barren shores has been a subject of grave dispute be- 
tween two powerful nations. Yet a great deal of time and thought has been 
spent by some of the wisest men in England and the United States and much 
money has been expended in the effort to settle the Alaskan Boundary Ques- 
tion. All that can be done here is to give a brief outline of the history of the 
dispute and of the terms of settlement. 

The peninsula of Alaska was discovered in the year 1741 by Behring on 
his third voyage. Its shores were soon frequented by Russian fur traders, and 
in 1 789 the Russian American Fur Company was formed, and given exclusive 
privileges of trade in the whole of Alaska, which seems at that time to have 
been undefined territory. When at the end of the eighteenth and the be- 
ginning of the nineteenth century British explorers found their way either 
by land or sea to the territory to the south and east of her possessions, Rus- 
sia does not seem to have concerned herself much about their doings. It was 
another matter when fur traders began to occupy the country and to deplete 
the waters of the sea-otter and seal and the land of beaver, marten and other 
fur-bearing animals. The Russian monopolists viewed with great disfavor 
the neighborhood of the British monopolists. In 182 1, the year when the 
great fur companies united, the Russian emperor issued a ukase, claiming the 



68 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

whole west of America north of the fifty-first parallel of north latitude and 
forbidding* the subjects of any foreign nation to approach within one hundred 
miles of the coast. England hastened to protest against the extravagant 
claims, and in 1825 a treaty was made defining the boundary between the 
respective possessions of England and Russia in America. 

The Peninsula of Alaska was divided from' the British possessions to 
the east of it by the one hundred and forty-first degree of longitude, about 
which no dispute could arise. Russia, however, claimed a strip of seacoast 
reaching as far south as latitude fifty-four degrees forty minutes. Though the 
coast had been explored by Vancouver the land was untrodden by the foot 
of civilized man. It was traversed by mountains, crossed by rivers, and in- 
dented by many arms of the sea. An archipelago of islands stretched along 
its coast. The definition of the eastern boundary of this part of Alaska was 
laid down very elaborately by the negotiations. It was more than half a 
century before there was any necessity for ascertaining where this boundary 
lay and then many difficulties presented themselves as to the interpretation of 
the treaty. There was also a clause which gave British subjects " the right 
of navigating freely and without any hindrance whatever, all the rivers and 
streams which may cross the line of demarcation upon the line of coast de- 
scribed in article III of the present Convention." 

While the Russians held Alaska no dispute arose with regard to the pro- 
visions of the treaty. Between the years 1839 and 1849 ^he Hudson's Bay 
Company leased the Russian territory between latitudes fifty-four degrees 
forty minutes and 58 degrees North. 

In 1867 the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in the same 
year the Dominion of Canada was formed. When in 1871 British Columbia 
entered into confederation Alaska and Canada became adjoining territories. 
In that year the treaty of Washington was signed and it contained a clause 
Avhich was interpreted to mean that England gave up the right of her subject 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 69 

to navigate the rivers and streams of Alaska for any purpose save that of 
commerce. 

Gold was discovered in the Cassiar District of British Columbia in 1872. 
Tlie nearest route into the country was by the Stikine River, which was de- 
clared to run through the United States territory ; this caused an agitation 
for a definition of the boundary and surv^eyors went into the country to try 
to locate it, but little was done till in 1896 the great discovery of gold in the 
Klondike, a tributary of the Yukon situated in the northwest of Canada, 
showed still more plainly the dangers and inconveniences that might arise 
from an uncertain boundary. From every quarter men rushed to the gold- 
fields carrying with them valuable outfits. The most direct entrance was by 
Lynn Canal in Alaska. The- United States town of Skagway was on this 
canal, and Canada claimed, but was refused the right to build one near it. 
A provisional boundary was perforce agreed upon at this place. 

The Alaskan Boundary controversy must be allowed to exist no longer. 
All the points in dispute resolved themselves into one. To whom did the 
inlets belong? The treaty declared that the width of the Russian, now the 
United States possessions should be ten marine leagues measured by a line 
drawn " parallel to the windings of the coast." Canada contended that the 
" coast " meant the shores of the Archipelago while the United States main- 
tained that the ten marine leagues were to be measured from the continental 
coast-line. The wheels of diplomacy were at last set in motion and in Janu- 
ary, 1903, a commission was appointed, consisting of Lord Alverston, Chief 
Justice of England, Sir Louis Jette, a retired judge of the Supreme Court 
of Canada, and A. B. Aylesworth, a Canadian lawyer, representing British 
interests, and Elihu Root, Secretary of War, Henry C. Lodge, Senator of 
Massachusetts, and George Turner, formerly Senator from, Washington, on 
behalf of the United States. It was agreed that the decision of a majority of 
the commission should be binding on both nations. After many months' de- 
liberation the award was given in October in spite of the protest of the Cana- 



70 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

dian commissioners, who refused to sign it. By the verdict of the commis- 
sion the United States retained possession of the inlets of Alaska. At the 
mouth of Portland Channel, the beginning of the boundary, are four islands. 
Two of these, Pearse and Wales Islands, were awarded to Canada, while the 
United States received Sitklan and Kamaghmnut.

CHAPTER VL 
FUR TRADERS AND GOLD SEEKERS. 

In these old days before the gold rush, the history of the Northwest coast 
of America concerns itself solely with the trade in peltries, the " Company of 
Adeventurers and Traders trading into Hudson's Bay," and the native tribes 
with whom they traded are the only two classes thrown on the canvas. 

The year 1843 is a turning point. Fort Vancouver on the Columbia is 
near its end, the glory of the great McLx}ughlin is becoming dimmed, a new 
strong man holds the reins of power, a new city is building " Where East is 
West and West is East beside our land-locked blue." It is the parting of the 
ways. 

There were sound reasons for placing the Hudson's Bay Company Fort, 
the nucleus of the city of Victoria, where it was placed. The American 
claims tO' the possession of the " Oregon country," the first low threats of 
" fifty-four forty or fight " showed the wisdom of a stronghold north of the 
settlements on the Columbia, and in the sheltered harbors of Victoria and 
Esquimalt the fortbuilders fondly saw the outfitting base for the growing 
whale fleet of the Pacific. 

The site was not chosen on the impulse of the moment. As far back as 
1837 Captain McNeill explored the south of Vancouver Island and found 
" an excellent harbor and a fine open country along the sea shore apparently 
well adapted for both tillage and pasturage." Governor Simpson, going north 
from Fort Vancouver in the " Beaver " in 1841, remarks " the southern end of 
Vancouver Island is well adapted for cultivation, for, in addition to a moder- 
ate climate, it possesses excellent harbors and abundance of timber. It will 
doubtless become in time the most valuable section of the whole coast above 



72 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

California." Simpson's word carried great weight. For thirty-seven years 
he was the chief officer in America of the Hudson's Bay Company; from east- 
ern Canada to the Red River country he wandered and from Oregon to 
Alaska, and through this vast commercial empire his rule was unquestioned 
and his word was law. When, then, Simpson in person before the London 
directors advised a complete change of base from the Columbia, and suggested 
the site of the present city of Victoria as the location of the strong fort, the 
new regime may be said to have already begun. What were the advantages 
of Camosun (the Indian name of Victoria Harbor) ? It was near the Ocean 
and yet protected from it. Great islands were north of it, and to a huge con- 
tinent it was nature's entrepot. It stood at the crossway of the waters, Fuca 
Strait, Puget Sound, the Gulf of Georgia; and as whaling operations set 
northward might not a northern rendezvous and trading base be welcomed? 
The whole life and training of the Hudson's Bay servants made for keen ob- 

4 

servation, deep cogitation and careful balancing of cause and effect. Who 
shall say how far an insight into empire expansion was theirs, and to what 
extent they foresaw trade with the Alaskan north, the Mexican south, the 
near-by Orient and the far off isles of the sea ? The long-headed, keen-witted, 
silent Scots immediately connected with this movement were John McLough- 
lin, James Douglas, John Wark, Roderick Finlayson, Tolmie, Anderson and 
McNeill, all graduates of that stern Alma Mater the " Company of Adven- 
turers and Traders trading into Hudson's Bay," British North America's 
University of integrity and self-reliance and self-restraint. 

Shakespeare makes Coriolanus say, " What is the city but the people ? 
True, the people are the city." Let us for a moment look into the training 
through which they passed, these rugged men whom fate ordained to be found- 
ers of " a greater empire than has been." London was the headquarters of 
tlie Hudson's Bay Company, here sat the Home Governor and Board of Direct- 
ors. Next came the Governor in America, Sir George Simpson. Under him 
served the Chief Factors, next came the Chief Traders, usually in charge of 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 73 

some single but important post ; fourth, were the Chief Clerks, who went with 
crews of voyageurs on frequent expeditions or held charge of minor posts; 
and, fifth, followed the apprenticed clerks, a kind of forest midshipmen, un- 
licked cubs fresh from school or home — ^attracted to the woods by an outdoor 
love of freedom and thirsty for Indian adventures, whose duties were to write, 
keep store, and respectfully wait upon their seniors; sixth, postmasters; 
seventh, interpreters, advanced from the ranks of the hewers of wood and 
drawers of water because of some lucky gift of the gab or predilection for 
palaver; eighth, voyageurs; ninth, the great rank and file of laborers who 
chopped and carried and mended, trapped, fished, and with ready adaptability 
turned their hands to fifty different crafts at the sovereign will of their su- 
perior officers. The laborer might advance to be postmaster, the " middy " 
might become chief factor or governor. Five years the apprentice served be- 
fore he became clerk, a decade or two might see him chief trader or half 
shareholder, and a year or two more crowned his faithful life service by eleva- 
tion to the chief factorship. Broadly speaking, the chief factor looked after 
the outside relations of the company and the chief trader superintended traffic 
with the Indians. " Hard her service, poor her payment," Kipling sings of 
the East India Company, the sister company of commerce, which did for' the 
empire in the east what this did in the west. No doubt the life of the servant 
of the Hudson's Bay Company was hard, but it had its compensations, it de- 
veloped self-reliance and the hardier virtues of truth and courage and integ- 
rity ; here, if anywhere, a man stood on his own bottom and rose or fell by his 
own acts; each man in charge of a post, be it ever so obscure and unimpor- 
tant, to his little coterie of employes and the constituency of Indians with 
whom he traded, was a master, a governor, a ruler, his aye had to be aye, and 
his nay, nay for evermore, or his life would pay the foirfeit, it was no place 
for weaklings. That was the charm of the life, the lust for power is stronger 
than the lust for gold. The one great drawback to the career, of course, was 
it loneliness. The young trader or factor had neither time nor money to go 



74 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

back to civilization to seek a wife, his choice lay between single blessedness 
and a dusky bride. Generally he chose the latter. The year before the build- 
ing of Fort Victoria, Governor Simpson tells that in calling in at Stickine 
fifteen of the employes there had asked his permission to take native wives. 
Simpson granted them leave to accept what he is pleased disdainfully to call 
them " worthless bargains," being influenced perhaps more by the trade ad- 
vantages of these tribal connections than by any sympathy with unmarried 
loneliness. 

In secret justice to the " worthless bargains " it should be said that they 
almost invariably proved true, industrious, faithful spouses and loving moth- 
ers, they were subservient to their lords, they were content to remain obedient 
hand-maidens, and were imbued with no troublesome yearnings for the fran- 
chise and equal rights. Probably at times clouds connubial covered the 
horizon here as elsewhere, but it was not the warring of the New Woman 

and the Old Adam. 

The Beaver. 

It was the steamer " Beaver " that bix)ught Douglas and his fifteen men 
from Fort Vancouver on the Columbia that early March day of 1843 to Cam- 
osufi harbor. 

The " Beaver " as a history maker deserves more than passing notice. 
She was the first steamer to ply the waters of the Pacific and the first to make 
the voyage from Europe westward across the Atlantic. If we wish to attend 
the birthday christening party of the little " Beaver " we must go back to 
1835, i'^ the days of William IV, the Sailor King. No expense was spared 
in her construction, these were the palmy days of the Hudson's Bay Company, 
and well did the old " Beaver " repay her owners for the good workmanship 
put into her construction. For over fifty years in another hemisphere and a 
new ocean was she to do brave pioneer service, piling up an honorable record 
of work done squarely and unwasted days. At her launching the king at- 
tended in person and it was the hand of a Duchess that broke the christening 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 75 

bottle. Her engines were made by the first firm in the world to make ship's 
boilers, Messrs. Boulton &amp; Watt, her length over all being loi 1-3 feet. The 
company built an escort to the " Beaver," a barque of three hundred and ten 
tons burden, the " Columbia," and on the 29th of August, 1835, the two 
pioneers stole down the Thames mouth. The trans- Atlantic voyage was made 
without incident, and Cape Horn passed. Then for nearly four months, with 
her prow turned northward, did the plucky little black steamer ply the waters 
of an untried ocean. She was little and unpretentious and homely, but she 
was " the first that ever burst into that silent sea." Hencefr^rth the history 
of the " Beaver " is the history of the colonization of northwest America. She 
poked her inquisitive nose into river estuaries and land locked seas ; she made 
frequent trips as far north as Russian Sitka, and it was in her furnace that 
the first bituminous coal discovered on the coast was tested. 

We have seen that the " Beaver " brought to Camosun the founders of 
Victoria; in 1858-9 the "Beaver" carried the Cariboo miners to the new 
found Fraser fields ; next year she took a prominent part in the " San Juan 
affair;" she carried up and down the coast the imperial hydrographers who 
prepared the first charts of these northern waters, and she died in harness. 

It was on a summer night of 1888 that the little steamer piled up on the 
rocks at the harbor entrance to Vancouver City. For four years she hung 
there and none so poor to do her reverence. Then a passing steamer came 
close in one night and gave her her wash, the " Beaver " shuddered through 
all her oaken ribs, " they broke her mighty heart," and the great Boulton-built 
boilers slipped down into the sea. Then came the relic-hunter; her stern- 
board is preserved in the Provincial Museum, it was the end of her long life 
and an honorable one. 

No excuse is offered for this brief history of the " Beaver" — it is very 
pertinent to our subject; northward and westward — ^seaward, did Victoria look 
for her maritime commerce, northward and westward do we still look. 

From the Songhees village across the harbor did the curious and angry 



76 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Indians paddle out to inspect the " Beaver " that March day of 1843. What 
might it mean, this "big canoe, that smokes and thunders?" And James 
Douglas and his men, with what feehngs did these pioneers of long ago look 
around them as they stood among the wild lilies and heard the larks sing of 
spring? An empire's history is making that day, and this little group of 
fifteen men are about to begin a chapter. To this end they employ no cunning 
colors of the cloister, hewn logs and cedar posts are their writing tools, and 
although the scene be beautiful and enticing, and the thought that till now no 
European foot had trod these park-like vistas is even to prosaic minds a fas- 
cination — still they came for work these fort-builders and not for moralizing. 
The practiced eye of Douglas soon determined upon a site and all hands were 
at work digging a well and cutting and squaring timber. The appre- 
hensive and somewhat sulky Indians gathered round not too well pleased with 
the advent of the '* King George's men." Douglas in a characteristic speech 
told them that the whites came as traders and friends, they wanted furs and 
would give guns and blankets and trinkets, in the meantime as a " trial order " 
the Indians might bring in cedar " pickets " twenty-two feet long and three 
feet in circumference, for every forty pickets a blanket would be given. 
" Nowitka, delate bias kloosh !" and the trade of Camosun is begun. 

According to Bancroft, with the fort-builders came a Jesuit missionary, 
one J. B. Z. Bolduc, the first priest to set foot on the island of Vancouver. 
He was as warmly received as the traders were. Up the extension of the har- 
bor he reared his rural chapel of pine branches, and boat's canvas and cele- 
brated mass, upwards of twelve hundred converts crowning his zealous ef- 
forts, native Songhees and visiting brethren of the Clallams and Cowichans. 
If this be true then Father Bolduc's was not only the first, but the largest 
congregation yet assembled on Vancouver Island. 

Everything thus auspiciously begun, Mr. Douglas left the men to carry 
forward the work of fort-building, and himself proceeded northward in the 
" Beaver " to close Forts Tako, Stickine and McLoughlin, leaving Fort Simp- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 77 

son intact, then as now the northern outpost. On the first of June the return 
party of thirty-five with the goods from the abandoned forts arrived at Cam- 
osun, thus bring-ingf the force for the new stiX)nghold up to fifty men. Three 
months later the construction was completed. 

James Deans describes the fort as he saw it two years later. " The bas- 
tions were of hewn logs thirty feet in height and were connected by palisades 
about twenty feet high. Within the palisades were the stores numbered from 
one to five and a blacksmith's shop, besides dining hall, cook-house and chapel. 
The ground to the extent of an acre was enclosed by a palisade forming a 
square. On the north and south were towers, each containing six or eight 
pieces of ordinance (nine-pounders). The north tower was a prison, the 
south one was used for firing salutes. On the right, entering by the front or 
south gate was a cottage in which was the postofifice, kept by an officer of 
the company, Captain Sangster. Following round the south side came the 
smithy, the fish-oil warehouse, the carpenter's shop, bunkhouse, and in the 
corner a barracks for new arrivals. Between this corner and the east gate 
were the chapel and the chaplain's house. On the other side of the east gate 
was a large building, the officers' dining room, and adjoining this the cook 
house and pantry. On the next side was a double row of buildings for stor- 
ing furs previous to shipment to England, and behind this again a gunpowder 
magazine. On the lower corner stood the cottage of Finlayson, who was the 
Chief Factor, and his family, and beyond were the flagstaff and belfry." 

Finlayson had been the pupil of Douglas, as Douglas had been the pupil 
of McLx)ughlin. " Much from little " was the motto of these frugal Scots, 
Nails, like everything metallic, were legal tender with the Indians, they had a 
distinct commercial value, so when Finlayson was ordered to build Fort 
Camosun without a single nail, he did it. Mr. Finlayson was not the first 
factor in charge of the new post. Mr. Charles Ross, transferred from the 
abandoned Fort McLoughlin, was the first in command. Mr. Ross died with- 
in the fort gates the following year (1844), and was succeeded by Mr. Fin- 



78 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

layson. The historian owes a deep debt to Mr. Roderick Finlayson. In a 
carefully written manuscript of one hundred and four folio pages he gives a 
clear and comprehensive account of the " History of Vancouver Island and the 
Northwest Q)ast," indeed, were it not for Finlay son's record little would be 
known of these ante-gold days. This pioneer pilot of the destinies of Cam- 
osun was a shrewd, practical, clear-headed Scot, somewhat reticent about the 
company's business, but personally courteous, kindly, and most approachable. 

The Dividing Line. 

Up to this time (1845), the somewhat indefinite territory loosely known 
as " the Oregon country " had been jointly occupied by British subjects and 
those of the United States. It had not been in the interest of the fur traders to 
encourage immigration. But the time had come when this rich country could 
no longer be kept as a game preserve, settlers from both nations were pouring 
in and the question became insistent, " Who shall possess the land?"' 

Notwithstanding contentions to the contrary, Great Britain is not and 
never has been a land grabber, she has none of the hunger for territory which 
the nations attribute to her, and for every square mile of land she has consented 
to annex there are a thousand she might have had. When it is a question of 
acquiring territory, she is always slow to move. " Is the country worth hav- 
ing? " asked the English members of Parliament; " Is it worth fighting for? " 
McLoughlin when closely questioned to this end answered flatly that it was 
not. McLoughlin was a fur trader first, last and for all time; in the very na- 
ture of things he could not see singly in this matter. At last England took 
tardy action and in 1845 sent out H. M. S. "America," Gordon in command, 
to spy out the leanness of this indeterminate land. Gordon was brother of the 
Earl of Aberdeen, England's Prime Minister, and under him served Captain 
Parke, of the marines, and Lieutenant Peel, son of Sir Robert. Guiltless of 
any knowledge of either of the harbors of Victoria or Esquimalt, Gordon put 
in to Port Discovery and sent a dispatch to Factor Finlayson summoning him 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 79 

on board. For three days, Finlayson, hour by hour, instructed England's 
plenipotentiary on matters connected with tliis to him terra incognita. Then 
the junior officers, Parke and Peel, were sent via Cowlitz to the Columbia to 
see with their own eyes and judge of the desirability of acquiring the country. 
It is of these two officers that that persistent story is told which will not down. 
It is said that their viva voce report on returning to their ship was, " The 
country is not worth a damn, the salmon will not rise to the fly." 

Meanwhile the " America " had crossed to Victoria Harbor, and it was 
incumbent upon Finlayson to do the honors of host to the distinguished of- 
ficers representing the awe and majesty of the Mother Land. The bachelor 
quarters of the fort were not very luxurious, but it was easy to kill calves 
for the prodigals and provide a feast of fat things. " An Englishman's idea 
of pleasure is, 'Come, let us kill something/ " cogitated Finlayson, so after 
dining and wining he proposed a deer-hunt. A band of deer made its op- 
portune appearance (without the aid of beaters!), and the gay Gordon, 
mounted on the best cayuse the establishment boasted, got the leading stag in 
range, but the whole band incontinently took flight while the noble lords were 
adjusting their sights, and disappeared in the dense forest undergrowth. The 
commander, sputtering with wrath because the stag was inconsiderate enough 
not to stand at " Shun! " animadverted in choice Saxon upon the uncivilized 
nature of such a land. 

The sun shone brightly on the dancing waters of the straits, the crests of 
the Olympics stood up like rough-hewn silver, and peace and plenty smiled 
on every hand. But the deer had not waited to be killed. " Finlayson," 
swore Gordon, " I would not give one of the bleakest knolls of all the bleak 
hills of Scotland for twenty islands arrayed like this in barbaric glories." 

Next year (1846), a flotilla of British vessels appeared off Vancouver 
Island, the "Cormorant" Captain Gordon {not the deer-slayer); the "Con- 
stance," Captain Courtney; the "Inconstant," Captain Shepherd; the " Fis- 
gujard," Captain Duntze; and the surveying vessels "Herald" and "Pan- 



80 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

dora." Overland also came Royal Engineers, Lieutenants Warre and Vava- 
sour, arriving in Fort Vancouver by the annual express from York Factory. 
After " great argument about it and about," what is now known as the Ore- 
gon Treaty, was passed on the 15th of June, 1846, and the forty-ninth parallel 
became the dividing line between the nations. 

Paul Kane, the Wandering Artist. 

In April, 1847, appeared on the scene Paul Kane, a wandering artist, who 
in a very readable book describes " those wild scenes among which I strayed 
almost alone and scarcely meeting a white man or hearing the sound of my 
own language during four years spent among the Indians of the Northwest." 
Kane's interest was with the Indians, though we get from him not a few in- 
teresting sidelights on the paler pioneers. The word " Esquimalt," he tells 
us, is the place for gathering the root camass ; " Camosun " is the place of 
rushing waters. Across the harbor from the fort he finds a village of five 
hundred armed warriors, the men wear no clothing in summer and in winter 
affect a single garment, a blanket made of dog's hair and goosedown with 
frayed cedar bark. The Indians breed these small dogs for their hair. The 
hair is cut ofif with a knife and mixed with goosedown and a little white earth, 
then beaten with sticks and twisted into threads by rubbing it down the thigh 
with the palm., to be finally woven into blankets on a rude loom by the women 
of the tribe. 

Kane followed the Indian tribes into their loneliest lodges, lived with 
them, ate with them, slept with them, and so studied them from within. He 
tells vividly how the Songhees chief, Cheaclach, was inaugurated into his 
high office after thirty days of lonely fasting culminating in a wild orgy of 
dog-biting and biting of his friends ; the most honored scars are those which 
result from a deep bite given by a chieftain-novitiate — faithful are the wounds 
of a friend.

take the big sturgeon, weighing often from four hundred to six hundred 
pounds ; they are speared as they swim along the bottom at spawning season, 
to this end a seaweed Hne one hundred and fifty feet in length, spear-handles 
eighty feet long and detachable barbed spear-heads are used ; their fish-hooks 
are made of pine-roots. The Indians were exceedingly fond of herring-roe, 
which they were wont to collect in an ingenious way. Cedar-branches are 
sunk to the bottom of the river in shallow places by placing on them a big 
stone or two. The fish prefer to spawn on green things, the branches by next 
morning are all covered with spawn, which is washed off into water-proof 
baskets and squeezed by the hand into small balls. Kane says it is " very 
palatable," and he so describes fern-roots roasted. Kane ought to know, he 
was in like position with the old Scot who declared, " Honesty is the best 
policy, I've tried baith." 

Slavery in a most cruel form existed from California to Behring Straits, 
any Indian wandering off from his tribe might be seized and enslaved. The 
northern tribes played a grim sort of prisoners' base, and it was clearly advis- 
able " to stay by the stufif," for surely the " gobble-uns will git you if you 
don't — watch — out ! " The slavery that existed was of the most extreme kind, 
the master exercised the power of life and death over his slaves, slaves were 
killed to make an ostentatious display of wealth, the body of a slave was not 
entitled to burial. 

The making of a medicine-man was as weird a ceremony as the making 
of a chief. It, too, was preceded by a period of fasting ; the would-be medi- 
cine-man gave away every earthly possession before beginning his practice, 
depending thereafter wholly upon his fees. The medicine-man really was a 
magic-man, in direct communication with God, the " Hyas-Sock-a-la^Ti 
Yah." Kane notices in the big lodges of the coast Indians, houses big enough 
to accommodate eight or ten families, beatiful carved boxes of Chinese work- 
manship which reached Vancouver via the Sandwich Islands. During all 



82 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

these years there was regular commimication and no inconsiderable trade be- 
tween this tropical archipelago and the North American mainland. 

Kane had wonderful tact in dealing with the Indians; he overcomes 
their rooted prejudice to being sketched by telling them the picture is to go 
to the " Great Queen over the water " and then they crowd his tent to over- 
flowing, eager for the privilege, and proffer him their choicest delicacy, long 
strips of four inch whale blubber to be eaten " al fresco " with dried fish. 
Ingenious was the Indian method of capturing the whale. A flotilla of 
canoes went out. to the whale-grounds, sometimes even twenty or thirty miles 
from shore, each craft well supplied with spears and seal-skin bags filled with 
air, each containing ten gallons. The bags were attached to the spears and 
great numbers of the weapons were hurled into the animal's body; with the 
loss of blood he soon became too weak to overcome the upward buoyant 
pressure of the many floats, and cowed and dirigible, was towed tamely to 
shore to be dispatched at leisure. 

Kane met the historical Yellow-cum, chief of the Macaws, whose father 
was pilot of the ill-fated " Tonquin," the vessel 'sent out by John Jacob Astor 
to trade with the Indians north of Vancouver Island, and which was blown up 
in such a tragic manner. 

We get a glimpse, too, of the currency of these coast-wise tribes. The 
unit of value is the ioqus, a small shell found only at Cape Flattery, where 
it is obtained with great trouble from the bottom of the sea. It is white, 
slender, hollow, and from one and one-half to two inches long. The longer 
the shell the greater its \alue. When forty make a fathom, their united value 
is one, beaver-skin. If thirty-nine will make- a fathom, its value is two beav- 
er-skins and so on. A sea-otter skin at this time was worth twelve blankets. 
The Indians at the south of Vancouver Island flattened their heads, those 
at the north pulled them out into cones. On the opposite mainland were the 
Babines or Big-Lips, bone-lipped beauties whose lower lips were incised to 
carry patines of bone, shell or wood, sometimes so large that the ornament 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 83 

made a convenient shelf on which to rest the food. These people wear costly- 
blankets of the wool of the mountain sheep and bum their dead on funeral 
pyres. The way letters were carried by the Babines or Voyageurs is most 
interesting. An Indian gets a letter to deliver perhaps hundreds of miles 
away. He starts out in his canoe and carries it to the end of his tribal do- 
main when he sells it to the next man, who takes it as far as he dares and 
gets an augmented price for it, the last man delivers and collects full fare for 
the precious missive. The mail-carrier is never molested, he cries in choicest 
Chinook, " In the name of the Empress the Overland Mail." and is given 
ever the right of way. 

Important Hudson's Bay Company Posts of British Columbia. 

At this time there were six Hudson's Bay Company forts on the British 
Columbia coast and sixteen in the interior. At the southeast comer of Stuart 
Lake stood the capital of New Caledonia, old Fort St. James, the central 
figure of a cluster of subsidiary forts. Taking Fort St. James as pivotal 
point, one hundred miles northwest was Fort Babine, eighty miles east was 
Fort McLeod, sixty miles southeast was Fort George, and twenty-five miles 
to the southwest stood Fort Fraser. The highland surrounding Stuart Lake 
is a continental apex or divide whence flow the waters of the mighty Fraser 
southward, to the north and west the Skeena, while away to the north and 
east the winding Peace takes its tribute to the frozen ocean. 

On Liikes McLeod, Babine and Fraser were forts of the same names, 
and Fort Thompson was built on the Kamloops. Fort Alexandria on the 
Fraser was an important base, from here the northern brigade took its de- 
parture, and this post yielded an annual sale of twenty or thirty packs of 
peltries. From Fort Alexandria to Fort St. James the trafficking merchan- 
dise was carried by canoe. 

Why emphasize these paltry redoubts, little picketed enclosures sepa- 
rated each from; the other by leagues of mountain-morass, roaring torrents and 
well-nigh impenetrable forests? What do they stand for, these fly-specks 



84 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

on the map of a country into which continental Europe can comfortably be 
tucked ? To the Indians they are magazines of civilized comforts ; to the 
Honorable Hudson's Bay Company they are centers of lucrative trade, mo- 
nopolistic money-getters ; to the servants of the company we have seen they, 
in their loneliness, are grim character-makers; to us who follow after they 
are the outposts of empire, the advance guards opening the way for another 
off-shoot from the Grey Old Mother. It is history in the making. 

Fort St. James was a profitable station; it sent yearly to London furs 
worth a round quarter of a million. By horse brigade to these great centers 
came the goods for barter. The animals were sleek and well cared for, and 
where the iron horse now makes his noisy way these patient packers picked 
paths of their own through deep ravines, round precipitous mountain edges 
and across swollen streams, carrying the goods of all nations to lay at the 
feet of blanket-clad braves. 

The coast forts were Simpson, the first and most northerly sea-fort in 
British Columbia ; Langley, near the mouth of the Eraser ; Tako, on the Tako 
River; Fort McLaughlin, on Millbank Sound; Fort Rupert, at the mouth of 
Vancouver Island, and Camosun, whose name by transition through Fort 
Albert, must hereafter be known as Victoria, in honor of the Great and Good 
Queen. There was a connection other than commercial between these fur 
trading fortresses. As far back as 1833 Dr. W. E. Tolmie and Mr. A. C. An- 
derson of the Hudson's Bay service conceived the idea of establishing a cir- 
culating library among the different posts throughout the length and breadth 
of this great lone land. From London came the books and periodicals, and 
among the gay blankets and beads and flint-lock muskets carried by cayuse 
and canoe from post to post were tucked novels from Mudie's and works on 
art and religion and agriculture from the Old Land. By the time a copy 
of the Illustrated London News or the " Thunderer " had percolated from 
officers' mess all down through the service till it reached Sandy at the forge 
or Donald and Dugald driving the oxen, it was frayed away like a well worn 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 85 

bank note. This (1833-43) was the first circulating library on the Pacific 
Slope. In 1848 Fort Yale was founded, on the Fraser River, and Fort Hope 
the next year. Yale when built was the only point on the then untamed 
Fraser between Langley and Alexandria, a distance of three hundred miles, 
till' then untrod by white man. Yale was the head of navigation on the 
Fraser. . . 

Coal Discovered. 

Fort Rupert, at the north end of Vancouver Island, was established in 
the hope that it would prove the site of valuable coal mines. Coal was dis- 
covered there and a trial shipment made to England by Rear Admiral Sey- 
mour in 1847. B^^t Nanaimo, further south, was destined to be the coal 
center of the island. Credit for the discovery here attaches to Joseph W. 
McKay, of the company's service, who located the famous Douglas vein in 
1850, having heard of the " black stone that burns " from a communicative 
Indian. The fur traders knew a good thing when they saw it, and could turn 
their talents into acceptable channels. Before the expiration of 1853 two 
thousand tons were shipped from this point, fully half of which was taken out 
by the Indians. The company's price at Nanaimo was eleven dollars, and in 
San Francisco, now at the flood-tide of its gold-age, the coal brought twenty- 
eight dollars a ton. 

Two Strong Men of Kamloops. 

In 1846 two strong men reigned at Kamloops. John Tod was Chief 
Trader, and St. Paul, or Jean Baptiste Lolo, to give him the full title by 
which the Mother Church received him, governed the Shus-wap Indians with 
iron hand. 

Much of history and romance is woven into the name Kamloops. The 
establishment dates back to the days of the Northwest Company, being builded 
as long ago as 1810 by David Thompson the Astronomer. Alexander Ross 
in 1 81 2, on behalf of Astor's Pacific Fur Company, used it as his base, when 



86 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

no fewer than seven tribes traded there ; these were the palmy days. Worthy 
successor of these strong ones was John Tod, wiry, alert, keen, a man all 
through and through. And Jean Baptiste Lolo? He, too, was a striking 
figure and worthy the steel of even a John Tod. Every wanderer through 
the wilderness notes with joy these two chiefs, the white and the tawny, and 
the struggle for supremacy of the warring personalities. 

It was in Kamloops that the pack-horses were bred for the overland 
pack-trains, and horse flesh here was a staple article of diet. Captain R. C. 
Mayne, R. N.. F. R. G. S., pays his tribute to St. Paul: 

" In the center room lying at length upon a mattress stretched upon the 
floor was the chief of the Shuswap Indians. His face was a very fine one, 
although sickness and pain had worn it away terribly. His eyes were black, 
piercing and restless; his cheek bones high, and the lips, naturally thin and 
close, had that white compressed look which tells so surely of constant suf- 
fering. St. Paul received us lying upon his mattress, and apologized in 
French for not having risen at our entrance. He asked the Factor to ex- 
plain that he was a cripple. Many years back, being convinced that some- 
thing was the matter with his knee and having no faith in the medicine men 
of the tribe, the poor savage actually cut away to the bone, under the impres- 
sion that it needed cleansing. At the cost of great personal suffering he 
succeeded in boring a hole through the bone, which he keeps open by con- 
stantly syringing water through it." 

Such was Jean Baptiste Lolo. One can well imagine that such a man 
could not be found wanting in personal courage. Although obliged to be in 
his bed often for days at a time, his sway over his tribe was perfect. On this 
occasion, at Captain Mayne's invitation, he rose and mounted, and rode with 
the party all day, doing the honors of the District and giving Mayne double 
names for every striking feature of the landscape, the Indian name and Paul's 
fantastic French equivalent. For instance, the mountain upon which they 
climbed was Roches des Femm-es, for in summer many Indian women were 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 87 

to be seen scattered about its sides gathering berries and the bright yellow 
moss, Quillmarcar, with which they dye their doghair blankets. 

St. Paul accompanied Mayne as a guide upon his continuing his journey, 
claiming a place of honor at the " first table " and maintaining that silent 
dignity which sits so well on these strong men of a past age. Having for the 
time exchanged cayuse for canoe, Mayne says, " With all its many incon- 
veniences, there is something marvelously pleasant in canoe traveling, with 
its tranquil gliding motion, the regular splashless dip, dip, of the paddle, the 
wild chant of the Indian canoemen, or better still the songs of the Canadian 
voyageurs, keeping time to the pleasant chorus of ' Ma Belle Rosa,' or ' Le 
Beau Soldat.' " 

Thus happy we leave our chronicler and hark back to Paul Lolo's coun- 
terfoil, the astute Tod. It was the custom every spring and summer to send a 
party from Kamloops to the Pbpayou, seventy-six miles away on the Fraser, 
to secure a year's supply of cured salmon from the Indians. This year a 
Shuswap conspiracy was on foot to rob and slay the foraging party from the 
Fort, and to wipe out the establishment. Scenting the plot from a hint 
dropped by a friendly chief. Tod left his party, now well on its way, and alone 
entered the hostile camp. With ostentation he threw down his weapons, and 
told them that he had come as a messenger of mercy to save them from an 
impending scourge of smallpox. Fortunately he had a, small supply of vac- 
cine with him. Ready wit suggested his device, eloquence, a successful bit 
of play acting on a spirited horse, and his native fearlessness completed the 
conquest. Soon Tod had the would-be murderers felling a tree of immense 
proportions, that he might have a kingly stump from which to officiate, for- 
sooth ; and alone amid that band of determined cut-throats, the pawky Scot, 
with tobacco knife lancet, vaccinated brawny arm after brawny arm till day- 
light and vaccine were gone. The Indians went away his sworn slaves, hail- 
ing him with loud acclaims for ever after as their father and savior. Well 



88 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

indeed did they know and fear the plague smallpox, and he who would deliver 
them hence, was he not worthy of homage? 

McKay Meets Adam-Zad. 

In 1846 a strong figure looms large on the North Coast horizon. This 
is Joseph W. McKay, this year made General Agent of the North Coast 
establishments. McKay was staunchly true to the tenets of the company 
which he served, the one insistent article of whose creed was, " Get furs." 
Do Indian tribes show an inclination to go on the war-path? Their hostile 
intents must be turned aside, not because war is unholy, but because chiefs 
engaged in the gentle art of disemboweling their enemies and splitting the 
bodies of babies on wooden frames as salmon are split (Cf. History of 
Father Morice) are not able at the same time to trap beaver and marten and 
bring in priceless sea-otter skins. 

McKay had then to keep his aboriginal coadjutors in the gentle paths 
of peace, he had also a second part to play. Stationed up against the con- 
fines of Russian 'America, his it was to bend every faculty towards wresting 
the monopoly of the lucrative fur trade of these hyperborean fastnesses from 
the hands of Russia. To this end McKay had to pit his pawky Scottish wits 
against those of Adam-Zad, the Bear that walks like a man. It was a pretty 
game to watch, McKay says: "In 1847 ^ Chief of the Stikines, perfectly 
trustworthy, told me" that he had been approached by a Russian officer with 
presents of beads and tobacco, who told him that if he would get up a war with 
the English in the vicinity and compel them to withdraw, he should have 
gifts of arms and ammunition, a personal medal from the Czar of all the 
Russias, a splendid official uniform and a lucrative Russian market for his 
peltries forever." 

Nor was the plotting all on the side of the Russians. This same year 
Governor Shemlin of the Russian Company visited McKay at Bella Bella, to 
ask his co-operation in ending the inter-tribal Indian wars which were de- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 89 

moralizing' the fur trade. While the diplomatic McKay was dining and 
wining Shemlin, a confidential messenger came to the door to report the 
approach of a large fleet of the Hudson's Bay Company's canoes laden to 
the water-mark with furs stealthily procured in the Russian domain. McKay 
was quick witted. Word was sent to the flotilla to return to the harbor en- 
trance, and then McKay assiduously set himself to the task of making Shemlin 
gloriously and unconsciously dnmk. Scottish cordiality and Hudson's Bay 
Company's rum did the trick, and while Shemlin safely slept beneath the 
table, the illicit furs were packed away in the warehouses. 

The First Gleam of Gold. 

In 1848-9 Fort Victoria began to feel the reflex of the California Gold 
Excitement. At the new gold town of San Francisco prices were exorbitant, 
the minds of the thrifty among the Argonauts turned to the Northern Hud- 
son's Bay Company's Fort, where the best of British made goods could be 
bought at reasonable rates. Amid the reckless extravagance and prodigality 
which distinguished San Francisco in those early days there remained some 
who did not break saloon mirrors with $20 gold pieces or eat greenbacks in 
sandwiches. These, like Mrs. John Gilpin, " although on pleasure they were 
bent still had a frugal mind," and when winter closed their placers they char- 
tered vessels and sailed northward to bargain with the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany traders for their summer supplies. 

Finlayson, then in charge of Fort Victoria, says : " These fough look- 
ing miners landed here from their vessels in 1849. I took them for pirates, 
and ordered my men to prepare for action. They had, I soon found, leather 
bags full of nuggets which they wished to exchange for goods. I had never 
seen native gold and was doubtful of it; however, I took one of the pieces 
to the blacksmith shop and ordered the smith to beat it out on the anvil. The 
malleability reassured me and I offered to take the risks of barter, placing 
the value of the nuggets at $1 1 an ounce. Other factors followed my ex- 



90 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ample, and this year we had nuggets to ship to England together with onr 
furs." 

Finlayson thus naively recording his scruples about taking $i6 gold at 
$1 1 an ounce had no prescience of the fact that this very Fort where he pre- 
sided was destined within a decade to be itself the center of a gold excitement 
which shook two continents. With upsetting news of monthly earned mil- 
lions floating in the atmosphere, it required all the astuteness of a James 
Douglas to keep the ill-paid and frugally-fed men of the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany true to their contracts. In fact, from the Columbia posts, many de- 
serters made their way to the new El Dorado, some to return in the spring 
dazzling the sight of their cirdevant co-workers with $30,000 and $40,000 
pokes. 

Crown Grant of Vancouver Island to the Hudson''s Bay Company, 

1849. 

A fur company is a bad colonizer, foxes and beavers do not breed in 
apple orchards. The heart's desire of the Hudson's Bay Company was ever 
to keep the thousands of square miles of the Northwest one unviolated game 
preserve. After the fixing of the international dividing line at the forty- 
ninth parallel, the Hudson's Bay Company monopolists quaked with fear lest 
their American cousins, now pouring into the Western Coastal States, would 
pursue their maraudings north of the Oregon country and seriously jeopardize 
their Indian trade. True, several years of their exclusive charter had yet to 
run, till the year 1859 by direct treaty had the Mother Country promised 
them the privilege of sole trade with the natives. But with a free and pro- 
gressive people making permanent settlements to the south of them, founding 
cities and looking to the Sandwich Islands and Sitka and Mexico for trade, 
the eyes of the Mother Country might not longer be blinded to her own col- 
onization interests on the Pacific Coast, and in truth it was the intrusion of 
their own countrymen rather than the Americans that the fur traders feared. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 91 

Astute as ever, the officers of the company, Sir J. H. Pelly and Sir George 
Simpson took the bull by the horns. If the trade of colonization could not 
be stemmed, might they not contrive to get its current placed in their own 
hands so they might at least direct it? So we find Sir J. H. Pelly writing 
to Earl Gray in March, 1847, that the company was " willing to undertake 
the government and colonization of all the territories belonging to the crown 
in North America, and receive a grant accordingly." Small wonder is it 
that the ingenious modesty of this suggestion made even the lethargic Mother 
Land rub her eyes and consider. Then Sir J. H. Pelly and Sir George Simp- 
son modified their suggestion with the assurance that " placing the whole 
territory north of the forty-ninth parallel under one governing power would 
have simplified arrangements, but the company was willing to accept that 
part of the territory west of the Rocky Mountains, or even Vancouver Island 
alone, in fact, to give every assistance in its power to promote colonization." 

Consequently, in 1848, the draft of a charter granting them the Island 
of Vancouver was laid before the Imperial Parliament. Mr. Gladstone spoke 
against the bill, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce sent up a remonstrance 
and the press spoke strongly against the measure. Gladstone objected to 
giving a large British Island into the hands of a secret company whose meth- 
ods were exclusive and hidden and conducted in a spirit of absolutism, where- 
as the keynote of British government was openness. However, on the 13th 
of January, 1849, ^^^ grant was consummated, chiefly because in the opinion 
of the British law makers it would conduce to the maintenance of law and 
order, the encouragement of trade and the protection of the natives. 

By the terms of the charter the Hudson's Bay Company was given the 
island with the royalties of its seas, forests and mines. They were lords and 
proprietors of the land, promising on their part to colonize the island within 
five years, selling the land to settlers at a reasonable rate, retaining to them- 
selves ten per cent of such sales and applying the remaining ninety per cent to 
permanent improvements of the colony, roads, bridges and public buildings. 



92 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

The crown reserved the right to recall the grant at the end of five years if 
not satisfied with the evidence of good faith of the company, agreeing in 
that event to repay the company all moneys actually spent by them in colonizar- 
tion. This last clause made it a very good bargain indeed for the Hudson's 
Bay Company — they had capital, they had ships in regular communication with 
England, they had organization down to a fine point, they had been in northern 
North America for a century and a half, they knew the country as no one 
else had known it or would ever be able to know it, they were on the spot, 
and, lastly, they were their own bookkeepers. Not hard would be the task 
for the canny Scots to actually expend £10,000 and charge up the Common- 
wealth of England with five times that sum. Are not governments made 
to be fleeced? If the company were to hold the land after the trial trip of 
five years or to give it up, what did it matter? In either case, the company 
stood in to win. Lord Gray imposed the conditions of colonization, and 
therein exposed the hand of a tyro. The immigrant to Vancouver Island's 
shores had to pay a pound an acre for his land, and furthermore must produce 
five other men or three families also provided with their required pound ster- 
ling per acre to settle land adjacent to him. So each prospective settler of 
Vancouver Island was to be a capitalist, an adventurer willing to risk chances 
in an untried land, and also a real estate and immigration bureau in his own 
person. Astute Earl Gray! In Oregon to the south, free land was offered 
to the pioneer with no harassing restrictions, without money and without 
price. A British subject if a married man, merely upon declaring, his inten- 
tion of becoming an American citizen, was freely granted 640 acres of land. 
It was a case of patriotism versus pounds sterling to the incoming rancher, 
and the Hudson's Bay Company laughed up its corporate sleeve and continued 
its trade in furs. Statesmen talked, settlers complained, and the Fur Com- 
pany ruled. There is no burking the fact that the legalized colonizers of 
Vancouver Island retarded colonization. Was this a boon or a bane? There 
are so many points of view and so many factors in that complex question! 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 93 

British subjects were kept out, true. It is also true that the Hves of the In- 
dians were prolonged, aboriginal conditions were conserved for them and the 
dogs of development kept back. 

First Colonial Governor. 

On the loth of March, 1850, Richard Blanshard, the first Colonial Gov- 
ernor, landed from the deck of the government vessel " The Driver." The 
captain of " The Driver " and the officers of "' The Cormorant " in full uni- 
form, stood by while Blanshard himself read his Royal Commission. It was 
an anomalous position barren of all honor that poor Blanshard came to fill. 
There was no Government House for him to occupy, and except the Indians 
and servants of the Hudson's Bay Company, very few settlers indeed for him 
to govern, and sadder than all these, there was no salary whatever to go with 
all the gold braid. The government of Vancouver Island (i. e. Blanshard) 
kept his royal state for the present on board " The Driver," and nolens volens 
went where she went, to Fort Rupert, to Beaver Harbor, up and down the 
coast. When " The Driver " moved on Blanshard accepted a bunk within 
the Fort, and here took up his melancholy state. There were practically at 
this time no settlers on Vancouver Island independent of the Hudson's Bay 
Company, so Blanshard's rule degenerated into settling or trying to settle dis- 
putes between the officers of the Hudson's Bay Company and their servants. 
This was repugnant and abortive. 

Briefly, the Hudson's Bay Company by the terms of their charter were 
absolute, and Blanshard was not needed. In 1851 he sent to England his 
resignation, which was duly accepted, and all eyes turned to James Douglas 
as his inevitable successor. 

Blanshard made an attempt at a little brief authority before his departure 
by nominating a Provisional Council of three members, James Douglas, 
James Cooper and John Tod, to whom he administered the oath of office, it 
was his last and almost his first official act. In September, 1851, James 



94 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Douglas was duly made Governor of the colony, having been its ruler in fact 
for many years. Douglas now set himself to serve two masters, the Imperial 
Government and his old Alma Mater, the Honorable Hudson's Bay Company. 
With canny care he first arranged the important question of salary, in addi- 
tion to his honorarium as Chief Factor, he was to draw £800 per annum as 

Governor. 

Rule of the Douglas. 

When Douglas became governor Roderick Finlayson took his place on 
the Provisional Council. Colonization went on very slowly; the settlers in 
1853 on Vancouver Island numbered only 450, but even this scant population 
demanded some judicial functionary, so we find in 1854 Mr. David Cameron 
presiding in Victoria as Chief Justice of the Colony, with the princely salary 
of £100 per annum. Previous to this the only arm of the law had been Dr. 
Helmcken, whom Blanshard had appointed Justice of the Peace in 1850. In 
1858 Mr. Needham succeeded Chief Justice Cameron, himself giving place the 
next year to Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie. Sir Matthew was one of the dom- 
inant men who left strong finger marks on the history of British Columbia 
in the plastic days of its first growth. He continued to fill the position of 
Chief Justice of British Columbia until his death in 1894 in the 75th year of 
his age. 

At a period when firmness and discretion in the administration of justice 
were most needed, his wise and fearless action as a judge caused the law to 
be honored and obeyed in every quarter. Sir Matthew was a man of schol- 
arly attainments, and his versatility of talents evoked the admiration of those 
who best knew him. As a judge, the tendency of his thought was eminently 
logical, his judgment was fearless and decisive. 

In 1854 the Hudson's Bay Company had but one unexpired year of its 
charter, if settlement was not at least begun the charter must be lost. To 
meet this difficulty several of the leading officers of the company, Douglas, 
Work, Tod, Tolmie and Finlayson, purchased wild lands as near to the fort 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 95 

as they could get them, paying at the rate of a pound per acre for their hold- 
ings. Outside settlers were naturally dissatisfied with this Family Compact 
which thus reserved to itself the best of everything in sight, and in 1853 a 
petition was sent to the Imperial Government praying that the Charter on its 
expiry be not renewed. However, the petition was ignored, and in 1855 the 
Charter was renewed for a further five years. 

The First Legislature. 

On the 28th of February, 1856, Mr. Labouchere, Secretary of State for 
Britain, sent instructions to Governor Douglas bidding him call together his 
Council and arrange for the dividing of the country into electoral districts, 
and the subsequent election of the members of a Legislature. The result was 
the issuing of a proclamation on June i6th, 1856, dividing the country into 
four electoral districts, Victoria with three members, Esquimalt two members, 
Nanaimo one member, Sooke one member, and the elections were duly held. 
The first representatives of the new Assembly were J. D. Pemberton, Joseph 
Yates and E. E. Langford for Victoria ; Thomas Skinner and J. S. Helmcken 
for Esquimalt; John Muir for Sooke, and John F. Kennedy for Nanaimo. 

In connection with this election Dr. Helmcken made his maiden speech, 
which is the first recorded political speech of the colony. In it he strongly 
deprecates the feeling of indifference which had made it extremely difficult to 
secure candidates for an honorable seat in the new Assembly. 

The first Legislature met on the 12th of August, 1856, Dr. Helmcken 
was chosen Speaker. Governor Douglas delivered with dignity the inaugu- 
ral speech, which gives in a succinct and forceful way his conception of the 
status of the young colony. We transcribe it : 

" Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and of the House of Assembly : 
I congratulate you most sincerely on this memorable occasion — the meeting 
in full convention of the General Assembly of Vancouver Island, an event 
fraught with consequences of the utmost importance to its present and future 



96 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

inhabitants and remarkable as the first instance of representative institutions 
being granted in the infancy of a British colony. The history and actual 
position of this colony are marked by many other remarkable circumstances. 
Called into existence by the Act of the Supreme Government immediately 
after the discovery of gold in California, it has maintained an arduous and 
incessant struggle with the disorganizing effects on labor of that discovery. 
Remote from every other British settlement, w^ith its commerce trammelled, 
and met by restrictive duties on every side, its trade and resources remain un- 
developed. Self-supporting, and defraying all the expenses of its own gov- 
ernment, it presents a striking contrast to every other colony in the British 
Empire; and, like the native pine of its own storm-beaten promontories, it 
has acquired a slow but hardy growth. Its future growth must, under 
Providence, in a great measure depend on the intelligence, industry and enter- 
prise of its inhabitants, and upon the legislative wisdom of this Assembly. 
I am happy to inform you that her Majesty's Government 
continues to express the most lively interest in the progress and welfare of 
this colony. Negotiations are now pending with the Government of the 
United States which may probably terminate in an extension of the Reciproc- 
ity Treaty to Vancouver Island. I will just mention that an impost of £30 
is levied on every hundred pounds of British produce which is now sent to 
San Francisco or to any other American port. The Reciprocity Treaty ut- 
terly abolishes these fearful imposts and establishes a system of free trade 
in the produce of British colonies. The effect of that measure in developing 
the trade and natural resources of the colony can therefore be hardly over 
estimated. The coal, the timber, and the productive fisheries of Vancouver 
Island will assume a value before unknown, while every branch of trade will 
start into activity and become the means of pouring wealth into the country. 
The extension of the Reciprocity Treaty to this Island once gained, the in- 
terests of the colony will become inseparably connected with the principles 
of free trade, a principle which I think it will be sound policy on our part to 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 07 

encourage. The colony has been again visited this year by a large party of 
northern Indians, and their presence has excited in our minds a not unrea- 
sonable degree of alarm. Through the mercy of God they have been pre- 
vented from committing acts of open violence ; yet the presence of large bodies 
of armed savages who are accustomed to follow the impulses of their own 
evil natures more than the dictates of reason and justice gives rise to a feeling 
of insecurity which must exist as long as the colony remains without military 
protection. Her Majesty's Government, ever alive to the dangers which 
beset this colony, has arranged with the Lords Commissioners of the Admir- 
alty that the " President " frigate should be sent to Vancouver Island, and 
the measure will, I have no doubt, be carried into effect without delay. I 
shall nevertheless continue to conciliate the good will of the native Indian 
tribes by treating them with justice and forbearance and by rigidly protect- 
ing their civil and agrarian rights. Many cogent reasons of humanity and 
sound policy recommend that course to our attention, and I shall therefore 
rely upon your support in carrying such measures into effect. We know 
from our own experience that the friendship of the natives is at all times use- 
ful, while it is no less certain that their enmity may become more disastrous 
than any other calamity to which this colony is directly exposed. 

" Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, according to constitutional 
usage you must originate all money bills. It is therefore your special prov- 
ince to consider the ways and means of defraying the ordinary expenses of 
the Government either by levying a customs duty on imports or by a system 
of direct taxation. The poverty of the country and the limited means of a 
population struggling against the pressure of numberless privations must 
necessarily restrict the amount of taxation; it should therefore be our con- 
stant study to regulate the public expenditure according to the means of the 
country, and to live strictly within our income. The common error of run- 
ning into speculative improvements, entailing debts upon the colony for a 
very uncertain advantage should be carefully avoided. The demands upon 



98 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the public revenue will at present chiefly arise from the improvement of the 
country, and providing for the education of the young, the erection of places 
for public worship, the defence of the country, and the administration of jus- 
tice. 

" Gentlemen, I feel in all its force the responsibility now resting upon 
us. The interests and well-being of thousands yet unborn may be affected 
by our decision, and they will reverence or condemn our acts according as 
they are found to influence for good or evil the events of the future." 

The Family Compact. 

The personnel of the first Legislature of British Columbia was largely 
Hudson's Bay Company in its complexion. James Douglas was lord para- 
mount in his dual capacity as imperial viceroy and fur trader's factor in chief. 
Work, Finlayson and Tod, chief factor, chief trader and ancient pensioner, re- 
spectively, of the Hudson's Bay Company, comprised both secret council and 
house of lords. The seven wise men of the House of Assembly were also 
of the monopoly. Helmcken was staff doctor of the Company; Pemberton, 
surveyor and ardent attache ; McKay, clerk of the company ; Muir, a cidevant 
servant ; Skinner, an agent of the Puget* Sound Agricultural Company ; Ken- 
nedy, a retired officer of the company; Yates, by the grace of the company, 
merchant; David Cameron, brother-in-law of the Governor, was Chief 
Justice, and A. C. Anderson, retired chief trader, was Collector of Customs. 

Thus the Government of Vancouver Island continued until 1859, ^^ 
which time ended the second five years of the Hudson's Bay Company's colon- 
ial domination. It is hard for a man to serve two masters. Douglas had 
four to serve, namely, the Hudson's Bay Company's fur trade, the Colony 
of Vancouver Island, the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, and the, 
Nanaimo Coal Company. Humanly speaking, it was impossible for any one 
man to serve faithfully these four distinct and often antagonistic interests. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA . 99 

Gold. 

And now the conservative fur traders and the few pastoral off-shoots 
from the forts were to be startled by the insatiable auri sacra fames. Gold is 
discovered. In 1857 ^ small party of Canadians set out from the boundary 
fort of Colville to " prospect " on the banks of the Thompson and the Bona- 
parte. Other parties succeeded in making good strides, and immediately the 
news was in the air and soon a continent was inflamed. 

Between March and June in 1858 ocean steamers from California 
crowded with gold seekers, arrived daily in Victoria. The easy-going primi- 
tive traders rubbed their eyes and sat up. Victoria, the quiet hamlet whose 
previous shipping had consisted of Siwash canoes and the yearly ship from 
England, in the twinkling of an eye found itself a busy mart of confusion 
and excitement. In the brief space of four months 20,000 souls poured into 
the harbor. The followers of every trade and profession all down the Oregon 
coast to San Francisco left forge and bar and pulpit and joined the mad rush 
to the mines. It was as when the fiery cross was sent forth through the Old 
Land, men dropped the implements of their trade, left their houses uncared 
for, hastily sold what could be readily converted into cash and jtunped aboard 
the first nondescript carrier whose prow turned northward. The motley 
throng included, too, gamblers, loafers and criminals, the parasite population 
which attaches to the body corporate whenever gold is in evidence; the rich 
came to speculate and the poor came in the hope of speedily becoming rich. 
San Francisco felt the reflex action, every sort of property in California fell 
to a degree that threatened the ruin of the state. In Victoria a food famine 
threatened, flour rose to $30 a barrel, while ship's biscuit was at a premium. A 
city of tents arose, and all night long the song of hammer and saw spoke 
of rapidly put together buildings. Shops and shanties and shacks to the num- 
ber of 225 arose in six weeks. Speculation in town lots reached an unpar- 
alleled pitch of extravagance, the land office was besieged before four o'clock 



100 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

in the morning by eager plungers and some wonderful advances are recorded. 
Land bought from the company for $50 resold within the month for $3,000, 
a clay bank on a side street 100 feet by 70 feet brought $10,000, and sawn 
lumber for structural purposes could not be had for less than $100 per 1,000 
feet. The bulk of heterogeneous immigration consisted of American citizens 
who strove hard to found commercial depots in their own territory to serve as 
outfitting bases for the new mines. It is not speculators, however, but mer- 
chants and shippers who determine the points at which trade shall center. 
Victoria, combining the greatest commercial facilities with the fewest risks 
to navigation, soon came to the front as a shipping center; to this end her 
roadstead with its good holding ground and her whole mile frontage of deep 
water largely contributed. Of the great loads disgorged on the Victoria 
docks from the San Francisco steamers, most of the inglorious parasites, the 
Jews, brokers, Paris cooks and broken down gamblers stayed in Victoria to 
live by their wits, preying upon the fortunate miners, while the adventurous 
spirits pressed on up the Fraser toward the source of gold. All miners had 
to pay a monthly license to the government. 

The Fraser River begins to swell in June and does not reach its lowest 
ebb till winter; consequently the late arrivals found the auriferous ground 
under water. Thousands who had expected to pick up gold like potatoes 
lost heart and returned to California heaping execrations upon the country 
and everything else that was English. The state of the river became the 
barometer of public hopes and the pivot on which everybody's expectation 
turned, placer mining could only be carried on upon the river banks, and 
would the river ever fall ? A few hundreds of the more indomitable spirits, 
undeterred by the hope deferred which maketh the heart sick, pressed on to 
Hope and Yale, at the head of steamboat navigation, being content to wait 
and try their luck on the river bars there when at last the waters should fall. 
These intrepid men ran hair-breadth escapes, balancing themselves on precipice 
brink or perpendicular ledge, carrying on their backs both blankets and flour, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 101 

enduring* untold hardships, buoyed up only by the gleam of possible gold, 
that will-o'-the-wisp whose glamour once it touches the heart of a man spoils 
him for conservative work and till death comes leaves him never. 

These determined ones pass through miseries indescribable, creeping long 
distances ofttimes on hands and knees through undergrowth and tangled 
thickets, wading waist deep in bogs and clambering over and under fallen 
trees. Every day added to their exhaustion; and, worn out with privations 
and suffering, the knots of adventurers became smaller and smaller, some 
dying, some lagging behind to rest, and others turning back in despair — it was 
truly a survival of the fittest, and here as elsewhere hopeful pluck brought its 
reward. At length the river did fall, and the arrival of the yellow dust in 
Victoria infused new hope among the disconsolate. In proportion to the 
number of hands engaged on the placers, the gold yield of the first six months, 
notwithstanding the awful drawbacks of the deadly trails, was much larger 
than it had been in the same period in either California or Australia. 

The production of gold in California during the first six months of 
mining in 1849 was a quarter of a million. All the gold brought to Mel- 
bourne in 185 1 amounted to a million and a half. From June to October, 
1858, there was sent out of British Columbia by steamer or sailing vessel 
$543,000 of gold. But in this sum is not included the dust accumulated and 
kept in the country by miners nor that brought in by the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany or carried away personally without passing through banks or express 
office. It is a conservative estimate to declare that these last items would 
so augment the $543,000 as to bring it up to at least $705,000 for the first 
four months. Yet this wonderful wealth was taken almost entirely from the 
bed of a few rivers, bank diggings being entirely unworked. A very small 
portion of the Lower Fraser, the Bonaparte and the Thompson, was the exclu- 
sive sphere of operations, the Upper Fraser and the creeks fed by the north 
spurs of the Rockies remained an unknown country. 

The comparative figures of the gold yield were encouraging to those who 



102 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

thought, but much of the get-rich-quick element became disgruntled and re- 
turned to San Francisco, and the country was well rid of amateur miners, 
romantic speculators who built castles in the air and did neither toil nor spin, 
a spongy growth on the body politic. The stringent English way in which 
law was administered had no attractions for these gentry who fain would have 
re-enacted on British soil those scenes of riot and bloodshed which stained 
California during the first years of its mad gold rush. 

How Placers are Worked. 

To work placers one must have access to water, wood and quicksilver. 
In California mines water was very scarce, in New Zealand the early miners 
were hampered by the lack of wood for structural purposes, British Columbia 
had wood and water galore. Arrived in the auriferous region, the miner 
must first locate a scene of operations, this pursuit is called " prospecting." 
Armed with a pan and some quicksilver the prospector proceeds to test his 
bar or bench. Bars are accumulations of detritus upon the ancient channel 
of some river; they constitute often the present banks of the river; benches 
are the gold-bearing banks when rising in the form: of terraces. Filling his 
pan with earth the miner dips it gently in the stream and by a rotary motion 
precipitates the black sand with pebbles to the bottom, the lighter earth being 
allowed to escape over the edge of the pan. The pan is. then placed by a fire 
to dry, and the lighter particles of sand are blown away, leaving the fine gold 
at the bottom. If the gold be exceedingly fine it must be amalgamated with 
quicksilver. Estimating the value of the gold produced by one pan, the 
prospector readily calculates whether it will pay him to take up a claim there. 
In this rough method of testing, the superior specific gravity of gold over 
every other metal except platinum is the basis of operations — the gold will 
always wash to the bottom. 

Next to the individual " pan " comes as a primitive contrivance for gold 
washing, the " rocker." This is constructed like a child's cradle with- rockers 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 103 

beneath, and is four feet long, two feet wide, and one and one-half feet deep, 
the top and one end being open, a perforated sheet iron bottom allows the 
larger pebbles to pass through, and riffles or elects arranged like the slats of 
a Venetian blind and charged with quicksilver arrest the gold. The rocker 
takes two men to work, one pours in the earth and the sluicing water, the 
other rocks. 

On a still larger scale is sluicing, which is really the same principle ex- 
actly as the pan and the rocker adapted to a powerful series of flumes or 
wooden aqueducts, down which some mountain torrent is deflected, the gold- 
bearing earth being shoveled in from the sides. By means of an immense 
hose called a " giant," whole mountain sides of rich sand are broken down 
and subsequently treated. 

Quartz mining ultimately becomes the permanent method of extracting 
gold after the alluvial placers have been worked out. In these early days 
of gold mining in British Columbia, the quartz industry was not even in its 
infancy, requiring as it does money, machinery and concerted action to crush 
the imbedded gold from out the encircling quartz. Placer mining is poor 
man's mining, and has a charm, a glamour of expectancy which yields to no 
elaborately planned out campaign of imported machinery, consolidated com- 
panies and the selling of shares. The free prospector, singly or in partner- 
ship, works off his own bat, makes his own discoveries and locations and hugs 
to his soul each night the delirious hope of m.illions on the morrow. Gold 
fever is a disease that the doctors cannot cure, and if its fiery stream courses 
through a man's blood for two or three successive years, no conservative posi- 
tion in the world with a certain salary fixed and limited will have power 

to hold him. 

Early Placers of British Columbia. 

The Fort Hope Diggings first attracted the miners of the gold rush cf 
1858, the best paying bars being the Victoria Bar, French Bar and Marinulle. 



104 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

The official returns of this region give a minimum average of between $5 and 
$10 per man per day here. Two miners realized $1,350 in six weeks. 

The Yale Diggings embraced the river banks between Hope and Yale 
and for some distance beyond Yale again. Hill's, Emery's, and Boston Bars 
being the most noted diggings. The enormous rush of miners reaching first 
the Hope, Yale and the Lower Fraser, although by no means exhausting 
these grounds, did take the cream of the big gettings from these deposits, and 
now the cry for richer and more distant grounds went up. 

In California was gold not more plentiful near the source of the streams 
and are not the rivers of British Columbia greater than those of California? 
Further back towards the frozen ocean the fortune hunters will go. And so 
the peaceful settlers on Vancouver Island, on the Cowlitz, and from the valley 
of the Columbia, leave ox and plow and steading, the bond servants of the 
monopoly break their contracts and throw off their allegiance, the saw-mills 
of the Sound are silent, and the northern trek begins again. By sea and by 
land the Argonauts pour in, from Oregon they come and from California, 
from Canada and Europe, from Australia and these isles of the sea, and the 
world sees enacted the third great devil dance of the nations. 

Douglas, the King of Roads. 

Douglas was a diplomat, he looked ahead and he knew how to manage 
men. When the first benches on the Fraser were worked out, and the miners 
would fain push on and break new ground, it became imperative that a more 
practical and less hazardous route to the front must be opened up. The In- 
dians knew of a way from Lillooet, through the Harrison Lake and River 
and over the Douglas portages. In Victoria 5(X&gt; miners had their faces turned 
towards the new diggings. Douglas would try the virtues of co-operation. 
His proposition to the miners was this: Each man as an evidence of good 
faith would deposit $25 in the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company, and sign 
an agreement to work upon the trail until it was completed; the Hudson's 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 105 

Bay Company in return agreed to carry the miners to the point of commence- 
ment on the Harrison River, feed them all the time they worked, and give 
them back their $25 at the expiry of the contract. The length of proposed 
trail (including water way) was seventy miles. The scheme worked well, 
it was an object lesson in economics, the miners were well pleased with their 
bargain, and the Hudson'^s Bay Company found itself in possession of a 
money making toll-road. Miles were money in those days; beans that could 
be bought in Victoria for a cent and a half a pound were worth five cents at 
Port Douglas where the trail began, and at the end of the communistic high- 
way had increased to the value of a dollar and half a pound. 

Death of the Monopoly. 

Every monopoly dies in time, and even the Hudson's Bay Company, with 
its giant agrarian clutch, must pass under the law. On August 2nd, 1858, 
the Imperial Parliament passed an Act to provide for the Government of 
British Columbia, the new name given to that Pacific Province of the Mother 
Land, stretching from the forty-ninth parallel north to the Naas and the Fin- 
lay, and including the territory from the crest of the Rockies westward to 
the sea, with the Islands of Queen Charlotte and adjacent isles. With the 
expiration of the company's exclusive license to trade with the Mainland In- 
dians, the Imperial Government re-purchased the company's rights to Van- 
couver Island for the sum of £57,500. In the year 1863, the Hudson's Bay 
Company stations in British Columbia were reduced to thirteen, Forts Simp- 
son, Langley, Hope, Yale, Thompson River, Alexandria, George, St. James, 
McLeod, Connelly Lake, Fraser Lake, Sheppard, and Babine. 

Cariboo. 

In i860 the Cariboo rush began. The Cariboo country may be roughly 
described as lying between the headwaters of the Fraser and the Thompson 
in latitude fifty-two degrees to fifty-four degrees north. The chief river of 



106 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the region was the Quesnel, well known to the old Hudson's Bay Company 
traders, and the old Fort Alexandria lay but 40 miles distant. Previous to 
i860 the Fraser mining had been almost exclusively by rocker and sluice, and 
with the more or less satisfactory scratching of the surface operations had 
ceased, but in the new Cariboo country shafts and drifts and pumping 
machines are to penetrate the mysteries of deep placers. The 1,500 miners of 
Cariboo shipped to Victoria before the end of next year (1861), two million 
of dollars in coarse nuggets, and the name Cariboo became as well known 
throughout the world as either Sacramento or Ballarat. 

Each creek had a history of its own, Quesnel Forks being the first to 
develop into a permanent camp and early assuming the dignity of a small 
town. Here a party of five with two rockers took out in one week a hundred 
ounces of gold. On the south branch of the Quesnel below the outlet of 
Quesnel Lake mining operations persisted until the year 1872, at which time 
a gang of Chinamen were still making ten dollars a day to the man. 

In Cedar Creek exceptionally rich diggings developed, here the Aurora 
claim with sluices, flumes and working plant costing $8,000, yielded in the 
year 1866, $20,000, and in August of the next year it was paying one hundred 
ounces a week. On the right branch tributaries of the Quesnel was the 
famous Keithley Creek, at whose mouth in 1861, grew up the town of Keith- 
ley. On this creek in this year five men in a single day laid bare $1,200 in 
good sized nuggets, and their daily outget for a time was sixteen ounces of 
gold per man. In the autumn several companies turned out a hundred dol- 
lars a day to the man; the diggings continued on Keithley Creek until 1875, 
the conservative Chinee continuing for a decade afterwards to scrape these 
auriferous sands. In 1864 Cunningham Creek " made good " ; here a party 
of four white men unearthed an old river channel and one day took out $460 
apiece. 

The Antler Creek roused the interest of two continents. The London 
" Times " declared the bed of Antler Creek to be, like the heavenly streets. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 107 

paved with g-old ; rockers yielded easily fifty ounces in an hour or two, a shovel- 
ful sometimes realized $50, and good sized nuggets could be picked out by 
hand. The inevitable stampede followed, and by June, i860, houses, saloons, 
and sawmills were in evidence. Individuals at Antler made as high as $1,000 
a day, much of the ground yielding $1,000 to the square foot, the creek easily 
produced a gross output of $10,000 a day for the entire summer. 

Grouse Creek evolved the famed Heron claim which had a wonderful 
history. An original outlay of $150,000 put this claim in running order. 
It immediately yielded $300,000, and on the assumption that it was then 
worked out, the locators sold it for $4,000. The newcomers cut an outlet 
18 inches deeper than the previous one, with the result that for the whole of 
that season eighty ounces a week were produced. The Heron Claim re- 
mained quiescent until the year 1866, when in conjunction with the Discovery 
and other claims a yield of $15,000 to $20,000 per share was realized. 

Then Williams Creek looms large on the horizon. In 1865, Barkerville, 
on Williams Creek, became the distributing point for the whole Cariboo 
country, the aggregate output of which in seven years reached the total of 
no less than twenty-five millions of dollars. The gold here was found on a 
deposit of blue clay, the figures of individual earnings being astounding. The 
Steele party picked out of the clay 796 ounces in two days, their aggregate 
for two months being $105,000, while prospects of $600 to the pan are au- 
thenticated. 

The year 1862 eclipsed the year 1861, and 1863 was better than 1862, 
and from 1863 to 1867 the deep ground diggings of this Creek were the main 
producer of all Cariboo. 

Cariboo is a sea of mountains and pine covered hills, rising to the height 
of 8,000 feet above the sea level. Everywhere are evidences of volcanic 
eruption, strata are uptilted and the beds of old streams are heaved to the 
hill tops. Round this center of wealth the main artery of the Fraser wraps 
its semi-circular course and to the main stream the gold-bearing branches 



108 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

pour their tribute. Lightning, Antler, Keithley and WilHams Creeks take 
their rise in the Bald Mountains, radiating directly from a peak in this range 
known as the Snow-Shoe Mountain. In this mountain is supposed to lie the 
matrix of the Cariboo gold supply. The great drawbacks which confront 
the miner are the denseness of the encircling forests, the rugged formation of 
every foot of the land and the consequent arduous and expensive nature of all 
transportation work. Added to this is the shortness of the season for work, 
the severe winter precluding all operations between the months of October 
and June. 

The extraordinary yield of the Cariboo mines appears in the facts that 
in 1 86 1 the whole of Vancouver Island and British Columbia were Supported 
by the gold gotten from Antler Creek alone, and for four years Williams 
Creek supported a population of 16,000, many of whom left the country with 
large fortunes. And yet Williams Creek is only a narrow gully worked for 
less than two miles of its length in the roughest manner, the mining being 
practically a scratching of the surface unaided by costly machinery and desti- 
tute of steam or electric power.

CHAPTER VII. 
A POLITICAL OUTLINE. 

There are two sides to political history, an outside and inside. The one 
is contained in the records of speeches, in newspaper discussion, and in of- 
ficial archives. There are many blanks in the knowledge thus acquired. 
The other side is seen by personal contact with the principal actors in the 
political arena, by having access to the charmed circles behind the scenes. 
We also get glimpses of the inside in private diaries and journals, in letters 
not intended for publication, in autobiographies, in club gossip, in the heart- 
to-heart talks in the sanctum sanctorum of the home or office. These are in- 
valuable in completing the true picture of the times we wish to paint for the 
public gaze. They destroy many illusions, they explain many mysteries, they 
illuminate many manuscripts. British Columbia is not exceptional in having 
its secret pages of history, known only to those who were the principal actors, 
or those who had the entree to their confidences. To write a chapter on politi- 
cal events, which shall truly mirror them, requires the personal and familiar 
knowledge of the man who was contemporary with them, was an eye-witness, 
and mingled in the strife. There are few such men in the province qualified 
to discourse on them. Most of the generation who took part in the early 
scenes of political activity are dead. Of those who are still living by far the 
greater number have long since retired, and without being chroniclers of the 
daily routine, are not available for accurate reminiscences. The one man' 
who has been continuously active, as journalist and participator in public life, 
from the outset — that is, since 1859 — is Mr. D. W. Higgins, ex-editor of the 
Colonist, ex-M. P. P., and ex-Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. After 
passing through the California gold excitement and founding the San Fran- 



no BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Cisco Call, he came to British Columbia, attracted by the rush, and in i860 
started the Victoria Chronicle, subsequently amalgamated with the pioneer 
paper, the Colonist, with which he was identified as proprietor and editor for 
many years subsequently. Having had an intimate knowledge of affairs, 
such as a journalist and parliamentarian can obtain, and possessing an almost 
unfailing memory of details, he was asked to contribute a chapter outlining 
the course of politics during his long experience in the province, which he 
kindly consented to do. What follows is from his pen, and while to some 
extent it may be representative of his point of view for which he is responsible, 
may be accepted as a reliable summary of events within a lengthened and 
memorable period still within the memory of a lifetime. While the facts cor- 
respond in the main with the printed record there are many sidelights which 
give to the narrative peculiar interest and value. 



That the reader may intelligently grasp the political conditions of the 
British Pacific while under Hudson's Bay Company rule and before the ter- 
ritories of Vancouver Island and New Caledonia were formed into Crown 
Colonies, with one governor and separate civil lists, a brief history of the 
situation as it existed prior to the entry of the Colonies into the Canadian 
Confederation, and for some years subsequently, becomes necessary. 

Although Vancouver Island and New Caledonia (now British Columbia) 
were ruled by Sir James Douglas, the Company's chief factor, the American 
element largely predominated ; but there was a fair sprinkling of British sub- 
jects from all parts of our great empire, including many from the Canadas 
a'nd the Maritime Provinces. The men from the Colonies, having left a 
constitutional form of government behind them, chafed and fretted under the 
form of government that they found here, and those who settled in and about 
Victoria almost at once began an agitation for a representative government. 
In the fall of 1858, when the miners had returned from their claims on the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 111 

mainland, to pass the inclement months at Victoria, the agitation for reform 
began to take definite shape. Many of the colonial men had mixed in politics 
in their homes. Some were good talkers and could make speeches from the 
platform that stirred the people, and it was not long before the government 
was denounced on all sides as a despotism, a family compact, an oligarchy, 
etc., etc. 

Opposition to Hudson's Bay Company Rule. 

The Pacific Colonies at that time occupied an anomalous position politic- 
ally as well as commercially. Victoria was the centre of gDvemment, of 
finance and trade. It was the place where the immigrant landed from the 
ship that conveyed him to these shores. It was there that he outfitted for 
the Mainland mines, and it was the place where he bade adieu to civilization 
and plunged into the trackless wilds of New Caledonia in search of hidden 
treasure. There was a staff of officials for each colony, but both staffs re- 
sided at Victoria. Governor Douglas held the reins, presided at both council 
boards, and curbed with a strong hand any attempt to curtail his powers as 
the irresponsible head of two irresponsible executives. There was a sem- 
blance of representative government, but it was a mere mockery. A few 
. popular members were returned to what may be properly designated a 
" mock " parliament, but the official members of the legislative assembly, who 
were all nominees of the governor, were largely in the majority and were 
ever ready, under instructions from the ruling hand, to vote down any meas- 
ure that proposed to confer constitutional rights upon the people. The man- 
ner in which the popular members were returned was unique. It would 
have been amusing if it had not possessed an intensely dramatic side, in that 
it was devised with the object of stifling the voice of the people, and for 
years that object was successfully attained. No. elector could vote unless 
he had a property qualification of £io and had been registered as a voter for 
a certain time before the election. Upon one occasion, in 1859, at the vil- 



112 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

lage of Nanaimo, which had not then come to the front as a coal-producing 
centre and contained a few score of inhabitants, mostly Hudson Bay Com- 
pany's traders, only one man was found to possess the two necessary qualifi- 
cations — ^property and registration. The voting was open. The sheriff 
mounted a packing case and opened the poll, with all the solemnity of a 
returning officer presiding over a great English or Canadian constituency, 
by reading the Governor's proclamation that informed the true and loyal 
voter (s) of Nanaimo that a vacancy had occurred in their (his) representa- 
tion and that it became their (his) duty to fill the said vacancy by returning 
a loyal Briton to represent them (him) in the legislative assembly. Where- 
upon, a certain Captain Stuart, the solitary voter, nominated Charles A. 
Bayley, a Victoria hotel-keeper. A bystander who was not a voter seconded 
the nomination. The poll was then declared open. Captain Stuart cast his 
vote for his man at 4 o'clock, and there being no other voters or candidates, 
the sherijff declared Charles A. Bayley duly elected a member of the Legis- 
lative Assembly. The proceedings in other districts were equally farcical, 
the only difference being that instead of one voter the number ranged from 
half-a-dozen to twenty. Some of the electors by virtue of owning land had 
votes in every district. 

At that time the undoubted leader of the Colonials, who had gathered 
at Victoria, was Amor de Cosmos. He was an energetic and able worker, 
and being fearless and having had some political experience in Nova Scotia, 
he was admirably fitted for the position. He started the British Colonist 
and bombarded the governor and his friends with liberal literature of the 
fiercest kind thrice each week. In his writings Mr. De Cosmos was assisted 
by a contributor who wrote over the signature of " Monitor," but whose 
name was Charles Bedford Young. Mr. Young was a bitter and sarcastic 
writer. Many of his articles were libellous, and, looking back now over the 
many years that have elapsed since that warfare was waged, one is surprised 
when he is told that Young and De Cosmos never found themselves on the 




RAPIDS, KICKING HORSE RIVER.

wrong side of the lock-up. On one occasion the government did essay to 
" muzzle the press " by ordering De Cosmos to discontinue the publication 
of his paper until he should furnish bonds to the sum of £ 1,000. as required 
at that time in Great Britain from all publishers. De Cosmos suspended 
publication, the people espoused his cause, the bonds were furnished with a 
rush and the publication was resumed. On another occasion, in i860, the 
publisher was brought before the legislative assembly for libelling the Speaker. 
He was arrested by the clerk of the assembly — a mite of a man named Cap- 
tain Doggett — and an apology was" demanded. The apology was offered 
and accepted and the prisoner released. 

In 1859 George Hunter Cary, a barrister who had been appointed 
attorney-general of the two colonies, arrived from England. Mr. Cary was 
a very able man, but he was short-tempered and irascible. In his bursts 
of passion he was known to denounce the (then) Chief Justice Cameron as 

a " old fool," cast his wig and gown on the floor and rush from the 

courthouse, remaining away until he had been coaxed to go back by his client 
and resume his toggery and argument; but he was never asked to apologize. 
Now it happened that Mr. De Cosmos was as short-tempered as the attorney- 
general, and it was not long before these two men clashed. It was over an 
election for Victoria City. De Cosmos was nominated by the opposition and 
Selim Franklin by the government. De Cosmos' return seemed certain, but 
on the eve of the election, acting on the advice of Cary, a large number of 
American negroes, who had been driven from their homes by their white 
countrymen, were placed on the roll of voters and Franklin was returned. 
Petition after petition was filed, but the legislature refused to unseat Frank- 
lin, and he held on to the end. The next important question that agitated 
the Victoria public was the Victoria water supply, just as at the present day, 
nearly half a century later, a similar agitation has been launched. At the 
time of which I write, Victoria was supplied with water by carts that went 
from door to door. The water was obtained from Spring Ridge, where a 



114 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

spring- had been utilized for many years by tlie Hudson's Bay Company and 
its tenants. In this spring Cary thought he saw a chance to turn a few honest 
dollars. So he purchased the lots on which the spring stood from the com- 
pany and fenced in the water. The car men, the following day, were in- 
formed that unless they paid a tax of a shilling a barrel no more water would 
be supplied them. Popular indignation was at once aroused. The papers 
denounced the sale of the people's water supply as an unpardonable sin. Pub- 
lic meetings were called. At these Cary was hooted from the platform and 
the populace passed strong resolutions. In the midst of the excitement a 
New Brunswicker cut down the fence and the car men filled their barrels un- 
molested. The attorney general received back his money, and the sale was 
cancelled, but from the day when he secured the right to the spring Cary's 
popularity and influence declined. He was the constant object of attack 
and the mere mention of his name called forth the most vituperative expres- 
sions. He built the late Cary Castle, lost all his money and returned to 
England in 1867, where he died in a madhouse. The agitation for constitu- 
tional government continued unabated. In 1863 the franchise was extended 
and Mr. De Cosmos was returned with several supporters; but what could 
six popular members effect in a legislature of fifteen? 

In March, i860. Governor Douglas, attired in vice-regal uniform and 
accompanied by a brilliant staff of naval and military officers, convened the 
second Legislative Assembly of Vancouver Island in the public buildings at 
James Bay. There had been a Legislative Assembly in 1856, which was pre- 
sided over by Hon. Dr. Helmcken, and the members were nearly all Hudson's 
Bay Company's employes. There was very little ceremony observed and as 
there were no newspapers at the time the doings of the body were never made 
public. At the opening in i860 Dr. Helmcken was elected Speaker, and the 
speech was read by the clerk, the Governor, his staff, the Speaker, and the 
audience standing during the ceremony. The speech promised a great many 
things that were never carried out and which were probably only inserted to 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 115 

quiet the public mind, which by this time had become very pronounced and 
often threatening* in favor of responsible government. This House only 
lived through two sessions, but during its existence a strange thing happened. 
One of the popular members who sat for Esquimalt was George Tomline 
Gordon. In 1861 he was made colonial treasurer, and the government con- 
ceived the brilliant idea of causing him to resign and stand for re-election, 
although there was no constitutional provision that required him to take that 
step. In fact, there was no constitution. De Cosmos was put up to oppose 
Gordon, The vote, five minutes before the poll closed, stood ten and ten. 
De Cosmos' real name was William Alexander Smith, but in California, by 
an act of the legislature, he was permitted to assume the name of Amor de 
Cosmos. On the occasion of the Esquimalt election he stood as William 
Alexander Smith, commonly known as Amor de Cosmos, and his friends so 
voted for him. The last man made a grievous error. He forgot the long 
formula and voted for " Amor de Cosmos," and his vote was so recorded. 
The polls being closed, the sheriff announced a tie between Gordon and Smith, 
and one vote for Amor de Cosmos. He then voted for Gordon, whom he 
declared elected. Above the Legislative Assembly there sat the governor 
with his executive council, who promptly stifled every measure of a popular 
nature which the government nominees in the lower house might permit to 
pass. The sittings of the assembly were open and reporters took and pub- 
lished notes of the proceedings. So a government member, who did not 
wish to incur public opprobrium by opposing a popular measure in the open, 
voted for it. The measure then went before the executive council and was 
quietly strangled there, no reporters being present. 

Independent Colonial Government. 

About this time the Hudson's Bay Company surrendered the unsold public 
lands which they held under a patent from the Crown and the Imperial Gov- 
ernment. Lord Lytton, being Colonial Secretary, proclaimed the colonies of 



116 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Vancouver Island and British Columbia. Governor Douglas was made Gov- 
ernor of both and New Westminster was declared the capital of British 
Columbia, Colonel Moody, an officer of the Royal Engineers, was made 
Lieutenant Governor, with a residence at New Westminster, and the staff of 
the Mainland Government, which had resided all these years at Victoria, re- 
moved to New Westminster, and took up their quarters at Sapperton, a short 
distance from the new capital, where a handsome Government House was 
afterwards built. It must be rernembered that while Vancouver Island had 
" enjoyed " the shadow of a representative form of government the Main- 
land had not even had the shadow. It was governed directly from Victoria, 
where the officials resided, until Lord Lytton's accession to the Colonial 
Office. John Robson, a writer of great force and an able orator, had mean- 
while established the Columbian newspaper and fired a weekly broadside at 
the one-man government. 

In 1864 the Home Government awoke to a sense of the anomalous con- 
uition of public affairs in the Pacific colonies, and appointed Colonel Ken- 
nedy Governor of Vancouver Island, and Mr. Frederick Seymour Governor 
of British Columbia, with separate civil lists. The new governors arrived 
early in 1864 and both caused elections to be held in their respective colonies. 
The official element predominated in the legislatures and the sessions were 
marked by acrimonious debates and the passage of many undesirable meas- 
ures. The civil list salaries were enormous. Governor Kennedy was voted 
$15,000.00 per annum, and Cary Castle, destroyed by fire in 1898, was pro- 
vided for him as a gubernatorial residence. Governor Seymour was voted 
$20,000.00 per annum and a $50,000.00 residence was built for him. A feel- 
ing of intense rivalry sprang up between the two provinces. This was em- 
phasized in 1866 by the passage of a series of resolutions through the Island, 
legislature asking the Imperial Government to unite the two colonies under 
one governor with one civil list. Victoria, from its early settlement about 
30 years before, had been a free port, no duties being levied upon imported 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 117 

gxx»ds. The revenue for the support of the Government was derived from 
direct taxation, which caused the burden to fall heavily upon property-owners 
and business men. Mr. De Cosmos succeeded in passing a resolution calling 
upon the government to impose a scale of customs duties, which the govern- 
ment, being pinched for means, promptly did. The Imperial Government 
approved of the scheme for uniting the colonies. They abolished the colony 
of Vancouver Island and organized the Pacific possessions into one colony 
under the name of British Columbia, with New Westminster as the capital. 
The Islanders were furious at the loss of their political identity and the seat 
of government, and a movement was begun in favor of Victoria being made 
the capital of the united colonies. Governor Seymour vigorously opposed the 
proposition to remove the capital to Victoria. He did not like the Islanders 
and the Islanders did not like him. But they wanted the capital even if Mr, 
Seymour should come with it. In 1877 the Imperial Government proclaimed 
Victoria as the capital, and New Westminster submitted with very bad grace 
to the inevitable. The costly and pretty Government House, heartbroken by 
the change that had come over its fortunes, rapidly fell into a state of decay 
and delapidation, and the place where it once stood is now scarcely recog- 
nizable. 

The Confederation Movement. 

The erection of the Maritime Provinces and the Canadas into a Confed- 
eration took place on July i, 1867. British Columbians were not slow in 
organizing a party that favored the admission of the colony into the confed- 
eration, if by so doing they could secure responsible government. Mr. De 
Cosmos went to Ottawa in 1867 and Mr. Higgins went there in 1868 to 
urge upon the Federal Government the importance of admitting British Co- 
lumbia into the union, and so put an end to a feeling that existed at Victoria 
in favor of annexing the colonies to the United States, and which was becom- 
ing uncontrollable. 

In 1869 Governor Seymour summoned a Legislative Council, a majority 



118 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of which were officials. Mr. De Cosmos, during the first session of the 
council, had for his lieutenant Thomas Basil Humphreys, a bold, aggressive 
man, with a voice like a clarion and a flow of language that seemed never 
ending. Mr. J. W. Trutch (after Sir Joseph), chief commissioner of lands 
and works at the time, was leader of the Legislative Council, and an attempt 
made by the popular members to pass resolutions favoring confederation was 
voted down by the official members. The people were enraged and a public 
meeting was convened at the theatre, which was densely crowded. At that 
meeting " Tom " Humphreys delivered a violent speech, in which he attacked 
" Joe " Trutch as a traitor, a boodler, a self-seeker and an all-round, unde- 
sirable citizen. The Government members were incensed at Humphreys' 
language and his attack on Mr. Trutch. When, upon the following day, 
Humphreys appeared at the House, he was confronted with the scandalous 
remarks as reported in the press, and asked if the report was correct. He 
replied: " It is certainly correct." A resolution was then moved calling upon 
him to apologize to Mr. Trutch and the Council for his words. He refused 
to apologize to Mr. Trutch, and delivered a bitter speech, in which he declined 
to retract one word. An amendment was then offered to the resolution that 
provided for his expulsion, and he was expelled by an almost unanimous 
vote. He left the Council chamber and was received by an immense throng 
on Government street and loudly cheered, and at night he was serenaded, 
when he made a characteristic speech in which he repeated word for word 
his attack upon the chief commissioner. On the next night a mass meeting 
was held at the theatre, where he again attacked Mr. Trutch and hurled de- 
fiance at his " persecutors." Resolutions condemnatory of the action of the 
Council were carried unanimously and Humphreys was presented with a valu- 
able gold watch, duly inscribed, together with the freedom of the city, and 
a chain as a mark of public approval. A writ was issued to fill the vacancy 
caused by Mr. Humphreys' expulsion. He was triumphantly re-elected for 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 111&gt; 

Lillooet, and took his seat at the Council board, where he remained unmo- 
lested, but did not again attack the chief commissioner. 

But if in 1870 the official members of the Legislative Council were op- 
posed to confederation and passed resolutions declaring that the time had not 
arrived for entering the union, a rapid change of front took place during 
the recess. In the summer of 1870 Governor Seymour, who had been known 
to be strongly opposed to confederation, was taken seriously ill. He was 
never a strong man, and his constitution had been undermined by the climate 
of Honduras, where he filled the position of Governor before being sent to 
the Pacific colony. He was advised to take a sea voyage and embarked in 
Her Majesty's ship Sparrowhawk for a cruise along the Northwest coast. 
He failed rapidly and at Bella Coola he passed away. The body was brought 
back to Esquimalt and buried in the naval cemetery, where it reposes beneath 
a handsome monument erected by his widow. 

Sir Anthony Musgrave, Governor of Newfoundland, was appointed to 
succeed the late Governor. He arrived here in the fall of 1870, and it was 
understood that he had received instructions to favor a policy that would 
insure the admission of British Columbia into the Canadian Confederation 
upon just and equitable terms. The Legislative Council was dissolved and 
elections were held throughout the colony. The popular members were all 
or nearly all in favor of joining the confederation. When the Council met 
Mr. Trutch introduced a series of resolutions asking for the admission of 
British Columbia into the Canadian Confederation. The terms were dis- 
cussed with more or less heat. Some of the speeches were eloquent. The 
popular members taunted the official members with having received assur- 
ances that they would be pensioned or billeted on some other unfortunate 
colony for the balance of their lives. 

Mr. De Cosmos introduced a resolution which demanded as one of the 
terms that responsible government should be guaranteed the new province. 
The resolution was voted down by the officials, aided by two or three popular 



120 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

members. It was held that the system of government should not form part 
of the terms, but must be left for the action of the electorate after the con- 
federation. The elected members contended that if this opportunity for a 
change of the system was lost, years might elapse before another opportunity 
would present itself for securing a popular form of government. The Gov- 
ernment carried their point, and the responsible government resolution was 

negatived. 

Arranging the Terms. 

The greatest stumbling block to the immediate passage of the union 
resolutions lay in the question of overland communication. Scarcely anyone 
believed that Canada, then in her swaddling clothes, having been born, na- 
tionally, only three years before, would guarantee a railway. The most en- 
thusiastic advocates of the confederation of this colony with the young nation 
at the east scarcely dared hope for railway construction within a generation, 
and a demand for a wagon road with steamboat connection on the water 
stretches of the Middle West known as the Great Lakes, was all that most 
men expected. The newspapers, as in duty bound, maintained a constant 
fire on the Legislative Council, declaring that nothing short of a railway 
would lure British Columbia into the Confederation. But the Councillors, 
after several days of labor, delivered themselves of a clause that adopted 
the wagon road suggested and with that modest demand the section went 
through. 

Another important matter that evoked much discussion was the question 
of tariff. At the union of the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Co- 
lumbia the free pQrt of Victoria was abolished and for it was substituted the 
tariff in force on the Mainland previous to the union. This tariff averaged 
about I2J/2 per cent, there being a long list of goods that were admitted duty 
free. Canadian goods were treated as foreign goods and were taxed accord- 
ingly. The British Columbia tariff was not intended to afford protection. 
It was for revenue only. The customs duty in force in Canada at that time 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 121 

averaged scarcely 15 per cent, a rate which the early legislator deemed ample 
for all purposes. Now, notwithstanding the abolition of the free port, three 
years before, there remained a good many people who believed that with that 
abolition the sun had begun to set on Victoria's commercial interests. They 
argued that the policy of the Crown Colony Government had been to make 
Victoria the storehouse of the Pacific, where goods of every description might 
be accumulated in vast quantities, and from which the stocks of merchants 
along the whole coast might be repleted as occasion required. Impressed 
with this idea, several importing firms had erected fireproof warehouses on 
the water front, and the wharves that still stand in the inner harbor were 
placed there for the accommodation of heavy stocks of merchandise of various 
descriptions. The owners of these warehouses and wharves and the heavy 
importers were most energetic in their endeavors to have the free port re- 
stored. Failing in that, they pressed for a clause that would permit British 
Columbia to retain her 12^/4 per cent tariff until after the completion of an 
overland railway. This last proposition was finally agreed to, subject to 
any action which the Legislative Assembly of the new province, to be cre- 
ated by proclamation after the final adoption of the terms, might take. It 
is almost needless to say that at its first session the Legislative Assembly 
passed resolutions in favor of the adoption of the Canadian tariff, and we 
have since lived and prospered under it in spite of the fact that the scale of 
duties in force in 1871 has been more than doubled in pursuance of the pro- 
tection policy of Sir John Macdonald, which policy has been emphasized and 
confirmed by their successors. 

Another matter which occupied the earnest attention of the Legislative 
Council was the financial basis on which the colony should enter the Confed- 
eracy. It was finally agreed that an annual subsidy of $35,000 and an annual 
grant equal to 80 cents per head of a population of 60,000, to be augmented 
in proportion to the increase of population at each subsequent decennial census 
until the population reached 400,000, at which rate such' grant should there- 



122 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

after remain, should be paid the province. It was further stipulated that 
the Dominion Government should assume the colony's debt (about 
$2,000,000), guarantee the interest for ten years from the date of the com- 
pletion of the works at the rate of 5 per cent per annum on such sum not ex- 
ceeding £100,000 sterling as might be required for the construction of a 
first-class graving dock at Esquimalt. The Dominion was further required 
to provide for the salaries of the Lieutenant-Governor, judges, customs offi- 
cers, postal and telegraph employes, fisheries and militia, and to maintain 
lighthouses, buoys and beacons, quarantine hospitals, geological surveys and 
the penitentiary. The Dominion was also asked to provide for pensions for 
the retiring Crown Colony officers, and British Columbia was declared to be 
entitled to six commoners and three senators in the Parliament at Ottawa. 

The terms having been finally passed by the Legislative Council and ap- 
proved by Governor Musgrave in council, it now became necessary to appoint 
three delegates to bear the precious document to Ottawa and present it in 
person to the Governor-General in council. Hon. Mr. Trutch, Hon. Dr. 
Carrall and Hon. Dr. Helmcken were selected as the delegates. Dr. Helmc- 
ken declined and the Hon. John Robson was suggested in his stead. Indeed, 
his appointment was on the eve of being gazetted, when Mr. Robson's enemies 
urged Dr. Helmcken to go. The opposition to Mr. Robson was based on 
the facts that he was an advocate of responsible government and that he and 
Mr. Trutch were not on good terms. The doctor finally relented and the 
delegation as originally planned left for the east. 

At that time little was known of the vast Pacific empire, with its bound- 
less resources of forest, mineral and fossil wealth, its inexhaustible fisheries 
and its genial and health-giving climate. Although possessed of every re- 
source which, upon development, would prove to the world that British Co- 
lumbia, with its 380,000 square miles of territory, was the richest and most 
favored section of British North America, the country was but sparsely set- 
tled. The delegates, upon their arrival at Ottawa, were regarded almost as 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 123 

visitors from one of the heavenly planets, who, having ventured too near the 
edge of their world, had missed their footing and, falling into space, had 
landed at the federal capital. The delegates had the most cordial reception. 
Sir John Macdonald was the Prime Minister and Lord Lisgar was the Vice- 
roy. But Sir John was very ill and when the delegates arrived it was feared 
that his end was in sight. Sir George Cartier was acting premier. He sub- 
mitted the terms to the Executive Council, and while they were being con- 
sidered the delegates were wined and dined by nearly every one of note. 
Lord Lisgar remarked that he was much impressed with the ability of the 
delegates in pressing their claims and their earnestness of purpose. The 
matters embraced in the document were of so momentous a character that 
several weeks elapsed before a final decision was reached. The Dominion 
Government, a year or so before, had purchased from the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany its rights in the Northwest Territory, and were firmly committed to a 
policy of expansion by the construction of a railway to and through that 
country of wonderful agricultural possibilities. The terms, as I have said, 
when they left Victoria, asked only for a wagon-road, and the acting Premier, 
when he informed the House that the ministry had decided to alter the terms 
as submitted by British Columbia, and had guaranteed to construct an un- 
broken line of railway to the tidewaters of British Columbia in ten years, 
startled the Commoners and the whole country. The Liberals, led by Alexan- 
der Mackenzie and Hon. Edward Blake, bitterly opposed the railway as being 
beyond the financial capabilities of the country to build within the specified 
time. It was during the debate on the terms that Mr. Blake characterized 
British Columbia as a " sea of mountains," and declared over and over again 
that a railway built through that " sea " would never pay operating expenses. 
The excitement caused by the introduction of the railway clause was intense 
throughout Canada. Public meetings were held at all large centres and 
denunciatory resolutions passed. But in spite of the most strenuous opposi- 
tion from all quarters, Sir George Cartier stood firm, and after weeks of de- 



124 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

bate the resolutions were finally passed. When &gt; they were about to be read 
for a third time, it is recorded that Sir George Cartier rallied his supporters 
by the shout, "All aboard for the West ! " The summons acted like a bugle 
call on the nerves of his followers and the resolutions went through with a 
rush. 

The terms were amended in another important particular. When the 
delegates left Victoria for Ottawa they were accompanied by a quiet but ob- 
servant gentleman who was instructed to inform the Government that unless 
the clause which withheld responsible government was eliminated from the 
terms, British Columbia would not consent to enter the Confederation. He 
was instructed to tell them that if the agreement should be placed before the 
people without a guarantee of this nature, it would be rejected. The gentle- 
man performed his duties effectually. He enjoyed a personal acquaintance 
with two or three of the Maritime Province Ministers, and so impressed them 
and their colleagues that they consented to alter the terms in that respect and 
give the people full political power. 

After Confederation and the Railway. 

The ratification of the terms in their amended form by the Legislative 
Council was an easy task, and on the 21st day of July, 1871, British Columbia 
entered the Confederation. Mr. Trutch, who had been in the meanwhile 
knighted, and who was now Sir Joseph, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor, 
and he shortly called upon the Hon. Mr. McCreight, a leading barrister, to 
form a Ministry. Mr. McCreight, who had not distinguished himself in 
politics and who was not a supporter of responsible government, accepted the 
task and assumed the portfolio of Attorney-General. He called to his assist- 
ance Mr. A. Rocke Robertson, as Provincial Secretary, Hon. Geo. A. Walkem 
as Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, and Hon. Henry Holbrook as 
President of the Council. It is worthy of remark that Messrs. McCreight, 
Robertson and Walkem were afterwards made justices of the Supreme Court. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 125 

Proclamations were issued defining the districts and calling upon the 
electors to register as voters. The suffrage was universal and voting was 
to be open. Proclamations for the elections followed and for the first time 
in its history British Columbia enjoyed the blessings of a government that 
was responsible to the people instead of to the Crown. The elections resulted 
in the return of a " mixed " house of 25 members. All the ministers were 
returned; but there being no party lines or any well defined political issues, 
and no acknowledged leaders, the first was a sort of happy-go-lucky session, 
in which the fledgling statesmen merely tried their wings, and got ready to soar 
at the next session. The Government was bitterly attacked by Mr. De Cosmos 
and Mr. Thomas Humphreys. Mr. Robson was also a member of the new 
house, but he was not in accord with De Cosmos and Humphreys, although 
he, too, was classed with the opposition. The session of 1872 closed with 
Mr. McCreight and Mr. Robertson thoroughly disgusted with politics and 
politicians. One of the most important measures passed provided for the 
adoption of the Canadian tariff. Another measure adopted the ballot and a 
third denied the franchise to Chinamen and Indians. 

At the opening of the next session, in the fall of 1872, the Government 
met a hostile house. Several members who had supported the Ministry 
throughout the previous session appeared in opposition, and the Ministers had 
not won over a single opponent during the recess. After a few days' sharp 
struggle the Premier informed the House that he could no longer consent 
to occupy his seat on sufferance, and that he had placed his resignation in the 
hands of the Lieutenant-Governor. Sir Joseph was deeply pained at the ig- 
nominious failure of the Ministry in whom he had placed his entire confi- 
dence and the personnel of which he highly approved. He accepted the situ- 
ation with ill-concealed chagrin, and called on Mr. De Cosmos to form a 
government. That gentleman took in Mr. Walkem as Attorney-General, 
Mr. Robert Beaven as Chief Commissioner, Dr. Ash as Provincial Secretary, 
and Mr. W. J. Armstrong as Minister of Finance. 



126 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

To the surprise of all and the indignation of not a few, Mr. Humphreys, 
who had stood loyally by Mr. De Cosmos for several years and fought his 
battles and those of the opposition in and out of season, was omitted from 
the list of Ministers. Mr. Robson, who had fought in the opposition ranks, 
also found his claims ignored. Both gentlemen went into opposition with 
Mr. Smithe and two or three others, but the new Ministry developed great 
strength, and in a house of 25 their opponents numbered only 7. 

While the House was in session at Victoria, events which were destined 
to have an important bearing on the Pacific Province, and, indeed, on the 
whole Dominion, were transpiring at Ottawa. The Macdonald Ministry, in 
consequence of developments that history has recorded as the Pacific scandal, 
resigned, and Lord Dufferin, who had succeeded Lord Lisgar in 1872, called 
upon Hon. Alexander Mackenzie, leader of the Liberals, to form a govern- 
ment. The new Premier experienced no difficulty in completing his cabinet, 
and as soon as arrangements could be perfected he asked his Excellency for 
a dissolution. The request was almost unprecedented, the House being only 
in its second session, but Mr. Mackenzie declared that the House was 
"tainted" and, a dissolution was granted on the 2nd January, 1874. The 
Liberals swept the country, returning with an enormous majority. 

Among the first of the acts of the new Government at Ottawa was an 
endeavor to obtain a relaxation of the terms of union with British Columbia, 
so far as they related to the time-limit for the commencement and completion 
of the railway. The Macdonald Government had agreed to begin railway 
construction within two years after the entrance of British Columbia into 
Confederation. Three years had elapsed and not a tap had been struck, be- 
yond exploratory surveys throughout the Province. Mr. Mackenzie pro- 
posed to substitute for an all-rail construction the water stretches that lie be- 
tween the Northwest and Eastern Canada. Now, it so happened that Mr. 
De Cosmos, the new Premier of British Columbia, was a member of the 
House of Commons, as well as a member of the Provincial Legislature. It 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 127 

was borne in mind that when the terms were before the Legislative Council 
he had only argued for overland communication by wagon road. He was 
suspected of an ambition to enter the Mackenzie cabinet ; and there were not 
wanting some who were ready to accuse him of an intention to so alter the 
terms as to adopt, instead of an all-rail connection, the water-stretch policy 
of Mackenzie. Before the session at Victoria was well begun Mr. De Cos- 
mos left his post in the local House and sailed for Ottawa to take up his 
duties there, leaving his provincial seat vacant. He had always been in 
favor of the retention of the British Columbia tariff, and when he left for 
Ottawa a resolution for the adoption of the Canadian tariff was pending at 
Victoria. The advocates of a low tariff' were in an angry mood at what 
they termed their betrayal. The Premier's opponents made the most of their 
opportunity and the Canadian tariff passed the House. Mr. De Cosmos was 
denounced on all sides for being absent when he should have been present at 
the critical moment of tariff changes. An agitation for the abolishment of 
dual representation, aimed directly at Mr. De Cosmos, was started, and a bill 
was passed to that effect, so that at the following election Mr. De Cosmos, 
who preferred retaining his Ottawa seat, was not eligible to hold a seat in 
the local House, and dropped out of local politics forever. 

The proposition of the Canadian Government to relax the all-rail clause 
and substitute a system of connection by water stretches created alarm 
throughout the Pacific Province. Public meetings were everywhere held, 
bitter speeches were made, and resolutions denouncing the new policy were 
almost unanimously passed. At a meeting convened in the Philharmonic 
hall at Victoria on the 28th of January, 1874, it was announced that the 
Legislature was at that moment holding an evening session for the purpose 
of rushing through an alteration of the railway term in response to the de- 
mand of the Mackenzie Government. Resolutions of an almost revolutionary 
character were carried without a dissenting voice. It was resolved to present 
the resolutions then and there. A crowd of at least two thousand persons 



128 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

rushed across James Bay bridge, which trembled beneath the tread of so many 
feet, and swarmed into the Legislative hall, which they rapidly filled, leaping 
over the bar and occupying the space devoted to honorable members, packing 
the galleries, and hooting, yelling and cursing as they entered. Dr. Trimble, 
who was Speaker, called for order. The noise was deafening and the 
Speaker's voice could not be heard three feet from the throne. He was 
hooted and fists were shaken at him. Then he left the chair, thus suspend- 
ing the sitting. The members of the Ministry hurried from the hall, the 
lights were put out and the crowd retired; but not until the resolutions had 
been placed in the Speaker's hands. The motion to present the resolutions 
at the bar was injudicious, unparliamentary and dangerous. Bloodshed 
might have resulted. As it was, pistols were drawn and clubs flourished, but 
no one was injured. For a few days it was thought that the capital would 
be removed to some town on the Mainland, where the legislators might legis- 
late in quiet and security. The next day an unimportant resolution, which 
did not materially aflfect the terms of union, was passed by the House and 
the incident closed. To illustrate the fickleness of public opinion it is only 
necessary to mention that Mr. De Cosmos a few days later stood for re-elec- 
tion to the Commons in the constituency which on the night of the riot de- 
clared itself ready to hang him, and was successful. 

Mr. Walkem, who succeeded Mr. De Cosmos as Premier, later in the 
year bore a petition to the Queen, asking Her Majesty's Government to en- 
force the railway clause in the agreement with Canada, the Imperial Gov- 
ernment having been a party to the agreement. From that petition sprang 
the Carnarvon terms, which provided, among minor things, for the building 
of a line of railway from Victoria to Nanaimo in satisfaction of past defaults. 
When the Carnarvon terms were laid before the House of Commons Mr. 
Edward Blake opposed them, and Mr. Mackenzie, alarmed at the defection 
of his principal adherent, did not press them. This action, or inaction, on 
the part of the Federal Government again excited the province to a fighting 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 129 

pitch. More meetings were held, and more petitions were sent to Ottawa 

and England. An emissary of the Canadian Government came to Victoria, 

but he submitted terms which were not acceptable to the Go\ernment or the 

people. 

Lord Dufferin's Visit. 

The summer of 1876 was a memorable one. Lord Dufiferin, the Vice- 
roy of Canada, with Lady Dufferin and a numerous suite, arrived at Esqui- 
inalt in a warship. They reached the province via San Francisco, there 
being no railway north of that port at the time. His Excellency landed at 
Esquimalt, where he was received with a royal salute and a deputation of 
citizens and escorted to Government House. Along the line many triumphal 
arches had been erected. They bore various patriotic and welcoming devices, 
but on one of them appeared the inscription, in bold letters, " Carnarvon 
Terms or Separation." This arch spanned Fort street at its intersection with 
Broad. Lord Dufferin, who had been previously apprised of the existence of 
the arch, suggested that if the " S " in " Separation " were changed to an 
" R," making it read " Reparation," he would pass beneath it. If it re- 
mained unaltered he would be driven through another thoroughfare. The 
committee refused to give way, and when the vice-regal carriage reached 
Fort street it left the procession and was driven along Broughton to Douglas 
and thence back to Fort street, thus avoiding the arch altogether. The of- 
fensive arch remained standing for several days, as a. mark of defiance and 
disaffection, and in the meanwhile the Governor-General remained at Gary 
Castle arranging for a stroke which was intended to quiet the turbulent popu- 
lar feeling and put an end to the threats of secession from the Canadian 
Union. Provincial elections had been held in 1875 ^"^^ the Walkem Gov- 
ernment had gone down. Mr. A. C. Elliott, a barrister, and lately police 
magistrate, was called on to form a government. Hon. A. N. Richards had 
succeeded Sir Joseph Trutch as Lieutenant-Governor a few days before Lord 
Dufferin arrived and the Elliott Government was in power. It was a very 



130 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

trying- period for the new Governor and his Premier, with disaffection at 
home and ill-faith at Ottawa to contend with. There was another burning 
question which agitated the constituency. Ever since the province had 
joined the Dominion a fierce fight had been waged between the residents of 
the lower Mainland and those of Vancouver Island for the adoption of a 
line for the railway which would benefit their respective localities. The 
Mainlanders insisted that the proper route was along the Eraser valley, with 
its terminus at Burrard Inlet. The Islanders were equally insistent upon 
the adoption of a line by Bute Inlet, which would make Esquimalt the ter- 
minus. Railway engineers had surveyed both routes, and it was known 
that Marcus Smith, the chief engineer, had reported that the best route was 
through the Rocky Mountains via Yellowhead Pass, thence to Bute Inlet 
(where he proposed to establish a ferry and ultimately to build a bridge), with 
the terminus at Esquimalt. When Lord Dufferin left Ottawa for Victoria 
it was semi-officially announced in the papers that he was the bearer of a 
proclamation that would decide the contest for the route in favor of Bute 
Inlet and Esquimalt. This dispatch, according to Lieutenant Governor 
Trutch, was sent from Government House to the Provincial Secretary's of- 
fice by an official messenger and was handed, so the messenger reported, to 
the Provincial Secretary. From that "day to this the dispatch has not been 
seen. It never reached the public eye. Who destroyed it if it was destroyed, 
who secreted it if it was secreted, who lost it if it was lost, will never be 
known. The parties are all dead. Lord Dufferin always denied all knowl- 
edgment of its fate, although it was admitted that His Excellency handed the 
dispatch to the Lieutenant Governor. The Lieutenant Governor said he 
personally delivered it to the messenger. The Provincial Secretary and the 
Premier were equally emphatic in asserting that it never came into their 
hands. Nine years ago Sir Joseph Trutch told the writer that the proclama- 
tion adopting the Bute Inlet route was carefully read by him and that he 
gave it to the messenger himself. He added that its disappearance was as 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 131 

profound a mystery to him as it was to Lord Dufferin. The Fraser River 
route a year or two later was adopted by the promulgation o£ another proc- 
lamation, and with the removal of four cargoes of steel rails that had been 
landed at Esquimalt and Nanaimo with the view to railway construction on 
the island from Esquimalt to Seymcmr Narrows the battle of the routes 
came to an end. 

It was said at the time that Lord Dufferin was deeply incensed at the 
conduct of the populace when he refused to pass under what he termed 
the " disloyal arch." He was jeered and hooted, and an effort was made 
to turn his horses' heads up Fort Street; but the sober second thought of 
the people came to them before it became necessary for the safety and dig- 
nity of the vice-regal party that they should alight and, declining to accept 
further courtesies, leave Victoria without carrying out the object of their 
visit, which was a heart-to-heart talk with the people, when the whole 
subject of railway construction would be reviewed, and the inaction of the 
Federal authorities in failing to carry out the railway clauses of the agree- 
ment, viz., to begin construction within two years from the date of the entry 
of the province into the Dominion, and the positive refusal of Mr. Mac- 
kenzie to accept the Carnarvon terms after the Colonial Secretary had made 
the award as an arbitrator between the Dominion and British Columbia, 
were to be explained and condoned. It was argued with much force that 
the province had voluntarily accepted the higher Canadian tariff, believing 
that in surrendering its own tariff, which it was entitled to retain until the 
completion of the promised overland railway, it was contributing more 
than its quota to the Dominion Government. The local opposition paper, 
the Standard, was violent in its opposition to the Ottawa Governmeot, and 
while it did not openly approve of the demonstration that occurred at the 
separation arch, it did not disavow it or express regret at the untoward 
occurrence and the insult that was offered to Lord Dufferin. The Colonist, 
organ of the Elliott Government, mildly rebuked the offenders and argued 



L. 



132 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

that the period was a critical one for the interests of the Island, and par- 
ticularly for those of Victoria, which had everything to gain by pursuing 
a moderate course at a time when the selection of a route for the railway 
hung in the balance. A resort to violence and insult might prove most 
disastrous. 

Shortly after the Governor-General's arrival at Victoria, a large pop- 
ular deputation waited upon His Excellency at Government House and pre- 
sented him with an address in which the grievances of the province were 
set forth in temperate, yet forcible words. The Governor-General received 
the deputation cordially and after hearing the address read, informed the 
deputation that he would consider its clauses and give an answer at an early 
date. The vice-regal party visited the Mainland and penetrated the Interior 
as far as the limited steam and stage methods of transportation permitted. 
They were everywhere received with demonstrations of affection and loyalty. 
The addresses presented were devoid of the slightest allusion to the unhappy 
differences that existed between the province and the Dominion; but they 
pressed for the early beginning of railway construction in words so well 
chosen as to elicit praise from His Excellency. No disloyal arches were 
erected and the party returned to Victoria highly pleased with the results 
of their visit to the Mainland. The Victoria deputation was invited to 
Government House some days later. They were received in the billiard 
room. His Excellency, who wore the insignia of his order, was supported 
by his military staff. Lady Dufferin, a charming and beautiful woman, 
stood by his side and remained there during the interview, which lasted about 
two hours. His Excellency considered the address clause by clause, deliver- 
ing the most eloquent and effective address it had ever been the good for- 
tune of the writer to hear. His speech occupied nearly two hours, his 
hearers listening with rapt attention to the glowing words that fell from 
his lips. He reviewed the whole situation, and while admitting that the 
province had been disappointed in one detail of the terms, claimed that 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 133 

every other obligation had been faithfully kept. He attributed the delay 
in carrying out the railway obligation to the financial condition of the country 
and the insufficiency of the surveys, instead of, as had been charged, to 
a deliberate intention on the part of the Dominion to break faith. When he 
considered the part of the address which pressed the right of the province 
to separate from the Dominion, he plainly told them that the desire for a 
dissolution did not extend to the Mainland, where the sentiment was one of 
unbroken loyalty to the Dominion. He pointed out that if the Islanders' 
demand to secede was admitted they would go out alone. The Mainland 
w^ould not accompany them. The Imperial Government would not consent 
to the annexation of Vancouver Island to the United States, and the Island 
would stand in a position of isolation subject to all the political disad- 
vantages of a Crown Colony form of government, from which it had just 
escaped by joining Canada. He then drew a picture of Vancouver Island 
weighed down by debt and in a forlorn condition, with the commerce of 
the empire passing its doors, while the Mainland, which would be connected 
witli the east with a transcontinental railway, prosperous and contented, 
strode on to greatness and power, regarding her ill-advised sister with 
a feeling akin to pity. His Excellency concluded a long oration with an 
eloquent peroration in which he referred to " this glorious province " and its 
prospects in enthusiastic and prophetic language. 

Lord Dufferin bowed to his audience as a signal that the interview was 
at an end, and the deputation withdrew in silence and buried in serious 
thought. Canada's case had been presented as it had never before been 
presented, and the deputation was impressed for the first time with the belief 
that while British Columbia undoubtedly had a grievance Canada had a just 
claim upon the sympathy and consideration of the province for the failure to 
begin railway construction within the time-limit fixed by the terms of union. 

After the departure of Lord Dufferin for home the talk of secession 
grew fainter. His words had set the leaders of the separationists thinking 



134 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and they had at last concluded that separation would be prejudicial to the 
Island's interests, so they confined their agitation within constitutional lim- 
its, and while they continued to press for the Carnarvon terms their language 
was moderate and gave no ofifense at Ottawa. 

Strenuous Politics. 

Mr. Elliott's government, which had gained office after the election 
of 1875, held on during two stormy sessions. They were vigorously opposed 
by Mr. Walkem and Mr. Humphreys, his first lieutenant. Mr. Elliott was 
asserted by his admirers to be an able man ; but he was fond of his ease and 
his books and was no match in debate for his alert and active opponents. He 
simply could not turn his thoughts to politics. They were distasteful to 
him. Most of the time since his arrival in the colonies in 1859 had been 
devoted to discharging his duties as magistrate — first at Yale, then at Lil- 
looet, and afterwards at Victoria. As a magistrate, he was a marked suc- 
cess. As a politician and as leader of the House he was a conspicuous failure, 
and no one was better aware of that fact than himself. His opponents held 
him up to ridicule in the House and to the country. He was denounced as 
a traitor to the province, was told that his government had sold the colony 
to Mackenzie and that in consequence of his supineness and treachery the 
child yet unborn would not live to see the first rail of a transcontinental line 
laid in British Columbia. The session of 1878 was worse for the Govern- 
ment's interests than any that preceded it. In the previous sessions, Mr. 
Elliott had had an unbroken majority of four. In the session of 1878, one 
of his supporters fell off and his majority was reduced to two. From 
the date of that vote, which showed that the solid ranks of the Government 
were broken, the opposition rode roughshod over the ministry. They dis- 
puted the passage of every public measure, opposed the most trivial motions 
when moved by a supporter of the government, and, in reality, " ran the 
House." Matters went from bad to worse. The country was suffering for 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 135 

legislation. Road work was suspended, salaries were unpaid and the treas- 
ury was at a low ebb. A vigorous, militant man at the head of the ministry 
could have saved it with a majority of two; but Mr. Elliott was neither 
one nor the other. Mr. Walkem, with only the casting vote of the speaker, 
had held office in 1875, in spite of all the opposition could do to dislodge 
him. It is true, upon dissolution he was defeated, but he succumbed to the 
demand of the country, not to that of an evenly divided legislature. 

At last Mr. Elliott surrendered. A conference was arranged tetween 
him and the leader of the opposition. The latter demanded, did not ask, 
that the House should be dissolved on the opposition's terms. He offered 
to permit certain money votes and a little necessary legislation to pass. When 
tliat had been done there must l^e a dissolution and an appeal to the electo- 
rate. The premier consented to the humiliating proposition, and an appeal 
to the country resulted in the overthrow of the ministry. Their candidates 
were mostly defeated. At Victoria, the premier and all his supporters were 
beaten by decisive majorities. The other towns, and many of the country 
districts, were equally pronounced in condemnation of the ministry and 
when in September following the House was called together by the new 
premier, Mr. Walkem, a mere handful of opponents, under the guidance of 
Mr. Smithe, confronted him. Mr. Walkem had the wisdom to take Mr. 
Humphreys into his cabinet and, strange to relate, that gentleman sat through 
four sessions and scarcely uttered a word, nor did he introduce a single 
measure. From a hard hitting, forcible debater he became silent as an oyster 
and sat at his desk twirling his thumbs, or lounged through the lobby smok- 
ing Havanas. The year 1878 is remarkable for the fact that during it two 
sessions of the Legislature were held. The new House eagerly voted the 
supplies and some needed legislation, and was prorogued after passing an 
address to the Home Government calling attention to the continued failure 
of the Dominion Government to carry out the terms of union. 

The year 1878 also witnessed the return of the Liberal-Conservative 



136 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

party to power at Ottawa, with Sir John Macclonald as Premier. Lord Duf- 
ferin's term had expired and he had been succeeded by the Marquis of Lome, 
now Duke of Argyle, whose wife is the Princess Louise, daughter of our 
late Queen. One of the first official acts of the new Governor-General was 
to acquaint himself with the nature of the grievances of the people of British 
Columbia, and to set about devising a remedy. He found Sir John Macdon- 
ald disposed to lend a willing ear to the complaints of the Columbians, but 
the Premier was hampered by some of his colleagues, who feared to bring 
down a measure providing for the payment of a large sum of money to 
secure the fulfillment of the Carnarvon agreement. The petition of the 
Walkem Government had been duly received at Ottawa; where it was pigeon- 
holed by the Secretary of State. It reposed in its hiding place for more than 
a year when, no answer or acknowledgment from the Imperial Government 
having been received, an enquiry was set on foot and the precious document 
was brought to light. Another petition was sent to the Governor-General 
and was duly acknowledged. In the meanwhile the Fraser River route was 
proclaimed as the chosen route for the railway, and in the spring of 1880 
railway construction was commenced on the Mainland. The work was 
vigorously prosecuted on the Pacific end; while the C. P. R. pushed ahead 
on the other end. The heavy expenditure consequent upon railway con- 
struction in the province pleased British Columbians generally, but a large 
and influential party was still dissatisfied and pointed out that while the 
Mainland had secured a railway the Island was still denied the section of 
road promised by the Carnarvon terms. It is true that in 1876 Marcus 
Smith had driven stakes near the naval hospital at Esquimalt. These stakes 
he named the " terminal stakes of the transcontinental railway," which ,was 
to have its terminal point there after traversing Yellowhead Pass and the 
Bute Inlet country, but nothing further was done, although the people of 
Victoria and Esquimalt were greatly elated by the stake-driving, which 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 13T 

seemed to be the beginning of the realization of their hopes. The stakes 
remained where Smith drove them for many years and finally rotted away. 

Lord Lorne and the Settlement Act. 

In 1882 it was announced that the Governor-General and his royal con- 
sort would visit the Province. Great preparations were made to receive 
the distinguished visitors, who arrived by the cruiser Comus and landed at 
Esquimalt. They were received with royal salutes and beneath triumphal 
arches were presented with addresses that breathed the loftiest spirit of 
loyalty and regard on the part of the inhabitants. They were escorted to 
Victoria by a number of gentlemen outriders and a large cavalcade of mounted 
citizens, preceded by bands of music. Prominent among the instruments 
were the Scottish bagpipes played upon by a Scotchman from the estate of 
the Duke of Argyle. Government House had been prepared for the recep- 
tion of the august pair and their suite. The Marquis and the Princess re- 
mained in the province for nearly three months. They were feted at every 
place where they visited. All classes vied in paying their respects to the 
Queen's daughter and her distinguished husband. Balls, dinners and at 
homes and riding and driving parties were of frequent occurrence and all 
classes were charmed by the simple and unaffected manner of the visitors 
and the cordial and unconventional way in which every one who approached 
them was received and entertained. The Princess in conversation always 
referred to the Queen as " My Mother," and to the Marquis as " My Hus- 
band." 

His Excellency before leaving Ottawa had informed himself as to the 
unhappy relations of the province with the Dominion and although railway 
construction on the Mainland had begun under favorable auspices the Car- 
narvon Terms had not been carried out, and the |x&gt;pular discontent on the 
Island, though deep, was not loud as on the previous occasion. During the 
six years that had elapsed since the visit of Lord Dufferin, Hon. Mr. Rich- 



138 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ards had retired from Government House and had been succeeded by Sen- 
ator Cornwall as Lieutenant Governor. To the local government, of which 
Hon. Mr. Beaven was Premier, Mr. Walkem having been elevated to the 
Supreme Court Bench, the Marquis of Lome expressed a desire to mediate 
and, if possible, restore the pleasant relations that existed between the fed- 
eral and provincial governments during the first few years after the entrance 
of the Province into the Confederation. The presence of a Conservative 
Government at Ottawa was believed to be a happy augury for the success of 
the peace negotiations, which were immediately opened. The local govern- 
ment was found to be well disposed towards an arrangement that would end 
the warfare, and the Ottawa Government expressed a similar disposition. 
The Marquis of Lome had met the Hon. Robt. Dunsmuir, then member 
of the local house for Nanaimo, and was greatly impressed with his earnest- 
ness and ability. Mr. Dunsmaiir, besides, was a man of great wealth, and 
possessed a progressive nature. He had discovered and developed the Wel- 
lington coal mines and was an ardent advocate of the Carnarvon Terms. 
Preliminaries having been arranged, the Governor-General addressed him- 
self to Mr. Dunsmuir as the one man in the province who might be willing 
to take the contract for building the line to Nanaimo. Mr. Dunsmuir recog- 
nized the stupendous character of the undertaking. In his earlier inter- 
views with the Marquis, he absolutely refused to have anything to do with 
the contract. He had made his fortune, he said, after many years of toil 
and hardship, and why should he imperil it by entering upon an enterprise 
which presented many obstacles to success? The Marquis persisted, how- 
ever, and at last, Mr. Dunsmuir consented to undertake the task, but only 
upon terms that would be acceptable to Messrs. Crocker and Huntington, 
of the Central Pacific syndicate of capitalists. Those gentlemen consented 
to take half interest in the scheme on conditions that have since been de- 
nounced as onerous and unparalleled in the history of any country, though 
similar terms had been rejected by other capitalists in the United States 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 139 

and Great Britain. The principal features of the concession were: Free 
gift of nearly two millions of acres of land on the Island, extending from 
the Straits of Fnca to Crown Mountain in the Comox district. This land 
was to be free from taxation forever or until alienated by the Company. 
The syndicate also asked for a cash subsidy of $750,cxx) to be paid upon 
the completion of the line, which would be some eighty miles in length. The 
land grant carried with it all minerals, fossils and substances of whatsoever 
nature in, on, or under the land. It was contended at the time that the 
grant carried with it the precious as well as the base metals. This point was 
subsequently submitted to the Privy Council, by whom it was dedided 
that the deed that conveyed the land not having mentioned the precious 
metals they had not passed with the land. An old decision of Lord Bacon's 
was quoted by the Privy Council to show that the royal metals (gold and 
silver) should have been particularized, and that the words " all minerals 
and substances of whatever nature " did not include the royal metals. Is 
it not strange that nearly a quarter of a century after the agreement was 
made with the syndicate a controversy has arisen over the water rights con- 
tained in the belt, and that the Privy Council may again be appealed to before 
a satisfactory settlement can be reached? 

The Marquis of Lome and the Princess remained in the Province until 
December, 1882, a period of about three months. They were delighted with 
the climate, the people, the resources and the scenery. The Princess passed 
much time in sketching the grand views that can be seen from Government 
House and vicinity, while the Marquis visited the Interior and afterwards 
took a spin on the Government steamer along the coasts of the Island and 
the Mainland. The visitors opened agricultural fairs at Victoria, New 
Westminster, and Kamloops and were prominent at several private func- 
tions. They held a reception in the Parliament Buildings and gave many 
dinner parties, winding up a season of gaiety with a ball at Government 
House. It is worthy of remark that during the stay of the Marquis and the 



140 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Princess there was neither wind nor rain. Regular Queen's weather set in 
with their coming and continued until after their departure, a happy augury 
of a peaceful outcome of negotiations with both governments. 

Upon returning to Ottawa the Marquis laid before the Government a 
draft of the treaty of peace which he had provisionally arranged at Victoria. 
His Excellency found the Ottawa Government anxious for a settlement, and 
willing to do all in their power to close the breach; but they could not see 
how the cash gift of $750,000 could be explained to the satisfaction of their 
followers. The Smithe Government had in the meanwhile come into power 
at Victoria, and after long negotiations an arrangement was made which 
it was believed could be carried through both Parliaments. It was agreed 
that in consideration of a gift of $750,000 the Province should cede to the 
Dominion Government two million acres of land on the Island, and in addi- 
tion convey three million five hundred thousand acres in rectangular blocks 
in the Peace River country in the northeast corner of the Province and 
adjacent to the Northwest territory. The tract was valued then at 22 cents 
per acre, the Dominion Government, in return for these concessions, to se- 
cure the construction of the Island railway, and with Imperial assistance to 
complete the dry-dock at Esquimalt. This dry-dock, it must be stated, had 
been commenced as a provincial undertaking in 1874, but work had been 
suspended for want of funds. The late Sir Alexander Campbell, the Min- 
ister of Justice of the Dominion cabinet, came to Victoria and had many 
interviews with Mr. Smithe and his colleagues. The Settlement Act was 
framed at last on the basis above stated. At their succeeding sessions the 
respective parliaments ratified the agreements and both railway and dry- 
dock were completed in due course. 

It would be interesting to know at what figure the Dominion Govern- 
ment now would hold the three million five hundred thousand acres of land 
that were conveyed to them under the Settlement Act and which in 1884 
were deemed to be of so little importance that 22 cents an acre were consid- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 141 

ered an extreme value. The opposition at Ottawa, when discussing the Act, 
declared that the lands were perfectly valueless, being part of the " sea of 
mountains " which Mr. Blake had eloquently but incorrectly named in his 
speech, when arguing against the admission of British Columbia on the 
original terms. In the British Columbia Legislature, the opposition pro- 
tested against the grant on the ground that they were of immense prospective 
value. If the land is arable its present value to-day is $5 , per acre, or 
$17,500,000 for the whole tract, a sum sufficient to pay the debt of the 
Province and leave a handsome surplus for public improvements. 

The Settlement Act having been finally passed by the Ottawa and Vic- 
toria Parliaments both governments proceeded to carry out its provisions in 
good faith. The island railway was built by Mr. Dunsmuir and his asso- 
ciates within the time set for its completion. The contract for the comple- 
tion of the Esquimau dry-dock was awarded in 1885 to Larkin &amp; Connolly, 
and the work was finished in 1888, in a very satisfactory manner, the Im- 
perial Government sharing the cost of the construction with the Dominion 
Government in consideration of Her Majesty's ships being docked free of 
charge. The building of these works inspired the people of the island with 
confidence in the future of the capital city. Population poured in, business 
advanced, and real estate increased in value, and numerous buildings of an 
important character were undertaken. The period from 1886 to 1892 was 
one of unexampled prosperity for the inhabitants in and about Victoria, and 
generally on Vancouver Island and throughout the province. In 1889 a land 
boom set in, and lasted for about three years. Property continued to rise, 
and many sales were effected that gratified buyers and sellers. Business of 
the ports as indicated by the customs house was doubled and every branch 
of industry showed a vast improvement over previous years. The outlook 
was favorable everywhere, and the construction of a system of electric tram- 
ways through the streets of Vancouver and Victoria, with connecting lines 
to the naval station at-Esquimalt and New Westminster contributed largely 



142 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

to the general prosperity and added to the value of realty, increasing public 
confidence in the stability and permanency of the towns and cities. 

Advent of the C. P. R. 

In 1886 the C. P. R. reached Port Moody and a considerable town 
sprang up at that place which proved, however, to be only a temporary ter- 
minus. In July, 1886, the townsite of Vancouver was swept as clean as 
the back of a man's hand by a fierce fire which totally destroyed nearly every 
building there. In two hours the flourishing young town was reduced to a 
pile of hot ashes and glowing embers. But the pluck of the people was un- 
daunted. Fire might destroy their town, but it could not burn out their 
faith in its destiny. Before the ruins had cooled — at daylight next morn- 
ing, in fact — two new buildings were in course of erection, and before night- 
fall lots for the accommodation of half a dozen other buildings were being 
cleared of ruins. So the work of reconstruction went on, till in the course 
of a few weeks there was scarcely a scar caused by the late conflagration 
visible. 

In the local legislature during the session of 1887 the provincial gov- 
ernment introduced a bill to authorize the subsidizing of the C. P. R. with 
6,000 acres of crown lands in consideration of their extending their line to 
Vancouver and making that city the final termius of the road. The proposi- 
tion was vigorously combated. It was argued that the company in its own 
interests must bring the road to Vancouver without a subsidy. The contest 
was long and bitter, but the Government triumphed with the modest majority 
of three, and the bill was passed. The acres conveyed to the company by 
the bill are now estimated to be worth several millions of dollars. Besides 
the government concession the railway company demanded and received one- 
third of the land owned by the syndicate of Victorians who had bought much 
of the_ townsite at bottom prices and were holding the lots for an enormous 
advance on cost price in anticipation of railway extension. The company 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 143 

lost no time in earning their subsidies and in May, 1887, the scream of a 
locomotive whistle announced the arrival of the first through train from 
Montreal. The rejoicing of the Vancouverians was great, and the popular 
demonstrations at the Terminal city were such as befitted the great occasion. 
But while Vancouver rejoiced the people of Port Moody mourned in sack- 
cloth and ashes over the destruction of their hopes and the certain decay of 
their little town, which had just begun to grow, when it was decided to carry 
the line eleven miles further down the inlet. 

Later Politics. 

The political changes since the passing of the Settlement Act have been 
many. Mr. Smithe held office from 1883 to 1887, when he died, just after 
carrying the country at the general elections. A. E. B. Davie succeeded him 
as Premier, and he died two years and three months later. John Robson 
came after A. E. B. Davie as Premier, in 1889, and he died in London, Eng- 
land, in 1892. Theodore Davie was the next Premier. In March, 1895, 
he resigned, having been appointed Chief Justice of British Q)lumbia in place 
of Sir Matthew Baillie Beghie, who had died a short time before. Dur- 
ing the administration of Hon. Theodore Davie, and while Hon. Edgar 
Dewdney was Lieutenant Governor the magnificent buildings at James Bay 
were begun, and during the administration of Hon. Mr. Turner, who suc- 
ceeded Mr. Davie as Premier, the beautiful pile was completed and opened 
with great pomp and ceremony by Lieutenant Governor Mclnnes. Mr. 
Davie did not long enjoy his judicial honors, for he died in 1898 after an 
illness of a few months' duration. 

In the fall of 1898 a remiarkable political event startled the province and 
the Dominion. Lieutenant Governor Mclnnes dismissed the Turner Gov- 
ernment while the result of the general elections was still in doubt, and while 
two seats remained to be heard from. Then he called on the former Premier, 
Mr. Beaven, to form a government; but after a week of industrious effort, 



144 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

that gentleman announced his inability to form a cabinet, and Mr. C. A. 
Semlin, leader of the opposition in the previous house, was asked to try 
his hand at cabinet making. Mr. Semlin succeeded in forming a govern- 
ment, and the house met the following winter, with Mr. Joseph Martin hold- 
ing the portfolio of Attorney General. In July, 1899, Mr. Martin resigned 
from the cabinet at the request of the Premier, and the next session he went 
into opposition. The Semlin government was defeated by a majority of 
one in the session of 1900, and the Governor just before prorogation re- 
quested Mr. Martin to form a ministry. Mr. Martin consented, although 
he had no following in the House. When the Lieutenant Governor entered 
the chamber to prorogue it, every member with the exception of Mr. Martin 
rose and left the hall and the speech from the throne was read to empty 
benches, Mr. Martin alone remaining. The scene was unequalled in a Brit- 
ish legislature. It was an extreme measure, but it was deemed necessary to 
mark popular disapprobation of the course of the Lieutenant Governor in 
calling upon a gentleman with not one political friend in the House. After 
prorogation Mr. Martin formed a government of five, only one of whom had 
had any political experience and that in another province. An appeal to 
the country followed a few months later, and jyir. Martin was hopelessly 
defeated. Mr. James Dunsmuir was then requested to form a government. 
He succeeded in getting a ministry together and with a large majority of 
the elected members, signed a round robin addressed to the Governor General 
asking him to remove Mr. Mclnnes from office in consequence of his un- 
constitutional act in calling upon Mr. Martin to form a government. The 
Lieutenant Governor was dismissed from office on the 21st of June, 1900. 
He was succeeded by Sir Henri Joly de Lotbiniere. After the session of 
1902, Mr. Dunsmuir resigned and the Lieutenant Governor called upon Col. 
Prior, who, meanwhile, had resigned from the Dominion House of Com- 
mons, to form a government. Col. Prior having been elected to fill a vacancy 
in the Victoria city representation caused by the retirement of Mr. Turner. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 145 

He succeeded in forming a ministry, but after a turbulent session he was 
dismissed from office by the Lieutenant Governor. Hon. R. McBride was 
next asked to form a government. By this time party Hnes had been de- 
cided upon for the first time in provincial politics. Mr. McBride formed a 
Gjnservative Government, and was returned to the house with a working 
majority. He and his ministers are still in power.

CHAPTER VIII. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE MAINLAND. 

The history of the Mainland of British Columbia began with the dis- 
covery of gold in 1857. Prior to that it was part of the Indian Territory 
of British North America, an area of uncertain metes and bounds over which 
the Hudson's Bay Company had exclusive trading rights, which had been 
exercised by that corporation in what is now the province of British Colum- 
bia since the year 1821, the date of the union of the rival fur companies. 
Shortly after this the company surrendered the grant of 1821 to the Imperial 
Crown, and obtained a new crown grant on the 30th of May, 1838, of the 
exclusive trade with the Indians of all those parts of North America to the 
northward of the lands and territories belonging to the United States of 
America, not forming part of any British provinces or of any lands or terri- 
tories belonging to the United States or to any European government or 
power, but subject to certain provisions. These provisions referred to the 
protection of the Indians — ^the regulation of the liquor traffic and the moral 
and religious improvement of the natives, to certain regulations as to trade 
monopoly by the company, to the right of the Crown to the establishment of 
colonies or provinces, or the annexation of any part of the territory to exist- 
ing provinces or colonies, or for the erection of any form of civil government 
that the Crown might deem necessary 6r desirable ; and also the power of 
the Crown to revoke the whole or any part of the Hudson's Bay Company 
grant within the territory designated. 

In accordance with the rights under the charter in question the com- 
pany had established forts or trading posts at a number of points in the in- 
terior and on the coast of the mainland. Among these were: Alexandria 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 147 

and Chilcotin in 1821, Babine in 1822, Langley in 1827, (old) Fort Simp- 
son in 1831, Simpson in 1834, Dease in 1838, Stickine about the same time, 
Hope in 1847 ^"^ Yale in 1848. Kamloops and a number of other posts 
had been established prior to that by the Northwest Company, which were 
acquired by the Hudson's Bay Company by the terms of the union in 1821. 
Through all this vast territory the Company had exercised practical and un- 
disputed sovereignty, and established a wonderful system of communication, 
whereby the product of the chase in furs obtained by purchase from the In- 
dians were conveyed to the company's depots for final export to Lx)ndon by 
ships, and the necessary supplies for trading purposes and the use of the 
servants of the company were returned. With the discovery of gold and the 
subsequent rush of the miners from all parts of the world the sovereignty of 
the Hudson's Bay Company came suddenly to an end, and the crown exer- 
cised its power to revoke the charter of rights to the company, and to estab- 
lish colonies, and erect civil government throughout their extent. In 1849, 
the Crown had erected Vancouver Island into a colony, with provision for at 
least a semblance of government, although the grant of the island to the com- 
pany had been made on conditions of colonization. It was an empire within 
an empire, so to speak. That anomalous relation came to an end, ten years 
later, as the result of an investigation before a select committee of the Im- 
perial House of Commons. The separate colony of British Columbia came 
into existence on the 19th of November, 1858, with James Douglas, after- 
wards Sir James, as governor. In the interim, that is, between the time of 
the rush of miners up the Fraser and the formation of the colony, he had gov- 
erned the country by proclamation, without authority, it is true, as he had 
no jurisdiction beyond the Island of Vancouver, but it was not a time to 
cavil about nice distinctions; and the Colonial Secretary, while cognizant of 
the irregularity of the proceedings, approved the action he had taken to pre- 
serve order and establish a temporary form of government. 



us BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Governor Douglas's Instructions. 

Lord Lytton, acting for the Imperial Government, lost no time in in- 
structing Douglas as to the course he should pursue, and the wisdom of his 
suggestions will be recognized today almost as fully as at the time when they 
were penned. They bear all the ear marks of enlightened statesmanship for 
which His Lordship was distinguished, and were a constitution for the new 
colony in embryo, and a charter of liberties for the new commonwealth on 
the Pacific Coast, the extremest outpost of the British Empire. A few ex- 
tracts from these dispatches will best convey an understanding of the spirit 
in which they were framed, and which wisely actuated the British authorities 
at the time, so different from the policy which had emanated from Downing 
Street on many previous occasions when dealing with colonies in British 
America. Writing on the i6th of July to Governor Douglas, Lord Lytton 
advised him of the steps that were being taken to organize a colony and 
establish civil government. Among the instructions to Douglas were the 
following : 

" It is proposed to appoint a governor with a salary of at least £i,ooo 
per annum, to be paid for the present out of a parliamentary vote. And it 
is the desire of Her Majesty's Government to appoint you at once to that 
office, on the usual terms of a governor's appointment, namely, for six years 
at least, your administration of that office continuing to merit the approval 
of Her Majesty's Government; this government to be held, for the present, 
in conjunction with your separate commission as governor of Vancouver 
Island. With regard to the latter, I am not at this moment able to specify 
the terms as to the salary on which it may ultimately be held, but your in- 
terests would, of course, not be overlooked. 

" The legal connection of the Hudson's Bay Company with Vancouver 
Island will shortly be severed by the resumption by the crown of the grant 
of the soil. And their legal rights on the continent opposite terminate in 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 149 

May next, at all events by the expiry of her license, if Her Majesty should 
not be advised to terminate it sooner on the establishment of the new colony. 

" It is absolutely necessary, in their view, that the administration of 
the government, both of Vancouver Island and of the mainland opposite, 
should be entrusted to an officer or officers entirely unconnected with the 
company. I wish, therefore, for your distinct statement, as early as you 
can afford it, whether you are willing, on receiving the appointment which 
is thus offered to you, to give up, within as short a time as may be practicable, 
all connection which you may have with that company, either as its servant, 
or a shareholder, or in any other capacity. 

" I make this proposal without discussing at present the nature and ex- 
tent of your actual connections with that company, but with the acquiescence 
of the governor of the company, who has seen this dispatch. In the mean- 
time, and awaiting your answer, it is my present intention (liable only to be 
altered by what may transpire in future advices from yourself) to issue a 
commission to you as governor ; but you will fully understand that unless 
you are prepared to assure me that all connection between yourself and the 
company is terminated, or in course of speedy termination, you will be re- 
lieved by the appointment of a successor. 

" I make this proposal briefly and without unnecessary preface, being 
lully assured that you will understand, on the one hand, that Her Majesty's 
Government are very anxious to secure your services, if practicable; but on 
the other that it is quite impossible that you should continue to serve at once 
the Crown and the company, when their respective rights and interests may 
possibly diverge, and when, at all events, public opinion will not allow of 
such a connection." 



" As it is a matter of considerable importance, both to Her Majesty's 
Government and yourself, that there should be a perfect understanding as 
to the terms on which, if you should so decide, you would assume office un- 



150 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

der Imperial authority. I think it right to state, as it was omitted on the last 
occasion, that beside relinquishing, directly or indirectly, all connection with 
the Hudson's Bay Company, it will be indispensable to apply that condition 
equally to any interest you may possess in the Puget Sound Company. 

" It is most probable that you have understood the offer contained in 
my confidential dispatch of the i6th instant in that sense, but I think it bet- 
ter now to guard against any possible misconception on the subject by this 
additional explanation. It is due to you to add that if, after reflection, you 
should entertain the persuasion that it will either not conduce to the public 
interests or your own to exchange your present position for that of governor 
of British Columbia, the ability which you have displayed whilst holding 
the office of gx)vernor of Vancouver Island will not escape the recollection 
of Her Majesty's Government, should it be your wish, on the expiration of 
the Hudson's Bay Company's license next year, to enter into the service of 
the Crown in the colonies." 



" I need hardly observe that British Columbia, for by that name the 
Queen has been graciously pleased to observe that the country should be 
known, stands on a very different footing from many of our colonial settle- 
ments. Tliey possess the chief elements of success in lands, which af- 
forded safe though not very immediate sources of prosperity. This territory 
combines in a remarkable degree, the advantage of fertile lands, fine timber, 
adjacent harbors, rivers, together with rich mineral products. These last, 
which have led to the large immigration of which all accounts speak, furnish 
the government with the means of raising a revenue which will at once de- 
fray the expenses of an establishment. * * * ]y[y own views lead me to 
think that moderate duties on beer, wine, spirits and other articles usually sub- 
ject to taxation would be preferable to the imposition of licenses ; and I con- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 151 

fidently expect that from these sources a large and an immediate revenue 
may be derived. 

" The disposal also of public lands, and especially of town lots, for 
which I am led to believe there will be a great demand, will afford a rapid 
means of obtaining funds applicable to the general purposes of the colony. 
You will, probably, at an early period take steps for deciding upon a site for 
a seaport town. But the question of how a revenue can best be raised in 
this new country depends so much on local circumstances, upon which you 
possess such superior means of forming a judgment to myself, that I neces- 
sarily, but at the same time willingly, leave the decision upon it to you, with 
the remark that it will be prudent on your part and expedient to ascertain 
the general sense of the immigrants upon a matter of so much importance. 
Before I leave this part of the subject, I must state that whilst the Imperial 
Parliament will cheerfully lend its assistance in the early establishment of 
this new colony, it will exj^ect that the colony will be self-supporting as 
soon as possible. You will keep steadily in view that it is the desire of this 
country that representative institutions and self-government should prevail 
in British Columbia, when by the growth of a fixed population, materials for 
these institutions shall be known to exist; and to that object, you must from 
the commencement aim and shape all your policy. 

" A party of Royal Engineers will be dispatched to the colony im- 
mediately. It will devolve upon them to survey those parts of the country 
which may be considered most suitable for settlement, to mark out allotments 
of land for public purposes, to suggest a site for the seat of government, to 
point out where roads should be made, and to render you such assistance 
as may be in their power, on the distinct understanding, however, that this 
force .is to be maintained at the Imperial cost for only a limited period, and 
that if required afterwards, the colony will have to defray the expense there- 
of. I have to add, that I am of the opinion that it will be reasonable and 
proper that the expense of the survey of all allotments of land to private in- 



152 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

dividuals should be included in the price which the purchaser will have to 
pay for his property. 

" I shall endeavor to secure, if possible, the services of an officer in com- 
mand of the engineers who will be capable of reporting on the value of the 
mineral resources. This force is sent for scientific and practical purposes, 
and not solely for military objects. As little display as possible should, 
therefore, be made of it. Its mere appearance, if prominently obtruded, 
might serve to irritate, rather than appease the mixed population which will 
Idc collected in British Columbia. It should be remembered that your real 
strength lies in the conviction of the immigrants that their interests are 
identical with those of the government, which should be carried on in har- 
mony with, and by means of the people of the country. 

" As connected with this subject, it may be convenient to you to know 
that I contemplate sending out an experienced inspector of police to assist 
you in the formation of a police force. You should consequently lose no 
time in considering how that force may be org-anized. It must be derived 
from people on the spot, who will understand that for their preservation from 
internal disturbances, they must rely solely on themselves, and not on the 
military. I cannot permit myself to doubt, that in a matter so essential to 
the common security of all, you will meet with the ready concurrence of 
the community, and that you will act for their interests in a manner which 
shall be proper and conformable to their general sentiments. 

" I have to enjoin upon you to consider the best and most humane means 
of dealing with the native Indians. The feelings of this country would be 
strongly opposed to the adoption of any arbitrary or oppressive measures 
towards them. At this distance, and with the imperfect means of knowledge 
which I possess, I am reluctant to offer, as yet, any suggestion as to the 
prevention of affrays between the Indians and the immigrants. This ques- 
tion is of so local a character that it must be solved by your knowledge and 
experience, and I commit it to you, in the full persuasion that you will pay 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 153 

every regard to the interests of the natives which an enlightened humanity 
can suggest. Let me not omit to observe, that it should be an invariable 
condition, in all bargains or treaties with the natives for the cession of lands 
possessed by them, that subsistence should be supplied to them in some other 
shape, and above all, that it is the earnest desire of Her Majesty's Govern- 
ment that your early attention should be given to the best means of diffusing 
the blessings of the Christian religion and of civilization among the natives. 
" I wish to impress upon you the necessity of seeking, by all legitimate 
means, to secure the confidence and good-will of the immigrants, and to ex- 
hibit no jealousy whatever of Americans or other foreigners who may enter 
the country. You will remember that the country is destined for free in- 
stitutions at the earliest moment. In the meanwhile it will be advisable 
for you to ascertain what Americans resorting to the diggings enjoy the 
most influence or popular esteem, and you should open with them a frank 
and friendly communication as to the best means of preserving order and 
securing the interests and peace of the colony. It may be deserving of your 
consideration whether there may not be found already amongst the immi- 
grants, both British and foreign, some persons whom' you could immediately 
form into a council of advice ; men whom, if an elective council were ultimate- 
ly established in the colony, the immigrants themselves would be likely to 
elect, and who might be able to render you valuable assistance until the ma- 
chinery of government were perfected, and you were in possession of the 
instructions which the Queen will be pleased to issue for your guidance. I 
shall hope to receive, at an early period, your views on these and other topics 
of importance which are likely to present themselves for your decision in 
the difficult circum.stances in which you are placed, and I request you to be 
assured, on the part of Her Majesty's Government, that I shall be most ready 
to afford you every assistance in my power." 



154 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

" There has not been time to furnish you by this mail with the order- 
in-council, commission, and instruction to yourself as governor, which are 
necessary in order to complete your legal powers. You will, nevertheless, 
continue to act during the brief interval before their arrival as you have hith- 
erto done, as the authorized representative of Her Majesty's Government in 
tlie territory of British Columbia, and take, without hesitation, such steps as 
you may deem absolutely necessary for the government of the territory, and 
as are not repugnant to the principles of British law; but you will do so in 
conformity with the directions which I transmit to you on several subjects 
by my dispatches of even date herewith, and in such others as you may re- 
ceive from me." 



" I have to acknowledge the very important series of dispatches (num- 
bers 24 to 29 inclusive, from June loth to July ist, 1858), showing the 
manner in which you have continued to administer the government of the 
territory in which the recent discoveries of gold have taken place, and de- 
tailing the extraordinary course of events in that quarter. Her Majesty's 
Government feel that the difficulties of your position are such as courage, 
judgment and familiarity with the resources of the country and character 
of the people can alone overcome. They feel also that minute instructions 
conveyed from this distance, and founded on an imperfect knowledge, are 
very liable to error and misunderstanding. On some points, however, you 
have yourself asked for approval and instructions; on others it is absolutely 
necessary that the views of Her Majesty's Government should be made clear 
to you. 

" As to the steps which you have already taken, I approve of the appoint- 
ments which you have made and reported of revenue officers, Mr. Hicks and 
Mr. Travaillot, of Mr. Perrier as justice of the peace, and of Mr. Young as 
gold commissioner. I approve, also, as a temporary measure, of the steps 
which you have taken in regard to the surveying department, but I have it in 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 155 

contemplation to send to the colony a head of that department from England. 

" I propose selecting in this country some person for the office of collect- 
or of customs, and shall send you also, at the earliest moment, an officer 
authorized to act as judge, and who, I trust, as the colony increases in im- 
portance, may be found competent to fill with credit and weight the situation 
of chief justice. I await your intimations as to the wants and means of the 
colony, in this sudden rise of social institutions in a country hitherto so wild, 
in order to select such law advisers as you may deem the condition and prog- 
ress of immigration more immediately require. And it is my wish that 
all legal authorities connected with the government should be sent from home, 
and thus freed from every suspicion of local partialities, prejudices and in- 
terests. 

'' I highly approve of the steps you have taken, as reported by yourself, 
with regard to the Indians. It is in the execution of this very delicate and 
important portion of your duties that Her Majesty's Government especially 
rely on your knowledge and experience obtained in your long service under 
the Hudson's Bay Company. You may in return rely on their support in the 
execution of such reasonable measures as you may devise for the protection 
of the natives, the regulation of their intercourse with the whites, and when- 
ever such work may be commenced, their civilization. In what way the fur 
trade with the Indians may henceforth be carried on with the most safety, 
and with due care to save them from the demoralizing bribes of ardent spirits, 
I desire to know your views before you make any fixed regulations. No 
regulations giving the slightest preference to the Hudson's Bay Company 
will in future be admissible, but possibly, with the assent of the whole com- 
munity, licenses for Indian trade, impartially given to all who would embark 
in it, might be a prudent and not unpopular precaution. 

" I approve of the measures which you have taken for raising a revenue 
by customs, and authorize their continuance. I approve also of your con- 
tinuing to levy license fees for mining purposes, requesting you, however, 



156 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

to adapt the scale of these fees to the general acquiescence of adventurers, 
and leaving it to your judgment to change this mode of taxation (as, for in- 
stance, into an export duty), if it shall appear on experience to be inadvis- 
able to continue it. But on this head I must give you certain cautions. In 
the first place, no distinction must be made between foreigners and British 
subjects as to the amount per head of the license fee required (nor am I aware 
that you have proposed to do so). In the second place, it must be made 
perfectly clear to everyone, that this license fee is levied, not in regard to 
any supposed rights of the Hudson's Bay Company, but simply in virtue of 
the prerogative of the Crown (now confirmed by the Act of Parliament 
transmitted to you, if this was necessary) to raise revenue as it thinks proper, 
in return for the permission to derive profits from the minerals on Crown 
lands. 

" Further, with regard to these supposed rights of the Hudson's Bay 
Company, I must refer you, in even stronger terms, to the cautions already 
conveyed to you by my former dispatches. The Hudson's Bay Company 
have hitherto had an exclusive right to trade with Indians in the Fraser River 
territory, but they have had no other right whatever. They have had no 
rights to exclude strangers. They have had no rights of government, or of 
occupation of the soil. They have had no right to prevent or interfere with 
any kind of trading, except with the Indians alone. But to render all mis- 
conceptions impossible. Her Majesty's Government has determined on re- 
voking the company's license (which would itself have expired in next May) 
as regards British Columbia being fully authorized to do so, by the terms of 
the license itself, whenever a new colony is constituted. 

" The company's private property will be protected, in common with 
that of all Her Majesty's subjects, but they have no claim whatever for com- 
pensation for the loss of their exclusive trade, which they only possessed sub- 
ject to the right of revocation. The instrument formally revokyig the 
license will shortly be forwarded to you. * * * ^^^ immense resources 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 157 

which the information which reaches England every day and is confirmed 
with such authority by your last dispatch, assures me that the colony pos- 
sesses, and the facility for immediate use of those resources for the purposes 
of revenue, will at once free the Mother Country from those expenses which 
are adverse to the policy of all healthful colonization. * * * The most 
important works to which, the local revenue can be applied seem to be police, 
public works to facilitate landing and traveling, payment of the absolutely 
necessary officers, and above all, surveying. But your own local judgment 
must mainly decide. You will render accurate accounts to me both of re- 
ceipts and expenditure, and you will probably find it necessary shortly to ap- 
point a treasurer, which will be a provisional appointment. 

" You are fully authorized to take such measures as you can for the 
transmission of letter and levying postage. It appears by your despatch that 
the staff of surveyors you have engaged are at present employed on Van- 
couver Island, the soil of which is as yet held under the expiring license 
of the Hudson's Bay Company; but it is British Columbia which now de- 
mands and indeed may almost absorb the immediate cares of its governor, 
and your surveyor may at once prepare the way for the arrival of the sur- 
veyor-general appointed from hence, and of the sappers and miners who 
will be under his orders. 

" I now come to the important subject of future government. It is 
p&lt;..ssible (although on this point I am singularly without information) that 
the operations of the gold diggers will be to a considerable extent suspended 
during winter, and that you will therefore have some amount of leisure to 
consider the permanent prospects of the colony and the best mode of admin- 
istering its affairs. 

" You will be empowered both to govern and to legislate of your own 
authority; but you will distinctly understand that this is a temporary meas- 
ure only. It is the anxious wish of her Majesty's Government that popular 
institutions, without which they are convinced peace and order cannot long 



158 . BRITISH COLUMBIA 

prevail, should be established with as little delay as practicable; and until 
an Assembly can be organized (which may be whenever a permanent popu- 
lation, however small, is established on the soil), I think, as I have already 
stated in a former despatch, that your best course will protebly be to form 
some kind of temporary council, calling in this manner to your aid such 
persons as the miners themselves may place confidence in. 

" You will receive additional directions along with your commission, 
when forwarded to you; and I have embodied in a separate despatch those 
regarding the very important question of the disposal of land. 

" Aware of the immediate demand on your time and thoughts connected 
with the pressing question of immigration to the gold mines, I do not wish 
to add unnecessarily to the burden of duties so onerous; but as yet, our 
Department has been left singularly in ignorance of much that should enter 
into considerations of general policy, and on which non-official opinions are 
constantly volunteered. Probably, amongst the persons you are now em- 
ploying, and in whose knowledge and exactitude you can confide, you might 
find someone capable of assisting, under your superintendence, in furnish- 
ing me, as early as possible, with a report of the general capacities of the 
harbors of Vancouver, — of their advantages and defects; of the mouth of 
Fraser River, as the site of the entry into British Columbia, apart from the 
island; of the probabilities of a coal superior for steam purposes to that oi 
the island, which may be found in the mainland of British Columbia; and 
such other information as may guide the British Government to the best 
and readiest means of developing the various and the differing resources 
which have so strangely been concealed for ages, which are now so sud- 
denly brought to light, and which may be destined to effect, at no very 
distant period, a marked and permanent change in the commerce and navi- 
gation of the known world. The officers now engaged in the maritime sur- 
vey will probably render great assistance to yourself and to her Majesty's 
Government in this particular." 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 159 

" With regard to the very important subject of the disposal of land, 
you are authorized to sell land merely wanted for agricultural purposes, 
whenever a demand for it shall arise, at such upset price as you may think 
advisable. I believe that a relatively high upset price has many advantages ; 
but your course must, in some degree, be guided by the price at which such 
land is selling in neighboring American territories. But with regard to 
land wanted for town purposes (to which speculation is almost certain to 
direct itself in the first instance), I cannot caution you too strongly against 
allowing it to be disposed of at too low a sum. An upset price of at least 
£i per acre is, in my opinion, absolutely required, in order that the local 
government may in some degree participate in the profit of the probable 
sales, and that mere land-jobbing may be in some degree checked. When- 
ever a free legislature is assembled, it will be one of its duties to make 
further provision on this head. 

" To open land for settlement gradually ; not to sell beyond the limits 
of what is either surveyed or ready for immediate survey, and to prevent, 
as far as in you lies, squatting on unsold land. 

" To keep a separate account of all revenue to be derived from the 
sale of land, applying it to the purposes, for the present, of survey and 
communication, which, indeed, should be the first charge on land revenue; 
and you will of course remember that this will include the expense of the 
survey party (viz., sappers and miners) now sent out. I shall be anxious 
to receive such accounts at the earliest period at which they can be fur- 
nished. 

" Foreigners, as such, are not entitled to grants of waste land of the 
Crown in British colonies. But it is the strong desire of her Majesty's Gov- 
ernment to attach to this territory all peaceful settlers, without regard to 
nation. Naturalization should, therefore, be granted to all who desire it, 
and are not disqualified by special causes, and with naturalization the right 
of acquiring Crown land should follow. 



160 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

" You will pardon me if I enjoin on you, as imperative, the most diligent 
care that in the sales of land there should not be the slightest cause to im- 
pute a desire to show favor to the servants of the Hudson's Bay Company. 
Parliament will watch with jealousy every proceeding connected with such 
sales; and I shall rely upon you to take every precaution which not only 
impartial probity but deliberate prudence can suggest, that there shall be 
no handle given for a charge, I will not say of favor, but of indifference or 
apathy to the various kinds of land-jobbing, either to benefit favored indi- 
viduals or to cheat the land revenue, which are of so frequent occurrence 
at the outset of colonization, and which it is the duty of her Majesty's Gov- 
ernment, so far as lies in them, to repress." 



" I need scarcely observe to you that the object for which this officer 
and his party have been despatched to British Columbia is for the exclusive 
service of that colony. You will, therefore, afford him every assistance in 
your power for enabling him to commence immediately such operations in 
it as shall appear to him to be necessary, in anticipation of his commanding 
officer, Colonel Moody, R. E., who will follow him with as much rapidity 
as practicable. And I trust that, if Captain Parsons should require the 
temporary occupation for his party of the trading-posts up the country, 
which belong to the Hudson's Bay Company, you will take measures for 
affording him such accommodation." 



" With these few observations, I leave with confidence in your hands 
the powers entrusted to you by her Majesty's Government. These powers 
are indeed of very serious and unusual extent, but her Majesty's Government 
fully rely on your moderation and discretion in the use of them. You are 
aware that they have only been granted in so unusual a form on account 
of the very unusual circumstances which have called into being the colony 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 161 

committed to yonr charge, and which may for some time continue to char- 
acterize it. To use them, except for the most necessary purposes, would 
be, in truth, to abuse them greatly. They are required for the maintenance 
of British law and British habits of order, and for regulating the special 
questions to which the condition and employment of the population may give 
birth. But the office of legislation, in the higher and more general sense, 
should be left for the legislature which may l3e hereafter constituted, and 
which her Majesty's Government hope will be constituted at the first time 
consistent with the general interests of the colony. And you will above all 
remember that the ordinary rights and privileges of British subjects and 
of those foreigners who dwell under British protection, must l&gt;e sedulously 
maintained, and that no innovation contrary to the principles of our law 
can be justified, except for purposes of absolute and temporary necessity. 

" I will only add that, although it has been judged prudent not to make 
the revocation of the Hudson's Bay Company's license take efifect until pro- 
claimed by yourself, it is the particular instructions of her Majesty's Gov- 
ernment that you proclaim it with the least practicable delay, so that no 
questions like those which have already arisen as to the extent and nature 
of the Company's rights can possibly occur." 



" With respect to offices generally, which the public exigencies may 
compel you tO' create, and for which selections should be made in England, 
I hive to observe that I consider it of great importance to the general social 
welfare and dignity of the colony that gentlemen should be encouraged to 
come from this kingdom, not as mere adventurers seeking employment, but 
in the hope of obtaining professional occupations for which they are calcu- 
lated; such, for instance, as stipendiary magistrates or gold commissioners. 

" You will, therefore, report to me at your early convenience, whether 
there is any field for such situations, and describe as accurately as you can 



Ifi2 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the peculiar qualifications which are requisite, in order that I may assist 
you by making the best selections in my power. It is quite natural that the 
servants of the Hudson's Bay Company should, from their knowledge of 
business, their abilities and services, have a very fair claim to consideration 
and share in the disposal of the local patronage. But caution should be 
observed against yielding to any appearance of undue favor or exclusiveness 
to the servants of that company. You will carefully remember that the 
public interests are the first consideration, and that it should be known 
that employment in the public service is as open and fair in British Co- 
lumbia as in every other of the Queen's colonial possessions. For these 
reasons it is still more desirable that careful appointments should be made 
in England. You will not fail to write to me fully by each mail, as her 
Majesty'^ Government wish to know everything that passes of importance 
in British Columbia." 



" Such arrangements may on the whole be most congenial to the disposi- 
tion of the American miners whom you may have to consider; but I cannot 
forget that it was the system of enforcing, from time to time, the license fee 
which created in Victoria so much dissatisfaction, and ultimately led to 
the Ballarat riot, and to the adoption of new rules. The Victorian system 
was in the main the same as that which you have apparently adopted. It 
exacted a license fee of £i from each miner per month, and, as Sir Charles 
Hotham says in a despatch, 21st November, 1855, to Sir William Moles- 
worth, ' the great and primary cause of complaint which I found was un- 
doubtedly the license fee.' 

" It was then decided that the monthly license fee should be abolished, 
and be replaced, independently of royalties, first, by a miner's annual cer- 
tificate of £1 ; secondly, by the payment of £10 per annum on every acre of 
alluvial soil; and thirdly, by an indirect tax in the shape of 2s. 6d. export 
duty on the ounce of gold. Experience seems, as far as we yet know, to 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 163 

have justified this change in Victoria. Discontent, with its attendant dangers, 
has been removed; and by the present system, which appears to be acqui- 
esced in by all parties, a larger revenue is obtained than ever was the case 
under the earlier arrangement. I obsen^e, indeed, by the last Victorian re- 
turns for 1856, that the duties on the export of gold amounted to more 
than £376,000." 

" It is my object to provide for, or to suggest to you how to meet 
all unforeseen exigencies to the colony as they may arise; but my views 
are based on the assumption that the common interest in life and property 
will induce the immigrants to combine amongst themselves for ordinary 
purposes, and that when danger needing military force arises, they will 
readily gather around and swell the force, which will thus expand as cir- 
cumstances require. From England we send skill and discipline; the raw 
material (that is, the mere men), a colony intended for free institutions, and 
on the border of so powerful a neighbor as the United States of America, 
should learn betimes of itself to supply. 

" Referring to the laudable co-operation in the construction of the road 
which has been evoked by your energy from= the good sense and public spirit 
of the miners, I rejoice to see how fully that instance of the zeal and intel- 
ligence to be expected from the voluntary efforts of immigrants, uniting in 
the furtherance of interests common to them all, bears out the principle of 
policy on which T designed to construct a colony intended for self-govern- 
ment, and trained to its exercise by self-reliance. The same characteristics 
which have made these settlers combine so readily in the construction of 
a road, will, I trust, under the same able and cheering influence which you 
prove that you know so well how to exercise, cause them equally to unite 
in the formation of a police, in the establishment of law, in the collection 
of revenue, in short, in all which may make individual life secure and the 
community prosperous. I trust you will assure the hardy and spirited men 



164 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

who have assisted in this prdiminary undertaking, how much their conduct 
is appreciated by her Majesty's Govemment. 

" I feel thankful for the valuable services so seasonably and efficiently 
rendered by the " Satellite " and " Plumper." I cannot conclude without a cor- 
dial expression of my sympathy in the difficulties you have encountered, and 
of my sense of the ability, the readiness of resource, the wise and manly temper 
of conciliation which you have so signally displayed ; and I doubt not that 
you will continue to show the same vigor and the same discretion in its 
exercise; and you may rely with confidence on whatever support and aid 
her Majesty's Government can afford you." 

Officialdom. 

A careful perusal of the foregoing will show how carefully and intel- 
ligently the wants of the colony had been thought out, and what a liberal 
and advanced conception of pioneer colonial conditions T&gt;ord Lvtton pos- 
sessed. According to the intimations made in Lord Lytton's despatches, 
as in the foregoing, two detachments of the Royal Engineers were despatched 
to British Columbia, one on the 2nd of September in the steamer "La Plata," 
under command of Captain Parsons, who was accompanied by twenty non- 
commissioned officers and men ; and the other by the clipper ship " Thames 
City,'" 557 tons, on September 17th, which was made up of two officers, one 
staff assistant surgeon, eighteen non-commissioned officers and men, thirty-one 
women and thirty-four children, the whole under the command of Captain 
R. H. Luard, R. E. Captain Parsons was the bearer of important communi- 
cations to Governor Douglas. One was his commission as Governor of 
British Columbia, another empowering him to make due provision for the 
administration of justice and the establishment of laws for the maintenance 
of law and order; and still another notifying him of the revocation of the 
charter of May 30th, 1838, so far as the Mainland was concerned. By the 
same mail came the advice of the appointment of Colonel Moody to the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 165 

command of the Royal Engineers, and to the office of chief commissioner of 
lands and works. Under his instructions he was second in command to 
Governor Douglas, from whom he was in certain matters to take orders, 
but with special duties that were not to be interfered with unless " under 
circumstances of the greatest gravity." Simultaneously also came the ad- 
vice of the appointment of Matthew Baillie Begbie as Giief Justice of the 
new Colony, who was to receive a salary of £800 and would sail by packet 
on October 2nd. With these despatches came copies of proclamations de- 
claring British law to be in force in British Columbia, and indemnifying 
the governor and other officers for acts done before the establishment of 
legitimate authority. With the appointment of W. Wymond Hamley as 
collector of customs, the organization of British Columbia was practically 
complete, and it only required the arrival of the incoming officials to set 
the machinery of government in full operation. This was in 1858, but it 
was not until 1864 that the mainland colony was granted a representative 
assembly, as will be seen later. In the meantime officialdom was king, and 
the word of James Douglas was law. 

In due time by various routes Colonel Moody, Chief Justice Begbie, 
Mr. Hamley, Captain Parsons and the detachments of Royal Engineers and 
the corps of Sappers and Miners arrived, and the real work of starting a 
colony began. 

Preliminary to Organized Government. 

To go back a step, however, the rush of miners to the Eraser River 
made it necessary, as I have said, to take steps towards preserving law and 
order and reducing the operations of the miners to some system having 
respect for the rights of the community as well as of the individual. It was 
a difficult task to be confronted. Those who have read the story of the 
mining excitement of '49 in California, and the pages of history for the 
years immediately following will understand the character of population 
from which the exodus to British Columbia was drawn. The annals of 



166 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

San Francisco in the early days are replete with incidents of gambling, rob- 
bery and hold-ups, murder, vice of all kinds, and general social misrule. 
The disregard for life was one of the pre\'ailing tendencies of the pioneer 
mining camp. In its wake followed all the toughs and blacklegs and des- 
peradoes, which a free and unfettered life in the far west developed to prey 
on unorganized or imperfectly organized society. The miner himself was 
usually an honest man, with a high native regard for the rights of his 
neighbors. He had many excellent qualities of head and heart, and was 
a good example of what we usually understand by the " diamond in the 
rough." But one of his cardinal principles was not to interfere with other 
people's business, and to ask no questions. If games went on he accepted 
it as one of the natural concomitants of the life. If men drank, and fought, 
and cheated at cards and were shot they regarded the incidents as the 
" lookout " of those who engaged in them. He did not constitute himself 
a guardian over either the souls or the bodies of any person. If there was 
excitement he might take a hand in it. He knew and was prepared for 
the risks. If he were wise he kept out of the way of the toughs. If he 
got entangled in the meshes of the many webs that were woven in this rough 
and ready society, and got the worst of it, it was part of the game. So 
the outcasts of society found in the mining camp and a city like San Fran- 
cisco, a Mecca of adventurers, a congenial soil in which to take root and 
flourish. It was from the many elements of which the Forty-Niners of 
which California were composed that Fraser River gold seekers were drawn. 
Douglas understood the men he had to deal with, and was prepared to deal 
with them. He proposed to instill in their hearts a wholesome respect of 
British law. Incidentally he did not forget that he was doing business for 
the Hudson's Bay Company. His first move was to establish the authority 
of the latter. He had a fleet of British warhsips at hand, two boats, the 
" Otter " and the " Beaver," the property of the Company, to assist him in 
maintaining order and peace and enforcing his commands. Fortunately for the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 167 

country Douglas was on hand to exercise an authority which, though ille- 
gally exercised on his part, was necessary, and, therefore, by virtue of the 
exigencies of the situation became law, subsequently confirmed. A procla- 
mation was issued on the 8th of May to the effect that *' any vessels found 
in British northwest waters not having a license from the Hudson's Bay 
Company and a sufferance from the customs officer at Victoria should be 
forfeited." The proclamation was in the main respected, and it had the 
effect of bringing every person to Victoria as a starting point. The Gov- 
ernor proceeded himself to the mainland, and found at Langley. then a 
post of the Hudson's Bay Company and a principal- point of attraction for the 
incomers, a number of speculators taking possession of the land and staking 
out lots for sale, he found unlicensed canoes, and contraband trading going 
on. All these matters were speedily set right to his own liking. Fort Hope 
and Fort Yale farther up the river soon also became places of importance. 
These were visited by the Governor. The miners prior to his arrival had 
already organized a form of government for their requirements and had 
already posted regulations. These were replaced by regulations drawn up 
and proclaimed in the name of the Governor of Vancouver Island. Persons 
carrying on business were required to pay a fee of $7.50 monthly for the 
use of land, and the owners of claims to pay $5 a month license. Strict 
observance of the Sabbath was enjoined and a heavy fine was imposed on 
those found guilty of selling liquor to the Indians. Special constables were 
appointed, courts of justice were established, and permission was granted 
to aliens to hold land without interference for three years, after which it 
became necessary to take the oath of allegiance. There was a good deal 
of complaint about the arbitrary rule of the Hudson's Bay Company, and 
the exaction of the temporary mining and other regulations. There were 
also troubles among the miners, incipient revolution; but the turbulent ones 
were soon quelled, and the early mining records of the Fraser as well as 
of the Cariboo later on are remarkably free from notes of disorder. There 



168 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

was trouble with the Indians, who resented the invasion of the " Boston " 
men. as the Americans were called by them; and an Indian war ag-ainst the 
whites was only averted by the influence of the Hudson's Bay Company. 
As a matter of fact, bloodshed did occur, two Frenchmen having been killed. 
The miners organized themselves for defense and enrolled under H. M. 
Snyder. They marched as far as the Thompson River, made treaties with 
some 2,000 Indians between Spuzzum and the Forks. of the Thompson River 
and returned to Yale. The casualties altogether were not very large, being 
several whites and about thirty Indians. This was the end of the campaign. 
Road-building was also undertaken. Mr. McKay, a member of the Legis- 
lative Assembly of Vancouver Island, who was with Douglas on a trip up 
the Fraser. was instructed to return to the coast by way of Big Lillooet Lake 
to ascertain the feasibility of a shorter route. He proceeded to the head of 
Howe Sound and reported that the route he had followed was the best and 
shortest whereby to reach the mines, but on account of the question of ex- 
pense in opening up the road the route was never adopted. At Langley 
preparations were made for the reception of the Royal Engineers and party 
from England and a sale of town lots to take place at Victoria on the 20th 
of October was advertised. It may be here stated that it had been the inten- 
tion of making Fort I^ngley the capital of the Mainland, a decision that 
was subsequently changed in favor of New Westminster. 

Choosing the Capital. 

Following the preliminaries outlined before going, which were ante- 
cedent to any recognized form of government, came the resignation of 
Douglas as chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, his formal appoint- 
ment as Governor of the Colony of British Columbia, the arrival of Chiet 
Justice Begbie, of Lt. Col. Moody, of Captains Grant and Parsons, the Royal 
Engineers, the sappers and miners and all the rest of the Government para- 
phernalia. What followed was in accordance with the instructions contained 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 169 

in the despatches from Lord Lytton, extracts from which have already been 
given in the preceding. The sale of Langley town lots as advertised came 
off. The bidding was brisk, and the demand active. In two days some 400 
lots were sold ranging from $100 to $400 per lot and aggregating $68,000. It, 
as stated, was to have been the capital of British Columbia, and work had 
already begun on the erection of the barracks, and tenders were called for 
the erection of church, parsonage, courthouse and jail there. The arrival 
of Col. Moody, the new Commissioner of Lands and Works and commander 
of the forces, changed all that. He had hardly arrived, however, when he 
was despatched to Yale along with some of his Royal Engineers and a party 
of marines and blue jackets to quell a reported uprising among the miners. 
The matter did not prove to be very serious, having arisen out of a dispute 
among special constables, over the body of a prisoner. Prominent among 
these was the notorious Edward McGowen, who was finally obliged to leave 
the " diggings." The incident was made more of in history than its im- 
portance deserved. Probably on account of the display of force made by 
the Government officials and the promptitude with which they responded to 
the demand for assistance, the trouble was not greater than it was. It had 
a most splendid moral effect on the miners, who were impressed with the 
thoroughness and efficiency with which the administration of justice was 
carried out. There never was thereafter any bar disturbance, because it 
was nothing more than that, in which Ned McGowen with over-zeal, so Cap- 
tain Mayne says, committed an assault, is memorable for having laid sure 
the foundations of peace in the new colony. On his return from Yale in 
H. M. S. " Plumper," Col. Moody examined the site of the present city of New 
Westminster for the purposes of a capital and selected it in preference to 
Derby, as it was proposed to call Langley. It is said that Col. Moody, in 
going up past it to Yale on his punitive expedition, pointed to the sloping 
hillside and remarked upon its advantages from a strategical point of view. 
Its commanding position, its accessibility from the rear to the sea, and the 



170 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

dqjth of water on its frontage were all advantages in its favor over Derby. 
After conference with Governor Douglas at Victoria the recommendation 
of Col. Moody was adopted and the plans were altered accordingly. A town 
site was surveyed and parties who had purchased town lots in Derby were 
notified that they might surrender their lots there and receive others in 
Queenborough, or Queensborough, as you will, in their place. The late 
Sir Henry Crease, in a contribution made to the Year Book of British 
Columbia at the request of the author, described some incidents of interest 
in connection with the selection of the capital of New Westminster, for 
thus it came to be called : " Col. Moody, R. E., who had come out with a 
corps of four hundred engineers to assist in protecting and advancing the 
country, and had a dormant commission as its Governor in case of the 
prolonged absence, illness, or incapacity of the Governor, at once opposed 
the selection of Langley as being on the wrong bank of the river, and inde- 
fensible on military grounds, and with his officers sought a suitable site on 
the right bank proper, and against the advice of his officers, at first fixed 
on Mary Hill, a fine and elevated site near the mouth of Pitt River, in 
preference to a still finer site a couple of miles lower down on the right 
bank, and ordered his senior captain — Captain Jack Grant, as he was famil- 
iarly termed, now General Grant, R. E. — to take the axe and make the first 
cut at one of the trees nearest the river. He was in the act of swinging 
his axe to deliver the blow, when he was so much impressed with the mis- 
take they were making that he said : ' Colonel, with much submission I will 
ask not to do it. Will you yourself be pleased to take the responsibility of 
making the first cut?' — respectfully giving his reasons. These were of sa 
cogent a nature, one being that the lower site being at the head of tide- 
water, big ships could come up the Eraser to it, and that it was easily de- 
fensible by a tete du pont on the opposite side of the river, and similar 
reasons, that the Colonel was convinced, rowed down the river and ordered 
the first cut to be delivered on one of the huge cedars with which the hill 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 171 

was covered, and named the new town ' Queenborough.' But so great 
already was the jealousy in Victoria against the projected new city that 
Queenborough was considered by the Colonial Secretary, Mr. W. A. G. 
Young, as too nearly a paraphrase of Victoria, the only permissible Queen 
city, that after a great inkshed and a long acrid correspondence the name 
was proclaimed to be not the Queenborough (Victoria), but Queensbor- 
ough, which was quite another thing. The site was put up to auction and 
sold at great prices on the understanding that all the money, a large sum, 
from the sale should be applied in opening the streets and clearing away 
from the lots some of as large and dense timber as the world could possibly 
produce^ — an undertaking which it need scarcely be said the government 
for lack of money to push its roads and public works could not, or would 
not provide, and the purchasers were obliged to tax themselves a second 
time and engage in ' bees,' as in old Canada, to get even a small quantity 
of the site cleared and to submit to the feeling of having been deceived, 
and to see Victoria's streets and roads flourish while Queensborough had to 
be content with trails. The sequel may as well be told. The matter was 
taken up by the Home Government, Her Majesty was engaged to finally 
fix on the name and by Royal Proclamation, Queensborough (a convenient 
name) was converted into a Royal city, and the capital of British Columbia 
under the name of New Westminster (an inconvenient one), and on the 
faith of that many invested their all in it." 

The camp of the Royal Engineers was located about one mile west 
of New Westminster, where the Provincial Penitentiary now stands. Here 
the sappers and miners went to work to prepare permanent quarters and 
on account of that was named Sapperton, which as a suburb of the city it is 
still known as. Here an official residence for Col. Moody and family and 
suite was erected, and here the first church in the colony of British Colum- 
bia was raised for the purposes of public worship. Col. Moody moved from 
Victoria to his new residence on the i8th of May, 1859. Work on the 



173 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

clearing of the town site and the making of the streets was carried on. 
Oueensborough was on the 2nd of June declared to be the sole port of entry 
for vessels entering the Fraser River, and for all goods imported by sea 
into the ports of British Columbia adjacent to the Fraser River, and a tariff 
of customs duties was established. The first sale of Queensborough lots took 
place in June and was most successful. This was followed on July 20th 
by a proclamation setting forth that Her Majesty had decided to change 
the name of the capital to New Westminster. 

Road Building Extraordinary. 

Governor Douglas was essentially a road-builder and had he lived to- 
day, instead of over fifty years ago, when his energies were at their prime, 
he would in all probability have been a railway magnate or as the leader 
of a government would have had a strong railway and road policy. Even 
at this early date he launched out in a policy of building roads, which in 
their every detail remain to-day a monument to the zeal, energy and care 
which he displayed in their undertaking. The Royal Engineers were a mili- 
tary organization, but their purpose in British Columbia was not so much 
that of defense as the opening up of the country by the laying out of roads, 
the work of which they entered upon with zest; that they did not persevere 
in the good work which they began was due to the fact that the residents of 
British Columbia did not think their services were necessary, and there was 
the usual jealousy as to their supervision of public works. The alleged 
reason for their disbandment, w'hich took place in 1863, was that their special 
services were unnecessary. They, however, performed splendid works in 
laying the foundation and were a splendid lot of men. Those who wished 
to return were given a free passage to England. Those who wished to re- 
main were each allowed a free grant of 150 acres of land. The greater 
number, enamored with the freedom and abandon of a new country, and 
the prospects of participating in coming development, chose to remain, mak- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 1T3 

ing their selections out of unoccupied land. Col. Moody and staff, accom- 
panied by some twenty-five or thirty of the force, returned to England. 
Road building was a conspicuous feature of the years between 1859 and 
1864, the year of Governor Douglas's retirement. Speaking of that we may 
again quote the remarks of the late Sir Henry Crease. He remarks that, 
" Next to the great financial principle for government which he professed, 
roads in Vancouver Island and British Columbia were the one great object 
which Governor Douglas, during his long reign, always kept in view. He 
was a king of roads. As a Hudson's Bay Company officer he had traveled 
from end to end of this great country from the earlier days of the Hudson's 
Bay Company down to the time he had charge of its affairs, and knew 
the difticulty and delay caused in getting in supplies to the out-stations, and 
was thoroughly convinced that no mining could be carried on for any 
length of time profitably without giving the greatest possible facilities for 
getting supplies to their works, and in Vancouver Island in enabling farm- 
ers to take their produce without difficulty to market. So everywhere around 
Victoria for miles splendid roads, much better than they are now (1897), 
well macadamized, abounded. Many and good roads were made into the 
interior and along the coast, where the configuration of grounds made them 
practicable. Thence, they were extended into the districts outside of Vic- 
toria — e. g., Cowichan, Chemainus, Saanich and Lake, were duplicated, nay, 
even at times, as for instance at Comox, triplicated — and a still greater and 
bolder enterprise was contemplated by Sir James Douglas, and indeed com- 
menced by him on the Mainland, no less than a prospective toll wagon road 
from Hope, the then head of navigation of the Fraser River, through Hope, 
Similkameen and Okanagan, down and across the Columbia to Kootenay, 
and more ambitious still, through the Rocky Mountain Passes and across the 
Indian territory via Edmonton House to meet a similar road from Canada 
westward towards British Columbia, which he confidently expected eastern 
Canada would build to meet him at Edmonton, and form together a great 



174 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

British Canadian colonization road, England being too far off to expect any 
general colonization from thence. General immigration from Canada east 
was always his idea, fostered, no doubt, by his familiarity with the Hudson's 
Bay Company coasts in that direction and away north. Convinced always 
that population ultimately would come from Canada there is reason to be- 
lieve that so satisfied was he of the benefit it would be both to British Co- 
lumbia and Canada, that he was inclined to press such a scheme as a toll 
colonization road if it could be favored by the Home Government, and he 
' hoped to obtain from them what then would have been an impossible com- 
mission. At first his aims were confined to opening the country by roads 
along the Fraser up to the bars and placers where already gold was found 
in paying quantities and more expected further up. Miners and prospectors 
fitting out at Victoria took at first the " Otter " and " Beaver," the only two 
Hudson's Bay Company steamers which had come out to this country round 
Cape Horn to Queensborough, and by sternwheel steamer to Douglas. Then 
from Douglas they proceeded along the Pemberton Portage and the Lakes, 
which were crossed by steamer to Lillooet, where they joined the Fraser 
and its gold bearing bars again. From Lillooet a wagon road was pro- 
jected to climb up Pavilion Mountain by the well-known Rattlesnake grade 
and go on to Clinton and from thence on through the green timber and 
the fifty-mile alkali belt along Lac La Hache to the i5oMile House, thence 
to Soda Creek, Alexandria and Quesnel Mouth; thence direct east by Cot- 
tonwood and Van Winkle to Richfield and Williams Creek, some of the 
richest gold-fields of the rich Cariboo country. The Similkameen road from 
Hope was commenced as a trail, with the progress and prospects of which 
Governor Douglas was so pleased that he directed it to be converted into 
a wagon road. This he intended as a toll road to Kootenay and across the 
Rockies, but required a petition from the people of Hope, who would have 
been enriched by the business of the road, requesting him to impose a small 
toll on goods and passengers to authorize him to raise and expend the neces- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 175 

sary money. At the instance, however, of a petty local opposition the peti- 
tion was not signed. The Similkameen route as a through road fell through 
— although, as will be shown, a good and valuable trail was afterwards made 
in that direction. 

" Failing at Hope, a public meeting was held at Yale, the merchants 
of which were delighted at the chance, and warmly espoused a wagon road 
along the rocky canons and forbidding defiles and banks of the Fraser, 
passing Lytton and up the Thompson by way of Ashcroft and the Bona- 
parte to join the other part of the wagon road at Qinton, thus making the 
connection with Caribco complete — and giving the whole of the Lillooet- 
Yale road to Cariboo the general name of the Cariboo Road — a monument 
to the determined will, outlay and skill of the chief who ordered and the 
men who executed this (even at this day) wonderful effort of engineering 
skill, and which opened up such a long and wide tract of auriferous as well 
as agricultural country." 

Tlie men who constructed this great work were the Royal Engineers, 
who were paid by the Colony, and local men. A list is here given of the 
roads constructed under Sir James Douglas's regime, and the men who 
made them :

Now to return to the wagon road from Hope to and across the Rockies. 

Having been obliged to abandon his original plan, which was a wagon 
road, commenced by ex-Lieutenant-Governor Hon. E. Dewdney, in addi- 
tion to the numerous works of surveying and engineering he had already 
completed in the Colony — he had done twelve miles of it when it was stopped, 
for lack of the supjxDrt I have described from the people of Hope, but the road 
was carried on twenty-five miles to Skagit Flat. From thence the Royal 
Engineers carried on a trail to Princeton, which was -afterwards much im- 
proved by Alison's cut-off. This trail was improved from Skagit to the 
Summit. It was then carried through the open, down the Similkameen 
country. In 1865, Mr. Dewdney commenced a trail down the Similkameen, 
by Keremeos to Osoyoos ; thence he followed the boundary along down Kettle 
River Valley to the mouth of Christine Creek; thence across the mountains 
to Fort Shepherd east of the Columbia, crossing the Kootenay River at the 
mouth of Kootenay Lake. This was in 1865, when Sir Joseph W. Trutch 
was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works. From Kootenay Lake, Mr. 
Dewdney carried the trail by the Mooyie to Wild Swan Creek, now called 
Fort Steele. This was done from Osoyoos in 1865, but it has been much 
improved since. It has always been called Dewdney Trail, and it has been 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 177 

by means of Dewdney that access has been given to the rich Kootenay coun- 
try, and great facilities afiforded for the discovery and exploration of valu- 
able deposits of gold in that district. In fact, the Dewdney trail was the 
key to the Kootenays. 



178 BRITISH COLUMBIA 



CHAPTER IX. 
UNION OF THE COLONIES. 

Scarcely had the colony of British Columbia been fully organized, as 
described in the last chapter, when an agitation was set on foot for represent- 
ative government and union with the colony of Vancouver Island. With the 
limited population and the contiguity of the two colonies it was the most 
natural thing in the world that union should be suggested. There was dual 
governorship, a dual set of officials, a dual system of fiscal arrangements, and 
a dual administration of justice. It was obvious that by consolidation a 
large item of expense might be saved. There were difficulties in the way 
of even so simple a solution — personal interests and sectional considerations. 

Early in 1861 a memorial was presented to Governor Douglas from 
residents of several parts of the Mainland asking for a representative As- 
sembly for the colony of British Columbia. This was inevitable. The colony 
was ruled directly by representatives of the Crown, nominally by the sov- 
ereign, through a responsible minister, the Secretary for the Colonies, who 
conveyed his instructions to the British Columbia officials. These were car- 
ried into effect under the supervision of the Governor. Vancouver Island, 
a much smaller colony and less important from many points of view, had a 
legislative assembly, and it cannot be wondered at that the residents of Brit- 
ish Columbia should seek for similar consideration. Sir James Douglas did 
not favor, this. There were several reasons which suggested opposition on 
his part. His experience so far as the more favored colony of Vancouver 
Island was concerned did not argue for its usefulness in his mind. The As- 
sembly there was largely the creature of his will, and of his successors, Gov- 
ernors Kennedy and Seymour, neither regarded it as of particular import- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 179 

ance. The former in a dispatch said : " There is no medium or connecting 
hnk between the G( ,^elncr ?nd the Assembly, and the time of the Legislative 
Council (which comprises the principal executive officers ) is mainly occupied 
in the correction of mistakes, or undoing the crude legislation of the lower 
House, who have not, and cannot be expected to have, the practical experi- 
ence or available time necessary for the successful conduct of public affairs. 
On financial subjects they are always greatly at fault." Governor Seymour 
in a dispatch on the same subject remarked : " The loss of the House of As- 
sembly would not, I think, be much regretted." That Governor Douglas, 
whose nature was to rule with a lone hand, should not have a high opinion 
of that Assembly is not to be wondered at. Tliere was, again, the personal 
reason that he did not desire to share with any legislative or representative 
body the responsibilities of government. A man who had been chief factor 
in the Hudson's Bay Company, an aggregation of autocrats, with a long ex- 
perience of supreme authority, could not adapt himself to the limitations to 
be imposed by what he could not but regard as inferior officials. He had 
been reared in the kind of school that did not brook contradiction. But 
there was still another reason, and we must do justice to Sir James in sup- 
posing that it had due weight with him. In fact, there were a number of 
reasons. He was a man of practical ideas. His experience in the govern- 
ment of men and in affairs had taught him useful lessons, and one of them 
was that a wise autocracy is better than rule by democracy. He cared little 
for theories of government. He believed in direct methods and undivided 
responsibility. Apart from that there were peculiar circumstances in British 
Columbia that rendered the system of government in vogue in England as the 
result of centuries of development inapplicable to a new country with un- 
stable and unsettled conditions. These reasons he set out ably and clearly 
in a dispatch to the Secretary of State, dated April 22nd, 1861. After en- 
umerating the steps which had been taken to lay before him the views of the 
delegation, which had waited upon him, he pointed out that what they had in 



180 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

mind was a general reduction of taxation, and that instead of a system of 
import and inland duties levied on goods, which were regarded as oppres- 
sive, they proposed to carry on the public works necessary for the develop- 
ment of the country by means of public loans, their object being to throw 
a portion of the burden upon posterity, something which he regarded, as in- 
deed, not without a measure of justice in it, and consequently with many 
zealous advocates. It may be remarked incidentally that the memorialists 
were certainly not antiquated in their ideas of public finance and really antici- 
pated a policy that became only too popular in later years, and was carried 
to such an extreme as to shift an inordinate share of burden on future gen- 
erations, and to seriously impair the credit of the province. In proceeding 
to review the various subjects brought to his attention, he remarked : 

Douglas's Views on a Legislature for British Columbia. 

" The first prayer of the inhabitants is for a resident governor in British 
Columbia, entirely unconnected with Vancouver Island. Your Grace, will 
perhaps, pardon me from hazarding an opinion on a subject which so nearly 
concerns my own official position. I may, however, at least remark that I 
have spared no exertion to promote the interests of both colonies, and am not 
conscious of having neglected any opportunity of adding to their prosperity. 
The memorial then proceeds to the subject of Representative Institutions, 
asking for a form of government similar to that existing in Australia and the 
Eastern British North American Provinces. This application should, per- 
haps, be considered to apply more to the future well-being of the colony than 
to the views and wishes of the existing population. Without pretending to 
question the talent or experience of the petitioners, or their capacity for legis- 
lation and self-government, I am decidedly of opinion that there is not, as 
yet, a sufficient basis of population or property in the colony to institute a 
sound system of self-government. The British element is small, and there 
is absolutely neither a manufacturing nor farmer class; there are no landed 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 181 

proprietors, except holders of building lots in towns; no producers, except 
miners, and the general population is essentially migratory — the only fixed 
population, apart from New Westminster, being the traders settled in the 
several inland towns, from which the miners obtain their supplies. It would, 
I conceive, be unwise to commit the work of legislation to persons so situated, 
having nothing at stake, and no real vested interest in the colony. Such a 
course, it is hardly unfair to say, could be scarcely expected to promote either 
the happiness of the people or the prosperity of the colony ; and it would un- 
questionably be setting up a power that might materially hinder and em- 
barrass the Government in the great work of developing the resources of this 
country ; a power not representing large bodies of landed proprietors, nor of 
responsible settlers having their homes, their property, their sympathies, their 
dearest interest irrevocably identified with the country; but from the fact 
before stated, of there being no fixed population, except in the towns. Judg- 
ing from the ordinary motives which influence men, it may be assumed that 
local interests would weigh more with a legislature so formed, than the ad- 
vancement of the great and permanent interests of the country. 

" I have reason to belive that the memorial does not express the senti- 
ments of the great body of the people of British Columbia, not that I would, 
for a moment, assume that Englishmen are, under any circumstances, un- 
mindful of their political birthright, but I believe that the majority of the 
working and reflective classes would, for many reasons, infinitely prefer the 
government of the Queen, as now established, to the rule of a party, and 
would think it prudent to postpone the establishment of representative in- 
stitutions until the permanent population of the country is greatly increased 
and capable of moral influence, by maintaining the peace of the country, and 
making representative institutions a blessing and a reality, and not a by- 
word or a curse. 

" The total population of British Columbia and from the colonies in 
North America, in the three towns supposed to be represented by the memo- 



182 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

rialists, is as follows: New Westminster, 164 male adults; Hope, 108 adults; 
Douglas, 33 adults, in all 305, which, supposing all perfect in their views 
respecting representative institutions, is a mere fraction of the population. 
Neither the people of Yale, Lytton or Cayoosh, Rock Creek, Alexandria, or 
Similkameen appear to have taken any interest in the proceeding or to have 
joined the movement. 

" From the satisfactory working of the New Westminster Council, es- 
tablished last summer, with large powers for municipal purposes, I enter- 
tained the idea of enlarging the sphere of their operations, and of constituting 
similar bodies at Hope, Yale, and Cayoosh, and all the other towns in British 
Columbia, with the view, should it meet with the approval of Her Majesty's 
Government, of ultimately developing the whole system into a House of As- 
sembly. Part of the system has already been commenced at Yale and Hope. 
The Government may, by that means, call into exercise the sagacity and 
knowledge of practical men, and acquire valuable information upon local 
matters, thus reaping one of the advantages of a legislative assembly without 
the risks — and, I still think the colony may, for some time to come, be suf- 
ficiently represented in that manner. 

" The existing causes of dissatisfaction as alleged in the memorial, may 
be classified under the following heads: (i) That the Governor, Colonial 
Secretary and Attorney General do not reside permanently in British Colum- 
bia. (2) That the taxes on goods are excessive as compared with the 
population, and in part levied on boatmen, who derive no benefit from them, 
and that there is no land tax. (3) That the progress of Victoria is stimu- 
lated at the expense of British Columbia, and that no encouragement is given 
to shipbuilding or to the foreign trade of the colony. (4) That money has 
been injudiciously squandered on public works and contracts given without 
any public notice, which subsequently have been sub-let to the contractors 
at a much lower rate. (5) That faulty administration has been made of 
public lands, and that lands have been declared public reserves, which have 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 183 

been afterwards claimed by parties connected with the Colonial Government. 
(6) The want of a registry office, for the record of transfers and mortgages. 
" The first complaint, that the Governor, etc., do not reside permanently 
in British Columbia, scarcely requires comment from me. Your Grace is 
aware that I have a divided duty to perform, and that if under the present 
circumstances the Colonial Secretary and Attorney General resided perma- 
nently in British Columbia, these offices would be little better than a sinecure 
— the public service would be retarded and a real and just complaint would 
exist. Although the treasury is now established at New Westminster, and 
the Treasurer resides permanently there, I have nO' hesitation in saying that 
it would be far more for the benefit of the public service if that department 
were still in Victoria. 

" The complaint of over-taxation is not peculiar to British Columbia, 
but whether it is well founded or not may be inferred from the example of 
other countries. Judging from that estimate, the people of British Columbia 
have certainly no reason for complaint of their public burdens, for the United 
States tariff which is vigorously enforced in the neighboring parts of Wash- 
ington Territory, averages 25 per cent on all foreign goods — spirits and other 
articles of luxury excepted, on which a much higher rate of duty is charged. 
The citizen of Washington Territory has also to pay the assessed road and 
school taxes, levied by the Territorial Legislature. In contrast with these 
taxes, the import duty levied in British Columbia is only ten per cent, with 
a similar exception of spirits and a few articles of luxury, which pay a higher 
duty; while all other taxes levied in the colony are also proportionately low, 
compared with those of Washington Territory. I might also further state 
that two-thirds of the taxes raised in British Columbia have been expended 
in making roads, and other useful works, and have produced a reduction of 
not less than a hundred per cent on the cost of transport, and nearly as great 
a saving in the cost of all the necessaries of life, so that while the communi- 



184 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

cations are \^mg rapidly improved, the people are, at the same time, really 
reaping substantial benefits more than compensating the outlay. 

" With respect to the complaint about the boatmen, they had no claim 
whatever to be exempted from the law imposing a duty indiscriminately on 
all goods passing upward from Yale, neither did the duty bear at all upon 
them, as they were merely carriers, and not owners of the goods. The real 
question at issue was, whether the inland duty should be charged on goods 
carried from Yale by water as well as by land, and was nothing more than 
a scheme concocted by the owners of the goods to benefit themselves at the 
expense of the public revenue, 

" And here I would beg to correct an error in the memorial with re- 
spect to the population of British Columbia, which is therein given at 7,000, 
exclusive of Indians, making an annual average rate of taxation of £7 los 
per head. The actual population. Chinamen included, is about 10,000, besides 
an Indian population exceeding 20,000, making a total of 30,000, which re- 
duces the taxation to £2- per head instead of the rate given in the memorial. 
It must be remembered that all the white population are adults, and tax-pay- 
ing — there being no proportionate number of women or children, and it is 
a great mistake to suppose that the native Indians pay no taxes. They have, 
especially in the gold districts, for the most part, abandoned their former 
pursuits and no longer provide their own stores of food. All the money 
they make by their labor, either by hire or by gold digging, is expended in 
the country, so that the Indians have now become very extensive consumers 
of foreign articles. Every attention has been given to render Fraser River 
safe and accessible ; the channels have been carefully surveyed and marked 
with conspicuous buoys; and foreign vessels may go direct to New West- 
minster, without calling at Victoria, and the port dues are the same whether 
the vessels clear originally from Victoria or come directly from foreign 
ports. It is impossible to imagine a more perfect equality of legislative pro- 
tection than is given to these ports. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 185 

" I have had applications, under various pretexts, from almost every 
trading place in the colony for remissions of duty, and I have steadily resisted 
all such applications on the ground that class legislation is vicious and leads 
to injustice and discontent. It is, moreover, very doubtful if the proposed 
remission of duty on shipbuilding materials would advance that interest, as 
long as the timber business of New Westminster is a monopoly in the hands 
of a few persons who keep timber at an unreasonably high price. 

" With respect to the fourth and fifth complaints I am not cognizant of 
any circumstances affording grounds for them. I addressed a letter to the 
Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, whose department they more im- 
mediately^ affected, and I forward herewith a copy of that officer's report, 
from which it will be seen that no just cause exists for the allegations made. 

" The want of a registry office, which also forms a subject of complaint, 
arises solely from our not having succeeded in maturing the details of a 
measure, which is, I feel, replete with difficulties of no ordinary kind, but 
that measure, providing for the registration of real estate, will be passed as 
soon as practicable. 

" Before concluding this dispatch, I shall submit a few observations on 
the financial system of Vancouver Island in contrast with that of British 
Columbia, explanatory of their distinctive features and their applicability to 
the colonies respectively. 

" The public revenue of Vancouver Island is almost derived from taxes 
levied directly on persons and professions, on trades and real estate, on the 
other hand, it is by means of duties and imposts, and on goods carried in- 
land, that the public revenue of British Columbia is chiefly raised. No other 
plan has been suggested by which a public revenue could be raised, that is so 
perfectly adapted to the circumstances of both colonies, or that could be sub- 
stituted or applied interchangeably with the advantage to the sister colony. 
The reasons may thus be stated: The low price and bulky productions of 
Vancouver Island will not bear the cost of exportation to any British pos- 



186 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

session, and are virtually excluded from the markets of the Mother Country 
by the distance and expense of the voyage. A precisely similar result is 
produced through the almost prohibitory duties levied in the neighboring 
ports of Oregon and California; the former, moreover, abounding in all the 
products common to Vancouver Island, except coal; and neither being in- 
ferior in point of soil, climate or any physical advantage. Thus practically 
debarred from commercial intercourse and denied a market for its produce, 
it became painfully evident that the colony could not prosper, nor ever be a 
desirable residence for white settlers, until a remunerative outlet was found 
for the produce of their labor. It was that state of things that originated 
the idea of creating a home market, and the advantageous position of Vic- 
toria suggested free trade as the means, which was from henceforth adopted 
as a policy — with the object of making the port a center of trade and popu- 
lation, and ultimately the commercial entrepot of the North Pacific. That 
policy was initiated several years previous to the discovery of gold in British 
Columbia, and has since been inflexibly maintained. Victoria has now 
grown into commercial importance, and its value and influence can hardly 
be overestimated. Financially, it furnishes four-fifths of the public revenue, 
it absorbs the whole surplus produce of the colony, and it is a center from 
whence settlements are gradually branching out into the interior of the 
island. Thus Victoria has become the center of population, the seat of trade, 
a prospective source of revenue, and a general market for the country. The 
settlements are all compactly situated within a radius of twenty miles, ex- 
cept those which are accessible by sea ; there is, therefore, no pressing call for 
large expenditure in the improvement of internal communications. Roads 
are opened where required, with due regard and in proportion to the means 
of the colony, its vital interests not being greatly affected by any avoidable 
delay. 

" The circumstances of British Columbia are materially different from 
those just described. That colony has large internal resources, which only 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 187 

require development to render it powerful and wealthy. Its extensive gold 
fields furnish a highly remunerative export, and are rapidly attracting trade 
and population. Mining has become a valuable branch of industry, and 
essentially the vital interest of the colony; it hereto has been my unceasing 
policy to encourage and develop that interest. The laws are framed in the 
most liberal spirit, studiously relieving miners from direct taxation, and 
vesting in the m'ining boards a general power to amend and adapt their pro- 
visions to the special circumstances of the districts. The Government has, 
moreover, charged itself with the more onerous duties in furtherance of the 
same object, by opening roads through the most difficult routes into all parts 
of the country, to facilitate transport and commerce, and to enable the miner 
to pursue his arduous labors with success. Three lines of roads have been 
successfully carried through the last range, and mining districts five hundred 
miles from the sea have been rendered accessible by routes hitherto unknown. 
The extension and improvement of works so pressingly required and in- 
dispensable to the improvement and development of the country, still claims 
the anxious care of the Government. The greatest difficulty was experienced 
in providing funds to meet the necessarily large expenditure on those works, 
and that object was accomplished by imposing an import duty on goods, as 
the only feasible means of producing a revenue adequate to the public exigen- 
cies. It was justly supposed that any tax directly levied on the mining popu- 
lation, would lead to clamor and discontent, without being productive of 
revenue ; whereas the indirect tax is not felt as a burden, and, I believe, makes 
no appreciable difference in the price which miners have to pay for their sup- 
plies. 

" I have entered into the foregoing review of the administrative sys- 
tems adopted in British Columbia and Vancouver Island, in answer to the 
assertion of the memorialists, that every exertion is made to stimulate the 
progress of Vancouver Island, at the expense of British Columbia, and to 



188 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

prove that my measures have ever been calculated to promote, to the fullest 
extent, the substantial interests of both colonies." 

The Views of the Home Government. 

From a practical point of view the foregoing was a complete answer to 
the memorialists, and yet Sir James overlooked the fact that the spirit of the 
times was completely in antagonism to his attitude. He was right, and yet 
he failed to appreciate that nine-tenths of the people of British Columbia 
were educated in the school of popular government. Douglas had lived his 
life among the western wilds in an atmosphere of one-man government, per- 
fect and absolute in its mechanical details, but wholly out of harmony with 
the institutions of its people. It was as perfectly hopeless to expect the Im- 
perial Government to deny British Columbians the right of representative gov- 
ernment as it was foolish and suicidal in a past century to have antagonized 
the American colonies in their aspirations for greater freedom of commerce. 
It was, therefore, only a question of time when the Home Government would 
grant to the memorialists their request. We are only surprised that it took 
two years for Douglas to be apprised of the decision of the authorities to 
make important changes in the system of administration in British Colum- 
bia. In a dispatch dated May 26th, 1863, the Duke of Newcastle informed 
Douglas that the act for the government of British Columbia would expire 
in a year and that it was proposed to make provision for a Legislative Council 
and for separate governors for the colonies of British Columbia and Van- 
couver Island. It was, however, made plain that the Home authorities had 
in mind the union of the two colonies as soon as public sentiment was pre- 
pared for it. The Duke'of Newcastle expressed confidence that economy and 
efficiency would be promoted, that commerce would be facilitated, that politi- 
cal capacity would be developed, that the strength of the colonies would be 
consolidated, and that generally their well-being would be greatly advanced 
by union. The representations made by Governor Douglas, had, however, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 189 

considerable weight in Downing Street, because, the dispatch went on to say, 
that while the authorities would have been pleased to give British Columbia 
the same representative institutions which existed in Vancouver Island, it 
was felt that that under present conditions would be impossible. Some of the 
circumstances referred to by Douglas were recited. 

" Under these circumstances," His Grace remarked, " I see no mode 
of establishing a purely representative legislature, which would not be open 
to one of two objections. Either it must place the Government of the colony 
under the exclusive control of a small circle of persons, naturally occupied 
with their own local, personal or class interests, or it must confide a large 
amount of political power to immigrant, or other transient foreigners, who 
have no permanent interest in the prosperity of the colony. 

" For these reasons I think it necessary that the government should re- 
tain, for the present, a preponderating influence in the Legislature. From the 
best information I can obtain, I am disposed to think it most advisable, that 
about one-third of the Council should consist of the Colonial Secretary and 
other officers, who generally compose the Executive Council; about one-third 
of magistrates from different parts of the colony; and about one-third of 
persons elected by the residents of the different electoral districts. But here 
I am met by the difficulty that these residents are not only few and scattered, 
but (like the foreign gold diggers) migratory and unsettled, and that any 
definition of electoral districts now made, might, in the lapse of a few months, 
become wholly inapplicable to the state of the colony. It would, therefore, 
be trifling to attempt such a definition, nor am I disposed to rely on any un- 
tried contrivance which might be suggested for supplying its place — con- 
trivances which depend for their success on a variety of circumstances, which, 
with my present information, I cannot safely assume to exist. 

" By what exact process this quasi-representation shall be accomplished, 
whether by ascertaining informally the sense of the residents in each locality, 
or by bringing the question before public meetings, or (as is done in Ceylon) 



190 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

by accepting the nominee of any corporate body or society, I leave you to 
determine. What I desire is this, that a system of virtual though imperfect 
representation shall at once be introduced, which shall enable Her Majesty's 
Government to ascertain, with some certainty, the character, wants and dis- 
position of the community with a view to the more formal and complete es- 
tablishment of a representative system, as circumstances shall admit of it. 
* * * With these explanations, I have to instruct you first to proclaim 
a law securing to Her Majesty the right to allot the above salaries to the of- 
ficials of British Columbia; and, having done so, to give publicity to the en- 
closed Order-in-Council and to convene as soon as possible, the proposed 

Legislature." 

The Pioneer Legislature. 

And a Legislative Council on the lines indicated in the Duke of New- 
castle's despatch was convened. It consisted of officials of the colony, of 
magistrates and of elected representatives in about equal numbers. The 
first council came into existence in 1863 and sat for the year 1864. The 
members were: The Hon. Arthur Birch, Colonial Secretary; Hon. Henry 
P. P. Crease (afterwards Sir Henry), Attorney-General; Hon. Wymond 
O. Hamley, Collector of Customs; Hon. Chartres Brew, Magistrate, New 
Westminster; Hon. Peter O'Reilly, Magistrate, Cariboo East; Hon. E. H. 
Sanders, Magistrate, Yale; Hon. H. M. Ball, Magistrate, Lytton; Hon. J. R. 
Homer, New Westminster; Hon. Robt. T. Smith, Hope, Yale and Lytton; 
Hon. Henry Holbrook, Douglas and Lillooet; Hon. James Orr, Cariboo 
East; Hon. Walter S. Black, Cariboo West; Mr. Chas. Goode, who mar- 
ried a daughter of Sir James Douglas, was clerk or secretary of the Council. 

Of these pioneer legislators, two are still living; so also is the Clerk, 
Hon. Mr. Hamley, for some years Collector of Customs at Victoria after the 
union of the colonies, is in retirement at the capital; Hon. Arthur N. Birch, 
subsequent to his leaving British Columbia, was appointed to an important 
position in Ceylon, was knighted, and is now living in London, England, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 191 

as agent of the Bank of England. Mr, Goode is living in England. Four 
of the number died within a year of the writing, Hon. Peter O'Reilly, who 
was for many years Indian Commissioner for the province; Sir Henry P. P. 
Crease, who was knighted after retiring from the Supreme Court Bench; 
Hon. E. H. Sanders, in California, and Hon. James Orr, the last of the 
number to be laid away. Lt. Col. R. Wolfenden, who was Queen's printer 
in those days and the first to serve Her Majesty in that capacity in British 
Columbia, is still in harness, the only difference being that he is printer to His 
Majesty instead of Her Majesty. The others have long been memories 
among the shades of the band of pioneers, who left this coast for the shores 
of the hereafter. 

About this time took place an event of some note. The terms of office 
of James Douglas as Governor of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, 
respectively, expired almost concurrently, they being but a few months apart. 
Those few months remaining of his term in British Columbia he de- 
cided to spend in New Westminster, to which place he removed in the fall 
of 1863. He was the recipient of many marks of esteem and respect on the 
part of the citizens of both the Island and the Mainland, from whom he 
received testimonials and by whom he was banquetted. In addition to that, 
however, his services in his public capacity were rewarded by the distinction 
of knighthood, the first recipient of such a title on the Pacific coast; and 
here, perhaps, is the place for a word as to the qualities and qualifications of 
the founder of the most westerly province in the Dominion of Canada. The 
editor of the British Colonist at the time the official news of knighthood 
was received, who was no less than Amor de Cosmos, a strong opponent of 
the government as administered by Sir James — and a remarkable man in 
his way — had this to say : " If we have opposed the measures of the Gov- 
ernment, we have never in our public acts of the executive head of that 
Government failed in our esteem for the sterling honesty of purpose which 



192 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

has guided those acts, nor for the manly and noble qualities and virtues 
which adorn the man." 

Sir James Douglas. 

Sir James was, perhaps, the most remarkable man that has appeared in 
the public arena in the province of British Columbia. A Scotchman by 
descent through the line of the Black Douglas, educated in Scotland, and 
associated for his earlier years with the members of the Northwest Com- 
pany, who were his countrymen, he both inherited and acquired many of 
those distinguishing characteristics which seem to reflect the ruggedness and 
strength of their native mountains, and much of the picturesqueness and 
charm of Caledonian scenery. Sir James Douglas was a large man physically 
and mentally. He had strength alike of physique and character. Although 
at the age of sixteen he sought the wilds of the Northwest in the employ of 
a fur company, he had had a liberal education, and throughout his career 
he aimed to increase his stock of knowledge and increase his accomplish- 
ments. He retained and strengthened the moral rectitude of his youth. In 
his principles he represented the old-fashioned punctiliousness in regard to 
details of all kinds, with progressive and far-seeing views of business and 
public policy. He combined a genius for business with a love of nature, 
of family, of literature, of devotion. His love of order, his respect for 
the conventionalities of office, his becoming self-respect, gave rather too 
much the impression of pompous display and an assertion of superiority, 
both of which were foreign to his nature. Sir James loved to magnify the 
office, but not the man. He was a strong, masterful man, with the faults 
that such men have — ^a tendency to rule with too firm a hand, to brook no 
opposition, to be perhaps overbearing, traits which were developed unusu- 
ally under the one-man rule of the Hudson's Bay Company, and necessary 
in the conditions under which that wonderful corporation carried on its 
operations over a vast extent of the New World. He had a good mastery

of French, which he spoke fluently with a correct accent ; had a wide knowl- 
edge of history and political economy; conversed with ease and entertain- 
ingly; rose early and rode and walked a great deal; was tenderly devoted 
to his family; was constant in religions exercises; assiduous in the perform- 
ance of official duties ; and generally was a man who acted well his part in 
life and did honor to his high position in the state. Of splendid physical 
proportions and herculean strength, he had an imposing presence. He pos- 
sessed the quality of personal m.agnetism in a high degree, and exercised 
corresponding influence with all with whom he came in contact. Cool, 
calculating and cautious, he was also courageous and prompt to act, com- 
bining the dominating characteristics of Anglo-Saxon and Celt. When he 
retired he still possessed considerable vigor of mind and body, and might 
still have continued to take an active part in the affairs of the country; 
but he had probably reached that stage in the development of the province 
at which he was more in spirit with the past than the present, where others 
more in harmony with new conditions would rule with greater acceptance 
to the people. He had acted a part in affairs that redounded highly to his 
credit and to the welfare of a budding colony, with tact, intelligence, rare 
ability, and high conception of and conscientious application to duty. Had 
his early training been in the field of politics and his lot been cast in a wider 
and more important sphere he could have and undoubtedly would have 
taken a place in history. He had the qualifications which make men of mark. 
In estimating him as a man and as an official we must judge him by the 
success he achieved in the sphere in which he moved. His record in that 
respect was the best possible. 

When he retired from public life, accepting his well-earned honors, he 
visited his native land. He went to England by way of Panama, and after 
spending some time in Great Britain, visited the continent, through the 
countries of which he made a leisurely circuit, and returned to his adopted 
and ultimate home in British Columbia, for which he had an ardent attach- 



194 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ment, after about a year's absence. His impressions of bis travels, as re- 
corded in bis journal, are most interesting readingf and tbrow many luminous 
side-ligbts on bis cbaracter and qualities. He lived in retirement witb his 
family in Victoria until August 2nd, 1877, upon wbicb day deatb came as 
a hasty and unexpected messenger to call him to his final home. He lives 
gratefully in the memory of the older inhabitants of the province. He is 
also remembered by a monument of stone in the grounds of the Parliament 
buildings at the capital, and his statue occupies a niche at one side of their 
main entrance, a corresponding niche being filled by another commanding 
figure, that of the late Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, whose selection to bracket 
with that of Sir James was wisely made by the designers of that splendid 
structure, adorning the sward " across James Bay." 

Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie. 

Sir Matthew was one of the remarkable characters, and a notable 
figure, of British Columbia history. He was Chief Justice from his appoint- 
ment in 1859 until the day of his death, June nth, 1894. Even a brief 
outline of the founding and development of the western province of Canada 
would be incomplete without a pen sketch of a man who so strongly im- 
pressed his character upon the administration of justice, notable for its 
completeness and effectiveness at a tirne when firmness was most needed. 
This is furnished by the late Sir Henry Crease, for many years a colleague 
on the bench : 

" Accompanied by his faithful henchman, Benjamin Evans, who drove 
the Court over twenty times from Yale or Ashcroft (after the C. P. R. 
reached it) to Cariboo and back without an accident, and his trusty friend, 
Charles Edward Pooley, as Registrar, he traversed the province wherever 
it was necessary in the interests of law or justice to go. His unflinching 
administration of the law from the outset of the colony in 1858 to his death 
in 1894, at a time when — mixed with a great many good men, it is true — 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 195 

the miners and the class of men who came with them comprised many of 
the wildest characters under the sun, whose sole arbitrament in their quar- 
rels in other countries had been knife and revolver, struck such terror into 
wrong-doers and defiers of the law from his first assize at Langley in. 1859, 
to the time of his death, that the peace of the country was thoroughly se- 
cured — and the wilder spirits were tamed to such an extent that even in 
difficult cases the court relied confidently on their assistance under a short 
special enactment, as jurors, and was never disappointed of their aid when 
so invoked. Tlie result was that the whole of the country could be traversed 
from end to end by all men without weapons, except sufficient to protect 
themselves from wild animals or for subsistence — a course in which he was 
effectually supported from first to last by all the judges who sat with or 
have succeeded him, to the great benefit, as the statute hath it, of person 
and property and the peace, order, and good government of the colony. He 
was a man over six feet (six feet four) in height, strong, and active in 
proportion, a good sportsman and an excellent shot. His abilities and his 
accomplishments were of the highest order, and his hospitality and his social 
qualities gained him fast friends in every direction. So take him for all 
in all we shall not often lock upon his like again." 

Union and the Capital. 

Really Douglas did not lay down the reins of office until the spring of 
1864, when his successors arrived — Arthur Kennedy as Governor of Van- 
couver Island, in March, and Frederick Seymour, formerly Governor of Brit- 
ish Honduras, in April, as Governor of British Columbia. The decision to 
appoint separate Governors for the colonies was in deference to local feeling 
on the Mainland. Governor Douglas, of course, had his official residence in 
Victoria, where he and his family had always resided since their removal from 
Fort Vancouver ; and the other leading officials of British Columbia also pre- 
ferred to live in Victoria. As might be expected it constituted a grievance 



196 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

on the part of the people of New Westminster, then the leading and prac- 
tically the only town of any importance on the Mainland. Sectional feeling 
was even then strong; it was still more embittered subsequently, and has not 
completely died out until the present day. With the division of the governor- 
ship was linked a permanent and definite basis for the civil list for both col- 
onies. With the arrangement for separate governors and separate civil lists 
was associated the desire expressed on the part of the Imperial authorities to 
see the colonies united under one government, and upon this point the views 
of both Governors Kennedy and Seymour were sought. 

In considering the question of union, it may be stated briefly that the 
majority of people on the Island of Vancouver, and especially in Victoria, 
were in favor of it. The majority of residents of the Upper Mainland, who 
as a rule had their starting point at Victoria, and who when they came to the 
coast wintered there, were also in favor of the Island capital. It was the 
centre of business and government at that time, and was then as it is now a 
very desirable place of residence. The Lower Mainland, however, and in 
particular, the city of New Westminster, was opposed to the proposed union. 
As to which place should be the capital was really at the bottom of the issue, 
and even when not brought into the discussion was ever present in the minds 
of both parties. New Westminster feared, owing to the larger jxDpulation, 
greater influence and enhanced attractions of Victoria, that it would be 
chosen, and the people of Victoria for similar reasons were, confidently hope- 
ful that it would be. Governor Kennedy reports the majority of the House 
of Assembly of Vancouver Island as " in favor of unconditional union with 
British Columbia," and while the Legislative Council did not care to express 
an opinion, he was nevertheless in a position to state that nearly all, if not 
all of the ex-oMcio members were also in favor. He avoided the question of 
the location of the capital, but stated that " I have abstained from expressing 
any public opinion, or exercising any influence I may possess, in encouraging 
this movement, but I have no doubt that the expression of the former and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 197 

legitimate use of the latter, if acquiesced in by Governor Seymour, would 
immediately remove all serious opposition to a union of these colonies, which 
I consider a matter of great Imperial, as well as colonial interest." 

Governor Seymour's views of the subject are somewhat in doubt. In 
a despatch to the Home Government, he expresses the opinion that union 
with Vancouver Island is not desired in British Columbia, His sympathies 
were entirely with the city, where he had his official residence. He says : 
" In the event of union taking place, a question which will locally excite some 
interest is as to the seat of government. Victoria is the largest town of the 
two colonies, and is, in many respects, the most agreeable place of residence. 
I think, however, in seeking union with British Columbia, she relinquishes all 
claims to the possession within her limits of the seat of government. New 
Westminster has been chosen as the capital of British Columbia, and it would 
not be fair to the reluctant colony to deprive her of the Governor and staff 
officers. Both of these towns are inconveniently situated on an angle of 
the vast British territory; but New Westminster on the Mainland, has the 
advantage over the island town. It is already the centre of the telegraphic 
system, and is in constant communication with the upper country, whereas 
the steamers to Victoria only run twice a week. The seat of government 
should be on the Mainland; whether it might with advantage be brought, 
hereafter, nearer to the gold mines is a question for the future." It may be 
interesting to note in this connection that years after, when the colony of 
British Columbia had become a province of the Dominion and the question 
of erecting the present new Parliament buildings was before the country, a 
suggestion was strongly supported in the upper country that the capital should 
be removed to Kamloops, as being strategically safer in case of war and 
more central. Doubtless, Kamloops, in a period of hostility, would afford 
the necessary security, and would be a delightful site for a capitol building, 
but considering the vast extent of territory to the northward opening up and 
to be opened by railways, it would be anything but a central location. Future 



198 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

g-enerations will probably agree that, taking all in all, Victoria was well 
chosen for the purpose. 

The subject of union continued to be a live issue, for a time practically 
the only public issue of importance. There were petitions and counter peti- 
tions. Finally, union, strongly supported by the Imperial authorities, took 
place and went into effect on the 17th of November, 1866. The matter of 
the selection of a capital, however, was not then settled. Governor Seymour 
strongly opposed Victoria, and did not withdraw his opposition until the posi- 
tion of the Home Government was clearly defined and he advised the Legis- 
lative Council in 1868 to come to a decision and to assist him in so doing. 
The decision was in favor of Victoria, where the first united Parliament of 
British Columbia sat in that year, and continued to sit for ever afterwards. 
Governor Seymour stated in his speech at the opening of the Legislative 
Council in the year referred to that Her Majesty's Government was of the 
opinion that he had held an extreme view as: to the extent to which the public 
faith and honor are pledged to the purchasers of land in New Westminster. 
Undoubtedly a great many persons had been induced to buy property in New 
Westminster on the strength of its being selected as the capital of a new 
colony, but upon the union of the two colonies, which was without any doubt 
advantageous from many points of view, it was necessary to select or reject 
one of the two capitals. Victoria at the time was by far the most important 
point of the two, and the Home Government regarded " public convenience 
as the main guide in the selection of a seat of government." Sir Henry 
Crease states that " those who on the faith of the royal proclamation staked 
their all were simply ruined, without redress or compensation, leaving behind 
a wound and a sense of deliberate injustice in the minds of the Mainland 
against the Island that has never been entirely healed, although the reason 
given that it was necessary to consolidate not only to save the unnecessary 
expense of two governments and two sets of officers where one would do, 
especially to prepare for Confederation, was not without great weight." 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 199 

The question of Confederation with Canada was also mixed up with 
that of union of the two colonies and the fixing- of a place as capital. At 
the very time when an effort was being made to unite British Columbia and 
Vancouver Island on the Pacific coast, a similar movement was on foot on 
the Atlantic side of the continent to bring together in one federation the sep- 
arate British colonies there. Though far removed from the old Canadas and 
separated by almost insuperable physical obstacles, the sentiment of the east 
began to be reflected in the west, more especially as the scheme of Confedera- 
tion completed in 1867 made provision for the bringing in of British Co- 
lumbia, and we shall tell in the next chapter how that was brought about.* 

Story of Confederation. 

Confederation came about in a way in British Columbia entirely different 
from that in any of the other provinces. It is scarcely necessary to review the 
events which led up to the union of four provinces in 1867. Although the 
Maritime Provinces wanted an alliance of their own, they did not take kindly 
to one with Canadians, as the inhabitants of Ontario and Quebec were then 
exclusively known, and it was only by political strategy that it was accom- 
plished in the case of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, while Prince Edward 
Island remained out for some time after. Quebec at heart was not with the 
movement, although she joined hands with Ontario, having first fixed her 
representation. Manitoba cost the Dominion a rebellion. Her entry into 
the Federal compact was badly managed, and an unnecessary grievance cre- 
ated, which prejudiced the cause for the time being. In the east Confed- 
eration arose largely out of a sentiment of unity. It was an idea — a grand 
consummation into the accomplishment of which the leaders of both parties 
entered with enthusiasm. There were many diverse elements and interests 

* The story of Confederation as given in the following pages was first prepared 
ill 1896, and was published in the Vancouyer World, and subsequently in the Year Book 
of British Columbia. It is a very necessary part of the narrative, in fact, one of the 
most interesting and im.portant in the history of the Province. As the author feels that 
he has given his best efforts to it. and cannot hope to materially improve it, the 
chapter has been carefully revised and reproduced. 



200 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

to consider, many difficulties in the way, but there were also many obvious 
disadvantages in remaining apart ; and when the fathers of Confederation had 
made up their minds to succeed and went seriously to work, the difficulties 
were soon overcome. It was an experiment at first, and no man could con- 
fidently predict the outcome. There were local irritations, provincial preju- 
dices and weighty obligations to make good. For a time not a few able, 
conscientious and truly loyal men, who subsequently became good Canadians 
and heartily acquiesced, looked on with misgivings and gravely doubted the 
wisdom of the experiment. If, however, the British possessions in North 
America were to remain British, Confederation was inevitable. Amalgama- 
tion and structural organization were rapidly going on on the United States 
side of the line, and such a political force could only be counterbalanced and 
restricted by a similar movement on this side. In the east, therefore, as has 
been intimated, the stimulus to Confederation was political and national, 
and was so in spite of local considerations. Manitoba, on the other hand, 
was a territorial purchase, and was virtually created at the time of its union 
with the other provinces, and had it not been for the community of Metis, 
whose fears were inspired by an ambitious zealot, abetted by a few American 
citizens, there would have been nothing either in the way of local interests or 
sentimental objections to have interfered. 

In British Columbia the conditions were entirely different from, and 
the considerations of a nature totally unlike those which affected the eastern 
half of Canada. Geographically, the Crown Colony was far removed from 
the seat of Government. An almost insuperable barrier of mountains cut it 
off from the rest of the British possessions. A vast, unbroken and prac- 
tically uninhabited plain separated it from the nearest province. Politically 
or socially, the influences of Eastern Canada did not extend to within a thou- 
sand miles of its extremest boundary eastward. There was absolutely no 
land communication, and, apart from Hudson's Bay Company fur caravans, 
only one or two parties had ever come overland. There were comparatively 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 201 

few Canadian-born residents, and these were mainly among the pioneers who 
had left their native place while Confederation sentiment was still in its in- 
fancy, and who had formed new associations, and, to some extent, new ideals 
and objects in life. The population was largely British-born, with not a few 
Americans interspersed. The country, in its physical configuration, its re- 
sources, its requirements, was in every sense foreign to Canada. Communi- 
cation and trade were wholly with the Pacific Coast and Great Britain, and 
sympathies to a considerable extent followed in the line of trade and travel. 
It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that there was an important element 
opposed to Confederation at the outset. 

The mainspring, however, was not sentimentalism. It was not with the 
idea of rounding off Confederation, or building up a commonwealth from 
ocean to ocean, with a common organic structure and a common destiny — 
nothing of the kind. While there were prominent men in the colony, like 
the late Hon. John Robson, F. J. Barnard, and the Hon. Amor de Cosmos, 
who hailed from Canada, and who were no doubt imbued with aspirations of 
a kind that directed the movement in the east, yet the mass of the population 
was not influenced by such considerations, and that was the most natural 
thing in the world. It could not have been expected to be otherwise. Dr. 
Helmcken, who opposed Confederation conscientiously as well as ably, during 
the debate to go into committee on the terms submitted by Governor Mus- 
grave, said with much force that " No union between this colony and Canada 
can permanently exist unless it be to the material and pecuniary advantage 
of this colony to remain in the Union. The sum of the interests of the in- 
habitants is the interest of the colony. The people of this colony have, gen- 
erally speaking, no love for Canada. They care, as a rule, little or nothing 
about the creation of another empire, kingdom or republic. They have but 
little sentimentality, and care little or nothing about the distinctions between 
the form of Government of Canada and that of the United States. There- 
fore, no union on account of love need be looked for. The only bond of 



202 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

union, outside of force — and force the Dominion has not — ^will be the ma- 
terial advantage of the country and pecuniary benefit of the inhabitants. Love 
for Canada has to be acquired by the prosperity of the country and from our 
children." 

Dr. Helmcken did not represent the feelings of British Columbia in 
so far as the desire for Confederation was concerned. To rightly under- 
stand the feelings of the people on the subject we have to go back to the 
conditions of the time. The situation has already been described, which 
in one word, in relation to Canada, was isolation. The circumstances, 
however, were these: The Province was heavily in debt, the liabilities being 
around $1,500,000 for about 10,000 white people. The after effects of the 
Cariboo gold fever were being experienced. Prosperity had vanished, times 
were depressed, money was scarce, and there were no prospects ahead except 
the chance of new gold fields being discovered. A great many people de- 
plored the loss of a free port, to which they attributed a good deal of their 
former prosperity. On the Mainland, w-here the Confederation movement 
was the strongest, there existed a keen dissatisfaction over the removal of 
the capital from Westminster. And so all around there was a desire for 
change. As a Crown Colony there were only two roads open which offered 
any hopes of betterment — Confederation or Annexation. While there was 
a slight movement in the latter direction, and a petition had been gotten up 
in its favor, signed mainly by Americans ; and, while there was a modicum 
of truth in what Dr. Helmxken said about the majority of people caring 
little about the distinctions as to the form of government of Canada and 
the United States, yet British Columbia was essentially loyal to British insti- 
tutions and to the British flag. As a political possibility annexation was 
not to be thought of, and the sentiments expressed by the fathers of Confed- 
eration in British Columbia, in the debate referred to, showed to what 
small extent the annexation movement had influenced public opinion; union 
with Canada, if it meant no more than continued connection with the mother 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 203 

country, in that respect was unobjectionable at least. It was, in fact, prefer- 
able to annexation. Isolation seemed to be hopeless and unendurable. Change 

was necessary. 

The C. p. R. as a Factor. 

For some years before, the subject of a trans-continental railway ha*d been 
much discussed, both in Great Britain and Canada, and with the writings of 
prominent men on this subject British Columbians were familiar; because, 
as a class they were educated, intelligent and well-informed — highly superior 
to any similar number of m.en in the other provinces — a fact easily accounted 
for. Many were graduates of universities and well connected, a select com- 
pany of adventurers, so to speak. A railway from ocean to ocean was a 
popular theme. It opened up new vistas of possibilities not only for Can- 
ada, but the Empire. To Canadians it meant a chain to bind the discon- 
nected British possessions together; it meant an outlet to and inlet from 
the West; it disclosed a new Dominion of great magnitude and promise. 
It was a subject brimful of opportunity for the eloquence of oratory and 
the pen-picturing of the essayist. To Great Britain it afforded that alterna- 
tive route of commerce long sought for in the North-West passage, for 
the discovery of which her seamen had been diligent and persistent ; and 
for military transport in case of war. It is not easy to give due credit for 
the first advocacy of a Canadian trans-continental railway. It goes quite far 
back in Canadian history. It was discussed by Judge Haliburton, and was a 
dream of Hon. Joseph Howe. We find a route well defined in an article 
that was contributed by an ofiicer of the " Thames City," which brought 
out a detachment of the Royal Engineers and Sappers &amp; Miners in 1859, 
to a paper published on board. Curiously enough, the route then indicated, 
was the one that was subsequently followed in actual construction. As a 
matter of fact, the project at various times was widely discussed. Like so 
many other great enterprises of national importance, it was a long time in 
the public mind before it assumed concrete form. In British Columbia, 



204 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. Alfred Waddington was the first and foremost advocate. He was an 
enthusiast on the subject and devoted much of his time and energy to acquir- 
ing information and in an agitation for a railway via Bute Inlet. Begg's 
history of British Columbia contains the following reference to his later 
efforts*: " Mr. Waddington proceeded to London, and petitioned the House 
of Commons, in the interests of British Columbia. His first petition of the 
29th of May, 1868, was signed by himself; the second (3rd July) was pre- 
sented by Viscount Milton. It was largely signed by parties connected 
with British Columbia, and showed that that Colony was ' for all practical 
purposes, isolated from the Mother Country, and surrounded by a foreign 
state, and great national difficulties ' ; that it was ' entirely indebted to the 
United States for the carriage of its letters and emigrants, and almost en- 
tirely for the carriage of goods required for trade and domestic purposes: 
that a graving dock was required; that it was of great public importance 
to secure the advantages of an overland communication through British 
North America, which would be the shortest and best route to China, Japan 
and the East; that the overland communication sought for would perpetuate 
the loyal feelings of the colony, and that a line of steam communication from 
Panama to Vancouver Island should in the meantime be subsidized.' Mr. 
Waddington after remaining in London until 1869, returned to Ottawa, 
and continued to advocate the construction of a trans-continental railway, 
until after Confederation. He sold the plans of his overland route through 
British Columbia to the Dominion Government in August, 187 1. He died 
in Ottawa of smallpox in February, 1872." 

As Confederation was the order of the day, and was being successfully 
accomplished, the people of British Columbia were not slow to sec that in 
the undertaking of such an enterprise lay their hopes for the future. With 
a railway having one terminus at Halifax and the other on the shores of 
the Pacific, they recognized the importance of their position geographically 
and commercially — a position which in annexation would only and always 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 205 

be secondary to San Francisco, but in Confederation second to none. In 
all the political habiliments, paraphernalia and belonging's, clothingf, surround- 
ing, and attaching to Confederation the one main object — ^the essence of it 
all was a railway — direct communication with the East. As Dr. Helmcken 
might have expressed it, they loved not Canada for what she was, but for 
what she would do for them. They noted the terms under which the other 
provinces had entered the Federal Union — debts assumed, allowances made 
for differences of degree and conditions, annual subsidies in lieu of existing 
revenues, provincial autonomy, and so on. They knew further the anxiety 
theie was to extend the Dominion of Canada westward to the Pacific Ocean. 
To be relieved of debt, to throw off the weight of an overweighty official- 
dom and to secure a railway and still possess the sovereign rights of self- 
government, by the one act of union, was a consummation devoutly to be 
wished. The people of British Columbia were wise in their day and gen- 
eration and knew or thought they knew, how to make a good bargain, and 
whatever may be the difference of opinion that exists to-day as to the posi- 
tion of this province in the Dominion, they flattered themselves, when the 
news came from Ottawa as to the outcome of the negotiations there, that 
they had done well. And who will say, considering the circumstances of the 
province at that time, and its impotency to do for itself what the Dominion 
Government had agreed to do for it, that the issue did not justify some 
measure of self-satisfaction? This is what it got: A railway 3,000 miles 
long to be begun within two years; $100,000 a year in lieu of lands to be 
given for railway in question; 80 cents per head of a population computed 
at 60,000; deliverance from $1,500,000 of debt; $500,000 for a dry dock 
at Esquimau ; superannuation of officials; $35,000 a year in support of 
the government; five per cent per annum on the difference between the debt 
and that of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick pro rata of the population; 
Indians to be cared for by the Dominion and nine representatives at Ottawa, 
three senators and six members in the House of Commons. In lieu of this 



206 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the province gave the land included in the railway belt, its customs and excise 
revenues, the control of the general affairs now within the jurisdiction of 
the Dominion Government, which then pertained to its colonial status. These 
terms were subsequently modified to some extent, favorably to the province, 
but not in any essential respect. 

Looking- at it from the standpoint of to-day it would be a difficult task 
indeed, and perhaps a not over-wise one, to decide as to which of the two 
parties to the negotiations really made the better bargain. Speculation would 
not be quite idle as to what this province would be standing alone as a 
Crown Colony; but we cannot come to a definite conclusion. Great life 
and energy have been imparted to the people and great development has re- 
sulted. The foundation has been laid for things many times greater in 
comparison, the magnitude of which we are not yet in a position to realize. 
It is true the province is paying a too substantial dividend to the Dominion 
for the latter's investment, and is under no financial obligations for the 
advantages it has derived. On the other hand, the Dominion, in order to 
carry out the terms of the bargain with British Columbia, assumed enormous 
obligations, under which she staggered for a time, but Canada to-day with- 
out the West would not rank higjher in the category of countries than one 
of the States of the American Union. With the prestige which a trans- 
continental line with its trans-Pacific connections has given her, with the 
markets that have been afforded to her manufacturers thereby, and the wealth 
that has been added to her domain, the taking of British Columbia into the 
family compact has constituted it the supreme achievement of Confederation. 

The Preliminary Steps. 

To come back to the starting point of Confederation in British Colum- 
bia; that may be said to have been the union of Vancouver Island with 
the Mainland. No doubt the dissatisfaction in the Westminster district over 
the removal of the capital had much to do in stimulating the movement, and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 207 

its foremost advocates belong to the Mainland. It is true that the Hon. 
Amor de Cosmos, in Victoria, had been among the first — if he was not 
indeed the first — to publicly advocate it in his paper, the " Standard." 

However, it first came prominently to the front during the session of 
1867, when a resolution was unanimously passed in its favor, requesting 
Gov. Seymour " to take measures without delay to secure the admission of 
British Columbia into the Confederation on fair and equitable terms." Gov. 
Seymour, it may be remarked, was at first not favorably disposed to a union 
with Canada, and whatever his influence with the executive may have been 
in this regard is not known ; but at all events, when the session of the 
following year was held, little or no progress had been made in the direction 
indicated by the resolution in question, and, as a matter of fact, the mem- 
bers of the Government seemed to have changed their attitude in regard to 
it, and when the subject was again introduced it met with overwhelming 
opposition. As a result of the action taken, or rather, not taken, by the Ex- 
ecutive Council, an agitation was started throughout the country for the 
purpose of bringing it to an issue. 

At a meeting held in Victoria on January 29, 1868, a committee was 
appointed, consisting of Messrs. James Trimble, Amor de Cosmos, I. W. 
Powell, J. R. Findlay, R. Wallace and H. E. Seeley, who drew up and signed 
a memorial, which set forth, among other things, the resolution unanimously 
passed by the Legislative Council, already referred to; that a public meeting 
had been held at the same time expressing concurrent views with the Legis- 
lative Council; that the people of Cariboo had held in the previous Decem- 
ber a highly enthusiastic meeting, and unanimously passed a resolution in 
favor of immediately joining the Dominion; that public opinion was over- 
whelmingly in favor of Confederation; that there was only a small party 
other than Annexationists who were opposed; that nearly all the offices 
belonged to the latter party; that there was only a small party in favor of 
annexation to the L^nited States; that Governor Seymour had not made 



208 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

any representations to the Dominion Government asking for admission, as 
requested; that the Legislative Council, composed as it was of officials and 
others subject to the will of the Government, could not be depended upon 
to express the will of the people, and so on.. These and other representations 
were contained in the memorial which was addressed to the Dominion 
Government. 

Hon. S. L. Tilley, the Minister of Customs, sent the following reply, 
dated Ottawa, March 25, 1868 : " The Canadian Government desires union 
with British Columbia, and has opened communications, and suggests imme- 
diate action by your legislators and a passage of an address to Her Majesty 
requesting union with Canada. Keep us informed of progress." 

On the 2 1 St of May of the same year a Confederation Leagtie was formed 
in the city of Victoria, of which the following gentlemen formed the Execu- 
tive Committee: James Trimble (Mayor), Captain Stamp, Dr. Powell, J. F. 
(now Hon. Justice) McCreight, Robert Beaven, J. D. Norris, George 
Pearkes, R. Wallace, C. Gowen, M. W. Gibbs, Amor de Cosmos and George 
Fox. The League began with a membership of one hundred in Victoria, 
and branches were formed in several places on the Island and the Mainland. 

On July the ist of the same year, what was described as " a largely 
attended and spirited open-air meeting " was held at Barkerville, Cariboo, at 
which strong resolutions were passed unanimously condemning the Govern- 
ment for opposing Confederation and favoring " some organized and sys- 
tematic mode of obtaining admission into the Dominion of Canada." At 
this meeting Mr. J. S. Thompson, afterwards a member of Parliament, made 
an effective and eloquent speech in moving a resolution, which, by the way, 
was seconded by Mr. Cornelius Booth, late Supervisor of the Rolls for the 
Province. Before the meeting adjourned a committee of five was appointed 
to carry out the wishes of the meeting in furthering what had been advocated. 

The next most important step in the agitation was the holding on Sep- 
tember 14 the somewhat celebrated convention at Yale, at which most of the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 209 

• leading- men of the province were present. A committee was then appointed, 
composed of Hon. Amor de Cosmos, Messrs. Macmillan, Wallace and Norris, 
of Victoria; Hon. John Robson, New Westminster; and Hon. Hugh Nelson. 
of Burrard Inlet, to carry out the objects of the Convention. The proceed- 
ings of this Convention were very much criticised at the time, and were the 
subject of not a little ridicule on the part of those who were opposed to the 
movement. 

At the next meeting of the Legislature, in 1869, the question was again 
brought up, with the result that the Government carried an adverse resolution 
as follows : " That this Council, impressed with the conviction that under 
existing circumstances the Confederation of this colony with the Dominion 
of Canada would be undesirable, even if practicable, would urge upon Her 
Majesty's Government not to take any steps toward the present consumma- 
tion of such union." Messrs. Carrall, Robson. Havelock, Walkem and 
Humphreys, who stated that they had been returned as Confederationists^ 
entered a protest against the passage of the resolution, and placed on record 
their disapproval of the action of the Government. 

Despite the attitude taken by the Government, events about this time 
began to hasten that which facilitated in rather an unexpected way the bring- 
ing about of Confederation. There was considerable talk of annexation on 
the part of, it is true, an inconsiderable minority of American citizens, and a 
petition which was circulated and signed principally by the latter, was sent 
to the President of the United States, praying for admission into the Union. 
In June of that year Governor Seymour, whose sympathies and influences 
during the preliminary portion of the agitation for Confederation had been 
on the side of those who were opposed to it, but whose opposition, we are 
led to understand, was subsequently withdrawn — the result of his visit to 
England — died. Anthony Musgrave, whose instructions were to bring about 
Confederation as speedily as possible, in conformity with the Imperial policy, 
succeeded him. Governor Musgrave, we are told. " was admirably fitted for 



210 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the work of reconciling the opposing elements, and his eflforts were easily 
successful." Since the time that the first resolution had passed the House, 
when it was unanimously agreed to, the events in Canada had led to a tem- 
porary damper in the enthusiasm at first displayed over Confederation. There 
was the dissatisfaction existing in Nova Scotia, which did not augur well 
for the success of the Union, and the trouble in Manitoba, which at the time 
the Legislative Council sat, in 1870, had not yet l)een settled satisfactorily. 
These no doubt created unrest in the minds of some of the leading men in 
the colony, especially in Victoria, as to the wisdom of joining hands with the 
Dominion while as yet Confederation was, so to speak, only in the experi- 
mental stage. There were in British Columbia indications of improvement 
of the situation, owing to mining excitement, the result of new discoveries, 
and it was thought by some, notably Dr. Helmcken, that it would be better 
to wait a little longer in order to judge more accurately of the results of 
Confederation in the other provinces, and in case of times improving, as 
seemed probable, British Columbia would be in a better position to demand 
her own terms than if she went into the Union on the first invitation. 

However, Governor Musgrave was anxious to carry out his instructions, 
and no doubt wished to have the honor of bringing the matter to a successful 
issue during his term of office, and he succeeded, as we shall see, in bringing 
the Executive to his way of thinking. Prior to the session of 1870 he had, 
with his Council, framed resolutions to lay before them so as to enable him 
to deal with the Government of Canada. It was agreed that the terms of 
Union should not be finally accepted until ratified by the people, and authority 
was to be asked to reconstitute the Legislative Council, so as to allow the 
majority of its members to be formally returned for electoral districts, and 
thus obtain expression of opinion of the people of the colony. 

The terms of Union proposed by the Governor were, briefly : Canada 
to assume the debt of British Columbia; to pay $35,000 yearly for the sup- 
port of the local Government, and 80 cents per head of the population, to 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 211 

be rated at 120,000, the rate of 80 cents to be continued until the population 
reached 400,000, the subsidy thereafter to remain fixed; to commence at 
once the survey for a line of railway; to complete a wagon road to Lake 
Superior within three years after Confederation, and not less than $1,000,000 
to be spent in any one year in its construction; to guarantee 5 per cent in- 
terest on a loan of $500,000 for the construction of a graving dock at Esqui- 
malt: to provide fortnightly steam communication with San Francisco; to 
give regular communication with Nanaimo and the interior; to build and 
maintain a Marine Hospital, a Lunatic Asylum and a Penitentiary; to main- 
tain the Judiciary and the Postoffice and Customs services; to use its influ- 
ence to retain E^uimalt as a station for Her Majesty's ships and to establish 
a volunteer force; to provide a pension for the present officers of the Govern- 
ment ; and to allow interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum on the differ- 
ence between the actual amount of the indebtedness of the colony, per head 
of the population, rated at 120,000, and the indebtedness per head of the 

other provinces. 

The Debate on Confederation. 

On Wednesday. March 9, 1870, began the memorable debate on the 
subject of Confederation with Canada, when the then Attorney-General, 
Hon. (late Sir Henry P. P.) Crease, rose to move: "That this Council do 
now resolve itself into committee of the whole, to take into consideration 
the terms proposed for the Confederation of the Colony of British Columbia 
with the Dominion of Canada, in his excellency's message to this Council." 
" In doing so," he said, " I am deeply impressed with the momentous char- 
acter of the discussion into which we are about to enter, the grave impor- 
tance of a decision by which the fate of this, our adopted country' of British 
Columbia, must be influenced for better or for worse, for all time to come. 
And I earnestly hope that bur minds and best energies may be bent to a 
task which w-ill tax all our patriotism, all our forbearance, all our abnegation 
of self and selfish aims; to combine all our individual powers into one great 



212 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

united effort for the common good." He then invoked the Divine blessing 
in the follov^^ing- words : " May He who holds the fate of nations in the 
hollow of His hand, and crowns with success, or brings to naught the coun- 
cils of men, guide all our deliberations to such an issue as shall promote the 
peace, honor and welfare of our most Gracious Sovereign, and of this and 
all other portions of her extended realms." His speech in introducing the 
resolution above was brief, but lucid and eloquent. " This issue is," he re- 
marked, " Confederation or no Confederation," and pungently added, " Your 
question, Mr. President, that I do now leave the chair, means: That is the 
issue before us now." Thus was launched a discussion which, vigorously 
conducted for a number of days, landed the Province of British Columbia 
in the arms of the Dominion. 

The debate to go into Committee of the Whole lasted three days, and 
nine days were occupied in discussing the details in committee. Some nota- 
ble speeches were made, and probably no debate since that time brought into 
requisition greater talent, or better sustained and more dignified oratory in 
the Legislative Assembly. They were able men, some of them, who took 
part, and all the speakers were prominent in the affairs of the country. 
Among them were Attorney-General Crease, Dr. Helmcken, Amor de Cos- 
mos, Thomas Humphreys, M. W. T. Drake, John Robson, Joseph Trutch, 
Hy Holbrook, T. L. Wood, F. J. Barnard, R. W. W. Carrall, E. Dewdney, 
G. A. Walkem — nearly all of whom are familiar to the newest comers as 
men having a high place in the affairs of the province. It would be impos- 
sible in a limited space to give even in outline the salient points in the debate. 

Following the Honorable the Attorney-General came Dr. Helmcken, 
from whom the principal opposition arose. In the course of his remarks he 
said : " The honorable gentleman laid great stress upon the consolidation 
of British interests on this coast; but I say, sir, that however much we are 
in favor of consolidating British interests, our own must come first. Im- 
perial interests can well afford to wait. We are invited to settle this ques- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 213 

tion now and forever; but I say that we are not called upon to do so. The 
matter will come before the people after the proposed terms have been sub- 
mitted to the Dominion Government; and it will very likely happen that if 
these terms were rejected and others of a mean nature substituted by the 
Government of Canada for the consideration of the people of this colony, 
other issues may come up at the polls, and amongst them the question whether 
there is no other place to which this colony can go but Canada. Whatever 
may be the result of the present vote, it is impossible to deny the probability 
of the lesser being absorbed by the greater, and it cannot be regarded as im- 
probable that ultimately not only this colony but the whole of the Dominion 
of Canada will be absorbed by the United States." As has already been 
stated. Dr. Helmcken dwelt largely on the fact that the time was inopportune 
to open the question, because he indicated that the new gold discoveries 
would bring a large population to the province, and that the present depres- 
sion would be swept away, and that in that event the province would be in a 
better position to go to the Dominion and negotiate for terms. 

In noticing the drawbacks of the colony he said : " The United States 
hem us in on every side. It is the nation by which we exist. It is a nation 
which has made this colony what it is; but, nevertheless, it is one of our 
greatest drawbacks. We do not enjoy her advantages, nor do we profit 
much by them. We do not share her prosperity, and we are far too small 
to be rivals. The effect of a large body and a small body brought into con- 
tact is that the larger will adopt the smaller and ultimately absorb it. And 
again, I say so, sir; I say that the United States will probably ultimately 
absorb both this colony and the Dominion of Canada. Canada will, in all 
probability, desire quite as much to join her ultimately as we do now to join 
the Dominion." Dr. Helmcken also objected to the Canadian tariff, which 
was lower than that of British Columbia at the time, and consequently un- 
favorable to the development of the agricultural industry. This was a mat- 
ter that was very strongly dwelt upon by nearly all the members, and it was 



214 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

held that in arranging the terms the Dominion Government would be specially 
induced to look after the interests of this province and see that the farmers 
were protected from competition from the neighboring territory of Wash- 
ington and Oregon. The doctor held that Confederation would be inimical 
to nearly every interest of the province, and particularly to the farmers. He 
said it would be inimical to brewers, to the spar trade, to the fisheries, whaling 
pursuits and the lumber business. Of all the speeches delivered, his may be 
said to have been the most original. 

Hon. Mr. Drake, member for Victoria City, moved the six months' 
hoist, saying : " I need not state, sir, that I have always been opposed to 
Confederation. I have consistently opposed Federation on any terms up to 
the present time, and I do not see any reason now to change my opinion." 
Mr. Drake took very much the same line of objection as Dr. Helmcken. He 
spoke particularly in regard to the Canadian tariff, which he said would place 
the farmers of British Columbia at a very great disadvantage compared with 
those of the United States. He claimed that distance from Canada, small- 
ness of population, giving an insignificant representation in the Dominion 
Parliament, and the unsettled state of the intervening territory, would be in- 
superable barriers to the success of the scheme. The Hon. Mr. Ring, mem- 
ber for Nanaimo, seconded Mr. Drake's amendment, and spoke briefly. Hon. 
Mr. Robson, it is needless to say, though opposed to the Government, took 
a strong and patriotic position in favor of the original resolution. He al- 
ways favored Confederation. 

Perhaps the strongest speech was made by Hon. J. W. Trutch, Chief 
Commissioner of Lands and Works. His arguments were well presented, 
and his advocacy of Confederation moderate but firm. Regarding Canada, 
he said : '* I believe, sir, that many of the objections which have been raised 
to Confederation have arisen from prejudiced feelings. I have no reason to 
be prejudiced against or partial to Canada. I believe the Canadians as a 
people are no better than others, and no worse. I have no ties in Canada. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 215 

nor particular reason for entertaining any feeling of affection for Canada." 
He repudiated some suggestions of Hon. Mr. Drake as follows : " The 
honorable junior member for Victoria asks what guarantee have we that the 
terms will be carried out. I say at once, sir, if the terms are not carried out, 
if the Canadian Government repudiate their part of the agreement, we shall 
be equally at liberty to repudiate ours. We should, I maintain, be at liberty 
to repudiate Confederation." He considered the time was most opportune. 
He was in favor of the province having the right to make its own tariff, so 
as to protect its farming interests, and hailed with pleasure the salmon laws 
of Canada and advocated the rights of the Indians. Concluding, he said : 
" As we shall, from our position on the Pacific Coast, be the keystone of 
Confederation, I hope we may become the most glorious in the whole struct- 
ure, and tend to our own and England's future greatness." 

Hon. Mr. Wood was the next speaker. He supported in an able and 
argumentative speech the amendment for the six months' hoist. His objec- 
tions were, first, to the principles of the Organic Act of 1867, as applied to 
the British North American Provinces; second, to the special application of 
the principle to this province; third, to the mode in which the consent of its 
adoption was attempted to be obtained. Mr. Wood thought the principle 
of Confederation was bad in itself and would not work out successfully. He 
thought that Great Britain favored it from a selfish point of view, and not 
from considerations of broad statesmanship. With respect to British Co- 
lumbia his objections were: Remoteness, comparative insignificance, and 
diversity of interests. As to the third objection, the mode of bringing about 
Confederation, he objected to it as not appealing to moral or political con- 
siderations, but to pecuniary motives. In other words, the people were 
being bribed by promises of a railway and a dry dock rather than being con- 
vinced by political advantages. 

Hon. Amor de Cosmos made a long and vigorous though somewhat 
discursive speech. He claimed to be the first to advocate Confederation. 



216 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and as such condemned the Government for delaying so long. He remarked 
at the opening : " For many years I have regarded the union of the British 
Pacific territories, and of their consoHdation under one Government, as one 
of the steps preHminary to the grand consoHdation of the British Empire in 
North America. I still look upon it in this light with the pride and feeling 
of a native-born British American. From the time when I first mastered 
the institutes of physical and political geography I could see Vancouver 
Island on the Pacific from my home on the Atlantic; and I could see a time 
when the British possessions, from the United States boundary to the Arctic 
Ocean, and extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, would be consolidated 
into one great nation." Mr. De Cosmos incidentally remarked : " If I had 
my way, instead of the United States owning Alaska, it would have been 
British to-day." He laid great stress on the terms of Confederation and 
was anxious to make as good a money bargain as possible. On that ground 
he objected to the financial arrangements as submitted by the Government as 
not creating sufficient surplus of revenue, and also to the fiction, as he termed 
it. of assuming the population to be 120,000 instead of 40,000. It may be 
remarked here, incidentally, that the assumption of 120,000 as the popula- 
tion of British Columbia was based not on an estimate of the actual number 
of people, including Indians, in the province, but on the relative tariff reve- 
nue as compared with that of Canada, which was as three to one. In other 
words, it was estimated that as every individual paid three times in tariff 
imposts what was paid in Canada, the population should be figured as 120,000 
instead of 40,000. It is curious that the rate of revenue still maintains the 
same ratio. Our population is now 200,000. According to that method of 
figuring it should be 600,000 for the purpose of a subsidy. 

Hon. Mr. Ring again spoke, advocating that the people should have an 
opportunity of deciding upon the terms before it was discussed by the House. 

Mr. Barnard was the most enthusiastic supporter of Confederation, and 
he took up the subject, as he did anything in which he became interested, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 217 

with peculiar energy. Speaking- as a Canadian bom, he said : " I desire, 
before going- further, to allude to a charge commonly laid against my coun- 
tryrren — often offensively put, but yesterday put by the Hon. Mr. "Wood in 
his usually gentlemanly way. It is that of Canadian ' proclivity.' As a 
native-born Canadian, in common with others, T love the land of my birth. 
We adm.ire her institutions and revere her laws; but we never forget the 
land of our adoption, and we should no more consent to see her wronged by 
Canada than would the tens of thousands of Englishmen who have made 
Canada their home permit a wrong to be done her by England. * * * 
As to that ' other issue ' (meaning annexation), I have no fears for Canada, 
or this colony either. It used to be fashionable here in early days to asso- 
ciate the name of Canada with rebellion. It was the result of prejudice and 
ignorance and was a great mistake. * * * ^o sum up, sir, I say that 
amongst the statesmen of Canada we may safely look for men fully compe- 
tent to control the affairs of a young nation. They are men of as much am- 
bition and grasp of thought as are the rulers in the adjoining states; and 
depend upon it, nothing will be left undone to advance the prosperity and 
well-being of every portion of their vast Dominion. We may safely repose 
full confidence in them," 

Hon. Mr. Humphreys, for Lillooet, was somewhat fiery in his remarks, 
and thcugh in favor of Confederation was much " agin " the Government. 
He wanted to see responsible government made a sine qua non of Union. 

Hon, Mr, Carrall, another enthusiastic Confederationist, followed in a 
well-balanced speech, and coming from Cariboo, he had strong support in 
his constituents. Speaking of Canada, he said : " After she was prevented 
from going to the United States by that abrogation of the Reciprocity Treaty, 
she tun;ed her attention to her own resources, and I believe she is now going 
to be one of the most progressive nations upon the earth. Undoubtedly she 
is determined to progress westward until she reaches British Columbia and 



218 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the Pacific, and with all her progressive tendencies she will not abate one jot 
of her loyalty for which now. as ever, she is distinguished." 

Hon. Mr. Alston, Registrar-General, a representative of the official ele- 
ment in the House, supported the Government's resolution. Mr. Dewdney, 
the present Lieutenant-Governor, member for Kootenay, was in rather gn 
awkward position, for, as far as he could ascertain, his constituents were 
opposed to Confederation, but, as he was unable to consult with them upon 
the terms submitted, he took the responsibility of supporting the resolution 
for Confederation. He said that " in the light that it now bears, that I do 
believe that their opinions would be in unison with that of the country gen- 
erally — in favor of Confederation in terms now proposed." The debate was 
closed by brief remarks from Dr. Helrricken, defining his position, and the 
Honorable Attorney-General, Hon. Mr. Drake, member for Victoria City, 
withdrew his amendment, and the resolution was carried unanimously and 
the House went into committee of the whole. 

The discussion for the next ten days was on matters of detail and was 
quite too long and irregular to endeavor to present in any concise form. 
The terms as submitted by Governor Musgrave were agreed to, with a few 
exceptions, the principal of which were that the annual grant of $35,000 to 
be paid by the Dominion for the support of the local Government was raised 
to $75,000, and the limit of population at which the amount of subsidy be- 
came fixed was changed from 400,000 to 1,000,000, and a series of supple- 
mentary resolutions added. Messrs. Helmcken, Trutch and Carrall were 
chosen by the Executive to go to Ottawa to arrange the terms with the Do- 
minion Government. The sum of $3,000 was voted to defray their ex- 
penses, and they left on May 10, 1870, by way of San Francisco. On the 
7th of July the special correspondent of the " Colonist " telegraphed as fol- 
lows : " Terms agreed upon. The delegates are satisfied. Canada to Eng- 
land. Carrall remains one month. Helmcken and your correspondent are 
on their way home." 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 219 

The terms agreed upon have already been given in substance, and were 
confirmed by the Legislature upon its first meeting thereafter. 

The Terms of Union. 

In connection with the terms of Confederation submitted by Governor 
Musgrave and adopted in substance by the Legislative Council, supplementary 
resolutions, as has already been stated, were passed, stating: i. That 
duties levied upon maltsters and brewers, under the Excise Law of Canada, 
would be detrimental to British Columbia, and requesting that no export 
duty should be charged on spars exported from British Columbia. 2. That 
the application of the Canadian tariff, while reducing the aggregate burden 
of taxation, would injuriously afifect the agricultural and commercial interests 
of the community, and requesting that special rates of customs duties and 
regulations should be arranged for the colony. 3. That a geographical 
survey of British Columbia be made, such survey to be commenced one year 
after Confederation. 4. And that all public works and property as properly 
belonged to the Dominion under the British North America Act, should belong 
to British Columbia, and all roads to be free of toll of every kind whatsoever. 

The terms of union agreed upon between the delegates from British 
Columbia and the Government of Canada differed from those adopted by 
the Legislative Council in the following respects : That the population 
should be estimated at 60,000 instead of 120,000; that British Columbia should 
be entitled to six members in the House of Commons and three in the Senate, 
instead of eight members in the House of Commons and four in the Senate. 

The proposition for the construction of a wagon road from the main 
trunk road of British Columbia to Fort Garry was dropped, and the Do- 
minion undertook to secure the commencement simultaneously, within two 
years of the date of the union, of the construction of a railway from the 
Pacific to the Rocky Mountains, and from a selected place east of the Rocky 
Mountains to the Pacific, to connect the seaboard of British Columbia with 



220 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the railway system of Canada and to secure the completion of the railway 
within ten years from the date of union. For the construction of such rail- 
way the Government of British Columbia agreed to convey to the Dominion 
Government a land grant similar in extent through the entire length of 
British Columbia, not to exceed twenty miles on each side of the line, to that 
appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion Government from lands 
in the Northwest Territory and the Province of Manitoba, with this provision, 
however, that the land held under a pre-emption right or Crown grant within 
the forty-mile belt should be made good to the Dominion from contiguous 
public lands. In consideration of the lands to be thus conveyed to the rail- 
way to the Dominion Government agreed to pay to British Columbia from 
the date of union the sum of $100,000 per annum in half-yearly payments in 
advance. The charge of the Indians and the trusteeship and management 
of lands reserved for their use and benefit, were assumed by the Dominion 
Government. The constitution of the executive authority of the Legislature 
of British Columbia was to continue as existing at the time of union until 
altered under authority of the British North America Act, but it was under- 
stood that the Dominion Government would readily consent to the introduc- 
tion of responsible government when desired by British Columbia, and it 
was agreed by the Government of British Columbia tO' amend the constitu- 
tion so as to provide that the majority of the Legislative Council should be 
elective. 

An election was held in November of 1870, in which it is unnecessary 
to state that the terms of Confederation were the main issue. The new 
Council met January 5, 1871. Dr. Helmcken was nominated as Speaker, but 
declined. The terms of Confederation, as agreed upon, were passed unani- 
mously, and an address was presented to His Excellency the Governor, pray- 
ing that Her Majesty would be graciously pleased to admit British Columbia, 
under the provision of the British North America Act, into the Dominion 
of Canada. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 221 

Responsible government, for which the colony was fully prepared, was 
a natural consequence of Confederation, and a bill was introduced in the 
Council on the 31st of January, 1871, to give power to alter the constitution 
of British Columbia. The bill was considered in committee of the whole 
and reported complete, and was formally adopted on February 6. The first 
election under the new constitution took place in October, 1871. Hon. 
Joseph Trutch, conspicuous in bringing about Confederation, had been ap- 
pointed Lieutenant-Governor of the new province. Hon. J. F. (Justice) 
McCreight was called upon to form the first administration. There were 
twenty-five men elected to the first Legislature, as follows: George A. 
Walkem, Joseph Hunter, Cornelius Booth, John Ash, M. D., William Smithe, 
John P. Booth, A. Rocke Robertson, Henry Cogan, John A. Mara, Charles 
Todd, A. T. Jamieson, T. Humphreys, John Robson, Henry Holbrook, J. C. 
Hughes, W. J. Armstrong, J. F. McCreight, Simeon Duck, Robert Beaven, 
James Trimble, M. D., A. de Cosmos, A. Bunster, Robert Smith, James Rob- 
inson, Charles A. Semlin. Of that number of well known British Colum- 
bians, many of whom were or afterwards became prominent in public affairs, 
the following are still living: George A. Walkem, recently retired from the 
Supreme Court bench; Joseph Hunter, for many years Superintendent of 
the E. &amp; N. Railway; John A. Mara, ex-Speaker, and ex-member of the 
Dominion House of Commons; W. J. Armstrong, ex-sheriff of New West- 
minster; J. F. McCreight, retired from the Supreme Court bench; Robert 
Beaven, who for many years occupied a seat in the House, was Premier and 
several times Mayor of Victoria; W. F. Tolmie; and Charles A. Semlin, of 
Cache Creek, who was Premier succeeding Hon. J. H. Turner, and for many 
years a member of the Legislature. Seven of the number became Premiers 
of the province. 

it was not long before the question of the Canadian Pacific Railway 
began to give cause for trouble, which existed in a more or less aggravated 
form for seven or eight years. Few people, even in British Columbia, imag- 



222 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ined that the terms of union, so far as the railway was concerned, would be 
strictly adhered to, but of course they expected a bona fide attempt to com- 
mence and complete it within the time specified. Few people, either, prob- 
ably had considered fully the magnitude of the enterprise and the difficulties 
to be overcome. Sir Joseph Trutch, one of the delegates, was fully cognizant 
of the difficulties, however, when he made a speech at Ottawa in reply to 
the toast to his health at a banquet given in his honor before his visit to 
England. Speaking about the limit of time, he said : " If it had been put 
at twelve or fifteen years, British Columbia would have been just as well 
satisfied, and if the estimated period had been reduced to eight years it would 
not have been better pleased. But some definite period for the completion 
of this work the delegates from British Columbia insisted upon as a neces- 
sary safeguard to our colony in entering into the proposed union. To argue 
that any other interpretation will be placed upon this railway engagement by 
British Columbia than that which I have given to you as my construction of 
it, to argue that she expects that it will be carried out in the exact interpreta- 
tions of the words themselves, regardless of all circumstances, is a fallacy 
which cannot bear the test of common sense. I am sure you will find that 
British Columbia is a pretty intelligent community, which will be apt to take a 
business view of the matter. She will expect that this railway shall be com- 
menced in two years, for that is clearly practicable, and she will also expect 
that the financial ability of the Dominion will be exerted to its utmost, within 
the limit of reason, to complete it within the time named in the agreement. 
But you may rest assured that she will not regard this railway agreement as 
a ' cast iron contract,' as it has been called, or desire that it should be carried 
out in any other way than as will secure the prosperity of the whole Dominion, 
of which she is a part. I have understood this railway engagement in this 
way from the first, and still so understand it." 

This statement of Sir Joseph Trutch is most important to keep in mind. 
At a later date it was quoted in justification on the part of the Dominion 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 223 

Government for the delay in fulfilling the terms of union in regard to the 
building of a railway as agreed upon. In the next chapter the sequel to 
Confederation in the long and sore dispute over the construction of the Cana- 
dian Pacific Railway is dealt with at some length. Between that and the per- 
sonal reminiscences supplied by Mr. Higgins in a previous part of this his- 
tory, a very complete record is supplied of a memorable and crucial period in 
affairs of the province. 



224 BRITISH COLUMBIA 



CHAPTER X. 

BRITISH COLUMBIA AND THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY. 

1871-1881. 

On July 23rd, 1871, Governor Musgrave bade farewell to the province. 
His Excellency had been appointed for the special purpose of preparing the 
way for the entrance of British Columbia into the Canadian Confederation, 
and it must be admitted that he performed his delicate and difficult mission 
with diplomatic skill and ability. Thus another chapter in the history of the 
country was completed. 

The next great task to be performed, in" order to give full effect to the 
treaty just completed, was the construction of the railway which was the v-ery 
issue of the bond. Here we enter upon the consideration of a phase of pro- 
vincial history as important as any we shall probably ever have to deal with, 
and an endeavor will be made to set forth clearly the chief points in the long- 
standing and, at times, bitter dispute between the province and the Dominion 
of Canada which arose out of the efforts of the former to secure the fulfill- 
ment of the contract with respect to the promised communication by rail from 
east to west. If Confederation in British Columbia was difficult to bring 
about, the carrying out of the terms proved to be still more difficult and 
was productive of so much delay and irritation that at one time there threat- 
ened to be an abortive ending of the hopes of all those who had labored for 
the union. As the Imperial authorities had intervened to smooth the way 
for British Columbia entering the Dominion, so it was afterwards found ex- 
pedient that they should assist in smoothing her pathway in the Dominion. 
As all things end, so in this instance, there was an end to dispute and a happy 
consummation was reached in the commencement of the railway, which her- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 225 

aided the dawn of new hopes and foretold prosperity. The hatchet was 
buried, old fends were forgfotten and thereafter the province held loyally to 
Confederation. 

In committing itself to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway 
within ten years it is undoubtedly true that Canada had undertaken a task 
which seemed almost impossible of fulfillment, and little time had elapsed 
before it became apparent that the Dominion Government was not prepared 
to comply with the let+er of the compact. Sir John A. Macdonald. in his 
anxiety to bring about the union of the British North American possessions, 
had acceded to the wishes of the province, but in so doing had evidently 
underestimated the tremendous engineering difficulties which would have to 
be overcome before the road was an accomplished fact. Canada had entered 
into the agreement with entire sincerity, but also in ignorance of the char- 
acter of the country to be traversed by the railway. It is, therefore, not sur- 
prising that many and great delays occurred. British Columbia contended, 
and rightfully so, that the construction, or at least the commencement, of the 
railway within a reasonable period was of the gravest importance, and in- 
deed railway communication with the east had been practically the sole in- 
ducement that led the province to enter Confederation. Her public men, in 
common with the people of Eastern Canada, recognized that it would be im- 
possible to hold Canada responsible for the exact fulfillment of Section II of 
the Terms of Union. All that they desired was that an earnest should be 
given of the good faith of the Dominion in complying with its spirit. 

In June, 1873, an Order-in-Council was passed fixing Esquimalt on 
Vancouver Island as the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, 
and it further provided that a line of railway should be built between that 
point and Seymour Narrows. The order also recommended that British Co- 
lumbia should convey to the Dominion Government a strip of twenty miles 
in width on the east coast of Vancouver Island, along the proposed route of 
the railway. Much satisfaction was expressed by the people of the province 



226 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

at this evidence of the wilHngness of the Canadian Government to fulfill the 
Terms of Union. Two years, however, had elapsed and beyond the expendi- 
ture of some $400,000 in preliminary surveys, nothing had been done by 
Canada, and the people of British Columbia did not attempt to hide their 

disappointment. 

Mr. Edgar's Mission. 

In July, 1873, the Executive Council of the province, through the Lieu- 
tenant-Governor, Sir Joseph Trutch, entered a strong protest against further 
delay in the matter of the fulfillment of the Terms of Union, and it became 
apparent to the Dominion Government that no small amount of dissatisfaction 
existed in the western province. 

In September of this year Premier De Cosmos proceeded to Ottawa 
and afterwards to London as a special delegate from the Government of 
British Columbia to negotiate in connection with the construction of the 
graving dock at E^quimalt. He arranged that British Columbia should re- 
ceive $250,000 in lieu of a guarantee of interest on $500,000 for ten years 
after the construction of the dock. Mr. De Cosmos' report was laid on the 
table during the session of the following year, when another protest against 
delay was passed and forwarded to Ottawa. 

In the meanwhile the Government of Sir John A. Macdonald had be- 
come involved in the famous " Pacific Scandal." Sir John was forced to 
resign in November, 1873, and Mr, Alexander Mackenzie was called upon 
by the Earl of Dtifferin, then Governor-General of Canada, to form a Min- 
istry. On taking office he found himself heir to the problem of building a 
trans-continental railway, as provided in the treaty with British Columbia. 
At the inception of his management of affairs, he made, tactically at least, a 
very grave mistake by boldly outlining in a public speech at Sarnia the policy 
which he intended to pursue in that matter, and from his remarks on this 
occasion it was easy to infer that he deemed it impossible to carry out the 
Terms of Union in their entirety as they affected railway construction. In 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 227 

the meantime, public feeling in British Columbia was becoming roused and 
Mr. Mackenzie decided to despatch Mr. J. D. Edgar to the Pacific Coast to 
examine into and fully report upon the whole question. Mr. Edgar was 
empowered to make certain proposals to the provincial authorities with a 
view to an ultimate settlement of matters in dispute. He was also' instructed 
to point out that it was impossible to construct the road within the time speci- 
fied, and that any attempt to do so would only result in " very great useless 
expense and financial disorder " ; and to state that it was the intention of the 
Dominion to reach the seaboard of the Pacific only, not Esquimalt or 
Nanaimo. It was also to be intimated that " any further extension beyond 
the headwaters of Bute Inlet or whatever portion of the sea waters may be 
reached, may depend entirely on the spirit shown by themselves in consenting 
to a reasonable time or a modification of the terms originally agreed to." It 
must not be forgotten that the Dominion Government had gone beyond the 
Terms of Union in the matter of the graving dock at Elsquimalt, and had 
also agreed to advance in cash the balance of the amount of debt with which 
the province had entered Confederation. The Dominion, therefore, not un- 
reasonably perhaps, expected that British Columbia would be actuated by a 
similar tolerant spirit. But the Federal Ministry apparently entirely failed 
to comprehend the intense feeling on the subject in the province where the 
railway was considered, as indeed it was, of vital importance. With regard 
to the proposals which Mr. Edgar had been empowered to make in behalf of 
the Canadian Government to the provincial authorities, it may be added that 
they were briefly as follows: The Dominion Government would undertake 
the commencement of a railway on Vancouver Island, traversing northward 
to the point of crossing; to provide for the diligrnt prosecution of surveys 
on the Mainland ; and that as soon as the railway could be placed under con- 
struction no less than $1,500,000 would be spent annually. 

Mr. Edgar reached Victoria in May, 1874, and immediately entered into 
communication with the Honorable George A. Walkem, then Attorney-Gen- 



228 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

eral. He endeavored, in addition to the work involved by tedious negotia- 
tions, to ascertain the popular view on the railway question by traveling and 
mingling with the people on the Mainland. Unfortunately, the representa- 
tive of the Dominion, though an able and conscientious man, accomplished 
nothing, and it is quite clear from his method of procedure that diplomacy 
was not his forte. After the negotiations had been continued for some time, 
the local Government, through Mr. Walkem, informed Mr. Edgar that they 
were not satisfied as to his status, and desired the authorities at Ottawa to 
state whether their representative was clothed with full power to negotiate, 
and whether proposals made by him would be considered as binding by the 
Government of Canada. Mr. Mackenzie intimated in reply that the position 
of Mr. Edgar had been plainly indicated. The latter, however, was imme- 
diately recalled, his mission, if anything, having rather increased than less- 
ened the difficulties of the situation. The failure of Mr. Edgar to procure 
an amicable settlement only tended to increase the friction between the two 
Governments, which now assumed threatening proportions. A profound 
anxiety was expressed by Mr. Walkem and his colleagues regarding the in- 
tentions of the Canadian Ministiy, and the dilatory action of the Dominion 
was viewed with alarm and disappointment. The Ottawa authorities were 
anxious that a change should be made in the railway terms, and contended 
that they could not be called upon to carry out the original provisions, in 
view of the fact that the route of the railway had not yet been determined, 
although every effort had been made to settle this all-important point. The 
Provincial Government, on the other hand, while evincing no desire to hold 
Canada, in face of the opposition of the majority of its people, responsible for 
the carrying out of these terms to the letter, did not hesitate to demand that 
the Ministry should give a definite assurance with regard to the commence- 
ment of construction and the completion of this great work. 

Mr. Mackenzie's opinion of the promise of the Dominion Government 
to construct the Canadian Pacific Railway is clearly shown in the following 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 229 

excerpt from his letter of instructions to Mr. Edg-ar : " Yoti will also put 
them in remembrance of the terms they themselves proposed, which terms 
were assented to by their local Legislature, and point out that it was only 
the insane act of the administration here which gave such conditions of 
union to Columbia; that it could only have been because that administration 
sought additional means of procuring extensive patronage immediately be- 
fore the general election, and saw in coming contests the means of carrying 
the elections, that the province obtained on paper terms which at the time 
were known to be impossible of fulfillment.'' He was evidently appalled by 
the immensity of the undertaking, and tO' his cautious mind it meant financial 
disaster to the Dominion. Though great in rectitude, Mackenzie did not 
possess the wider vision or inspiring imagination of his predecessor; nor did 
he realize the resources and possibilities of the far west. There were indeed 
few Canadians at the time who' did. 

The Great Dispute. 

Mr. Mackenzie, in view of what appeared to him to be insuperable diffi- 
culties, on several occasions endeavored to obtain the consent of the Provincial 
Government to a modification of the terms. The province, however, was 
strenuously opposed to his proposals. Their mere suggestion aroused intense 
feeling, and although the Dominion Government averred that it was their 
intention to push forward the work of construction with all possible despatch, 
and that they had not the slightest desire to repudiate their obligations to 
the province, such assurances were received with no little distrust. Indeed, 
feeling became so strong in Victoria that a public meeting was called in Feb- 
ruary, 1874, to protest against the Government of Mr. De Cosmos assenting 
to any modification of the railway terms. The terms of the resolutions passed 
and the sequel, as it affected the local legislature, are given in the previous 
chapter by Mr. Higgins. 

As previously mentioned, it had been provided by an Order-in-Council, 



230 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

passed in June, 1873, that Esquimalt should be the terminus of the Canadian 
Pacific Railway, and -in order to make this possible it was decided that the 
line should be carried across Seymour Narrows. This decision, in the light 
of later events, proved, to say the least, premature. The residents of Van- 
couver Island, who at first were naturally elated at the determination of the 
Dominioq, evinced the greatest hostility to a change of route, even when 
the enormous cost and the difficulty of bridging the Narrows eventually 
proved that the scheme was, for the time being, impracticable. The selec- 
tion of a terminus proved a fruitful source of friction between the two Gov- 
ernments. The British Columbia administration strenuously endeavored to 
secure the construction of the Island Railway as a portion of the main line, 
as indeed, from the tenor of certain despatches, had evidently been the orig- 
inal intention of Sir John A. Macdonald. At a later date, however, the Do- 
minion Government asserted that the construction of a line of railway on 
Vancouver Island was intended only as a local work, which it was proposed 
should in some measure indemnify the province for the loss sustained by the 
non-fulfillment of the Terms of Union. Mr. Walkem on the part of the 
province combated with much acumen and force any such interpretation of 
the action of the Federal Government. However, as will be shown later, it 
was at last settled by mutual consent that the terminus should be on Burrard 
Inlet. Throughout the whole discussion the city of Victoria, for obvious 
reasons, had endeavored in every possible way to secure the location of the 
terminus at Esquimalt, and was opposed to any modification of the terms 
that would interfere with the fulfillment of the cherished desire of its citizens. 
While the Island, through " The Terms of Union Preservation League," 
strenuously opposed the alteration or modification of the terms and condi- 
tions upon which the province had entered Confederation, the Mainland was 
not at all unanimous on the question. In fact, a numerously signed petition 
was forwarded to his Excellency the Governor-General in the summer of 
1874 by the residents of the latter portion of the Province, which stated that 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 231 

in their opinion " the Order of the Privy Council of Canada, of June 7th, 
1873, is in no way binding on Your Excellency's present Government and 
that a line of railway along" the seaboard of Vancouver Island to Esquimalt 
is no part of the Terms of Union." The document in question then re- 
cited " that in any arrang-ement which may be entered into for an extension 
of time for the commencement or completion of the railway, any considera- 
tion granted by the Dominion Government to the Province of British Colum- 
bia, should be such as would be generally advantageous to the whole Prov- 
ince, and not of merely a local nature, benefiting only a section thereof." 
The petitioners also added that in their opinion it would be " unwise, im- 
politic, and unjust to select any line for the railway until time be given for 
a thorough survey of the different routes on the Mainland," as it was be- 
lieved that such surveys would result " in the selection of the Eraser Valley 
route, which is the only one that connects the fertile districts of the interior 
with the seaboard." It will thus be seen that sectional feeling had been 
aroused, which unfortunately continued to exist long after its direct cause 
had been removed. 

In order to arrive at an impartial conclusion respecting the situation as 
it actually existed, it is necessary to examine the conditions, circumstances 
arid state of public feeling at the time, both in British Columbia and in 
Eastern Canada. When the people of the Province entered Confederation, 
expectations were high and anticipations eager and sanguine. The change 
betokened to them an era of development and prosperity, such as they had 
not experienced since the early gold mining days. Buoyed up with such 
hopes they did not realize the difficulties imposed on the Government of 
Canada and the attitude towards the building of a trans-continental line 
of railway, in the circumstances and for the objects to be gained, assumed 
by the great majority of the people of older Canada. As time passed and 
their expectations were not realized, distrust and disappointment succeeded 
hope. 



232 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Day by day it became more evident that the Dominion Government 
were loath to carry out the obHgations assumed in behalf of British Colum- 
bia, and a bitterness of feeling developed that boded no good for the future 
of the relations between the West and the East. Isolated as the Province 
was, with declining trade, and mining, except in fitful bursts of excitement 
as new finds were made, stagnant, it is not difficult to understand that its 
people regarded the failure to proceed with construction of the railway as 
an absolute and unjustifiable breach of faith and the violation of the terms 
of a solemn treaty. On the other hand, the people of Eastern Canada, with- 
out knowledge of the country and not realizing what the West had in store 
for them, looked askance at the proposition and honestly believed that Sir 
John Macdonald had bartered natural solvency in a bargain that had little else 
than sentimental considerations to jusify it. In those days Canada was in 
an experimental stage as a Confederacy and the task of bridging a continent 
by a line of railway, which today is undertaken without fear, seemed beyond 
the limits of practicability — a hair-brained scheme. There were men of 
inij gir-ation, enthusiasts, who, fired with zeal by an undertaking so pregnant 
with possibilities for the Dominion and who, bounding over physical ob^ 
stacles and eliminating time and distance, reached what we have already 
realized; but they were here and there. Alexander Mackenzie did not be- 
long to that class of statesmen; he had been moulded in the school of hard 
facts, and rocks and mountains and long distances were verities to him not 
to be overcome by any effort of the imagination. He was as prosaic as he 
was honest, and was deeply imbued with the idea that the construction of this 
enormous work was impossible unless it should be spread over a number of 
years. He did not hesitate to affirm that it was a physical impossibility to 
build the railway in accordance with the terms agreed upon, and that any 
attempt to do so could only result in grave financial peril. Mackenzie rep- 
resented the conservative element, who looked askance at big things without 
the money in hand to see them through. As between British Columbia and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 233 

Eastern Canada neither one could put itself in the mental attitude of the 
other, and so the breach grew wider. With the people of the former the 
building of a railway was the one object of their living, the sunimmn bonum 
of their hopes, their financial salvation. The Dominion made overtures, 
and offered certain concessions in order that the Province might be com- 
pensated for the loss it had suffered through the inability of Canada to 
fulfill what were treaty obligations. These overtures, however, were re- 
jected by the Provincial administration as it was feared that their accept- 
ance would jeopardize the right of the Province to demand the immediate 
commencement of the more important work on the Mainland. The Do- 
minion would not accede to the Provincial demands and a dead-lock con- 
sequently ensued. The discontent at last became so great that the admin- 
istration determined to dispatch a petition to Her Majesty, the Queen. , A 
memorial was therefore drawn up, complaining of the non-fulfillment of 
the Terms of Union on the part of the Dominion Government, and setting 
forth clearly and concisely the grievances of the Province, and the hard- 
ships that it had endured on account of the dilatoriness of the authorities at 
Ottawa. The petition concluded with the following paragraphs : 

" That British Columbia has fulfilled all the conditions of her agree- 
ment tmder the Terms of Union : 

" That the Dominion has not completed the necessary railway explora- 
tions and surveys; nor since 1872 has any effort, at all adequate to the un- 
dertaking, been made up to the present time : 

" That notwithstanding the fact on the seventh day of June, 1873, by 
Order of the Privy Council ' Esquimalt' was' ' fixed' as the point of com- 
mencement on the Pacific, and it was decided that a line should ' be located 
between that harbor and Seymour Narrows;' and notwithstanding, further, 
that a valuable belt of land, along the line indicated, has ever since been 
reserved by British Columbia, at the instance of the Dominion, and for tho 



234 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

purposes, ostensibly, of immediate construction, the Dominion Government 
have failed and neglected to commence construction up to the present time: 

" That although the Government of the Dominion admit that the agree- 
ment v^ith British Columbia has been violated, and acknowledged that im- 
mediate construction might be commenced at Esquimalt, and active work 
vigorously prosecuted upon * that portion of the railway ' between Esqui- 
malt and Nanaimo, yet they virtually refuse to commence such construction 
unless British Columbia consents to materially change the Railway Clause 
of the Treaty : 

" That, in consequence of the course pursued by the Dominion, Brit- 
ish Columbia is suffering great loss; her trade has been damaged and un- 
settled; her general prosperity has become seriously affected; her people 
have become discontented; a feeling of depression has taken the place of the 
confident anticipations of commercial and political advantages to be derived 
from the speedy construction of a great railway, uniting the Atlantic and 
Pacific shores of Your Majesty's Dominion on the Continent of North 

America." 

The Carnarvon Terms. 

It was furthermore decided that the Honorable George A. Walkem, 
Attorney General, who, by the way, had always displayed the utmost dili- 
gence in pressing upon the Dominion the necessity of complying with the 
Terms of Union, should proceed immediately to Ottawa and from thence 
to London to press the claims of the Province. The petition to Her Majesty 
was in due course forwarded to the Earl of Carnarvon, Secretary of State 
for the Colonies, who was also informed of Mr. Walkem's departure for 
England. Earl Carnarvon in a dispatch (June i8th, 1874) to His Ex- 
cellency the Governor General, intimated that although he had no desire to 
interfere in the affairs of Canada he would gladly waive all considerations 
of delicacy, as he was strongly impressed with the great importance of 
effecting a speedy and amicable settlement of the matters in dispute between 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 235 

the Provincial and Dominion Governments. He, therefore, signified his 
willingness to tender his good offices as arbitrator, provided that all con- 
cerned were agreeable to the proposal and that his decision should be ac- 
cepted as final. Each party was requested to furnish a statement, and on 
these written reports a decision would be rendered. Both the Dominion 
and Provincial administrations accepted Earl Carnarvon's generous offer 
and also agreed to be bound by his decision. Thus it seemed that the un- 
happy controversy which had been carried on with more or less bitterness by 
both sides, was in a fair way to be settled in a friendly manner. 

The Dominion Government in a report of the Privy Council dated July 
8th, 1874, replied at some length to the charges preferred by British Colum- 
bia. It was carefully pointed out, and much was made of the fact, that the 
passage of the section in the Terms of Union relating to the construction of 
the Pacific Railway had been strongly opposed in Parliament, and was only 
carried by a small majority of ten. It was also claimed that even to obtain 
this majority the Government of the day had been obliged to propose a 
resolution that distinctly laid down that the railway should be " constructed 
and worked by private enterprise, and not by the Dominion Government, and 
that the public aid given to secure that undertaking should consist of such 
liberal grants of land, and such subsidy in money or other aid, not increas- 
ing the present rate of taxation, as the Parliament of Canada shall hereafter 
determine." 

Mr. Joseph Trutch, the Provincial delegate, who had been at Ottawa 
when the Terms were discussed, had, as already stated, intimated at a public 
meeting that the Province did not regard the Terms of Union as to a railway 
binding to the letter, but all that was required was that the railway should 
be built as soon and with as little delay as possible. The Federal Ministry 
contended that such statements showed very clearly that the " Terms were 
directory rather than mandatory." Furthermore it was pointed out that 
over one million dollars had been voted for surveys, more than one-half of 



236 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

which had been spent in British Columbia. In spite of strenuous exertions, 
however, the engineers had not been able to locate any portion of the line, 
and, therefore, it had been impossible to vigorously prosecute the work of 
construction. 

It was also mentioned that in March, 1873, Sir Hugh Allan had formed 
a company which had undertaken to complete the line for a grant of $30,- 
ooo,cxx) and 20,000 acres of land per mile. Sir Hugh journeyed to London, 
where he endeavored to obtain financial assistance, but his efforts resulted 
in failure and in consequence the company relinquished their charter. 

The Dominion also referred to the fact, that in their solicitude for 
the welfare of the Province, Mr, Edgar had been dispatched on a special 
mission to the Government of British Columbia, and although Mr. Edgar 
had been empowered to make certain proposals regarding an amelioration 
of the railway conditions, the Executive Council of the Province refused to 
enter into negotiations with him on the ground that he was not a duly ac- 
credited agent. The Dominion Government stigmatized the action of Brit- 
ish Columbia in this connection as a " mere technical pretense." Again it 
was contended that the public feeling of the whole Dominion was so strong- 
ly against " the fatal extravagance involved in the terms agreed to by the 
late Government, that no Government could live that would attempt or 
rather pretend to attempt their literal fulfillment." It was averred that 
public meetings had been held both on Vancouver Island and the Mainland 
which had condemned the action of the Provincial Executive in not acceding 
to the proposed modifications. The report concludes with a reference to 
the action of the Government respecting the Graving Dock at Esquimalt 
which, it is argued, clearly demonstrates that the Canadian Ministry had 
always exhibited a profound desire to act in accordance with the Terms of 
Union, and even to go beyond them when circumstances warranted such 
behavior. Under the Terms of Union the Dominion was bound to guar- 
antee five per cent on $500,000 for ten years after the construction of the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 237 

dock. The Local Government, however, on finding that it was impossible 
to have the- work performed on the basis of this subsidy, solicited further 
aid from Ottawa and in order to comply with this request the Dominion 
Government obtained authority from Parliament to advance the sum of 
$250,000 as the work progressed. 

Mr. Mackenzie certainly nrepared a careful and plausible statement of 
the case from the Dominion standpoint. Briefly, he contended that, al- 
though it had been ascertained that the literal fulfillment of the Terms of 
Union was impossible, Canada had always conscientiously endeavored to 
keep faith with British Columbia, and that in face of tremendous difficulties 
the work of mapping out the route of the Pacific Railway had been prosecuted 
with all diligence, and, further, that no expense had been spared that was 
compatible with the means at the disposal of the Government. 

Upon arriving in London Mr. Walkem immediately proceeded to lay 
before the Earl of Carnarvon the case for British Columbia. The main 
points of the controversy were fully discussed and the Secretary of State for 
the Colonies expressed satisfaction at the moderate statement made on be- 
half of the Province. Mr. Walkem's tact and knowledge certainly cleared 
the way for a prompt solution of the problem. The Dominion Government 
presented their side of the case in a Minute of Council, dealing at length 
with the whole question. 

After a delay of a few weeks, during which period both parties to the 
dispute laid counter statements before the Earl of Carnarvon, a decision was 
rendered which was embodied in a dispatch to the Earl of Dufferin, then 
Governor General. After expressing satisfaction at the clear and complete 
statements furnished by the Dominion and Provincial Governments, and at 
the temperate and forbearing manner in which both sides of the case had 
been presented, the Secretary of State remarked that any decision he might 
render must of necessity partake of the nature of a compromise, and as such 
it was not improbable that he might fall short of giving complete satisfac- 



238 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

tipn to either side. It was also pointed out that under the amended terms 
British Columbia would, after all, receive substantial advantages from the 
union with Canada, while on the other hand, the Dominion would be de- 
livered of no inconsiderable part of those obligations which had been all too 
hastily assumed in the first instance, without sufficient knowledge of the con- 
ditions under which so great and important a work could be carried into 
effect. Briefly the remarks of the Earl of Carnarvon, in handing down his 
decision, were as follows: 

1. That the railway from Esquimalt to Nanaimo shall be commenced 
as soon as possible, and completed with all practicable despatch. 

2. That the surveys on the Mainland shall be pushed on with the ut- 
most vigor. On this point, after considering the representations of your, 
ministers, I feel that I have no alternative but tO' reply, as I do most fully 
and readily, upon their assurance that no legitimate effort or expense will 
be spared, first, to determine the best route for the line, and secondly, to 
proceed with the details of the engineering work. It would be distasteful 
to me, if, indeed, it were not impossible, to prescribe strictly any minimum of 
time or expenditure with regard to work of so uncertain a nature; but, hap- 
pily, it is equally impossible for me to doubt that your Government will 
loyally do its best in every way to accelerate the completion of a duty left 
freely to its sense of honor and justice. 

3. That the wagon road and telegraph line shall be immediately con- 
structed. There seems here to be some difference of opinion as to the special 
value to the Province of the undertaking to complete these two works, but 
after considering what has been said, I am of opinion that they should both 
be proceeded with at once, as indeed is suggested by your ministers. 

4. That $2,000,000 a year, and not $1,500,000, shall be the minimum 
expenditure on railway works within the Province from the date at which 
the surveys are sufficiently completed to enable that amount to be expended 
on construction. In naming this amount I understand that it being alike the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 239 

interest and the wish of the Dominion Government to urge on with all speed 
the completion of the works now to be undertaken, the annual expenditure 
will be as much in excess of the minimum, of $2,000,000 as in any year may 
be found practicable. 

5. Lastly, that on or before December 31st, 1898, the railway shall be 
completed and open for traffic from the Pacific seaboard to a point at the 
western end of Lake Superior, at which it will fall into connection with the 
existing lines of railway through a portion of the United States, and also 
with the navigation of Canadian waters. To proceed at present with the 
remainder of the railway extending, by the country northward of Lake 
Superior, to the existing Canadian lines, ought not, in my opinion, to be re- 
quired, and the time for undertaking that work must be determined by the 
development of settlement and the changing circumstances of the country. 
The day is, however, I hope, not very distant when a continuous line of 
railway through Canadian territory will be practicable, and I therefore look 
upon this portion of the scheme as postponed rather than abandoned. 

The decision gave satisfaction not only to the Province but also to the 
Dominion, in fact, the latter maintained in a report of the Privy Council, 
accepting the new terms, and approved by the Governor General on Decem- 
ber i8th, 1874, that " the conclusion at which His Lordship has arrived 
* upholds,' as he remarks, in the main, and subject only to some modifica- 
tion of detail, the policy adopted by this Government on this most embarrass- 
ing question." 

It was now hoped that the " Carnarvon Terms," a name by which the 
agreement in question was familiarly known, would once for all settle the 
problem of railway construction, and great was the rejoicing in British 
Columbia thereat. Once again the people were doomed to disappointment. 

Further Delays. 

Two years went by and the construction of the railway had not been 
commenced in the Province, although a certain amount of preliminary work 



240 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

had been accomplished. The Government of British Columbia repeatedly 
demanded that the Dominion should give effect to the " Carnarvon Terms," 
but without avail. Matters went from bad to worse and discontent became 
so general in the Province that secession was openly talked of. 

In January, 1876, the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia once 
again resorted to the expedient of petitioning Her Majesty to compel the 
Canadian Government to redress the grievances of the Province. The peti- 
tion cited the fact that although the Dominion Government had distinctly 
consented to be bound by the decision of the E^rl of Carnarvon in 1874. no 
real attempt had been made to carry out the solemn obligations imposed by 
that agreement; that the action of the Dominion Government in refusing 
to make an annual railway expenditure of two million dollars in the Province. 
in spite of the agreement to do so, if the performance of this promise should 
interfere with the conditions of a resolution passed in the House of Com- 
mons in 1 87 1, after the Terms of Union had been assented to, created great 
dissatisfaction; that in effect the resolution in question provided that the 
railway should be constructed and worked by private enterprise, and not 
by the Governm.ent, and that subsidies in land and money, to an extent that 
would not increase the existing rate of taxation, should be given in aid of 
the work; that the terms of this resolution were abandoned in 1874, the 
rate of taxation having been increased and the work undertaken by the 
Dominion instead of being confined to private enterprise, in accordance with 
the expressed demand of Parliament; that the residents of Vancouver Island 
still held fast to the hope thit Sir John A. Macdonald's assurance would be 
adhered to, that a section of the main line would run from Nanaimo to 
Esquimau, was clearly indicated by a passage in the petition to the effect 
that no compensation had been offered by the Dominion Government for the 
abandonment of this portion of the railway. After adverting to various 
other matters wherein the Canadian Government had failed to fulfill its 
promises, it was urged that the Province had entered confederation upon

the distinct and specific agreement that as " no real union could exist " 
without " speedy communication " between " British Columbia and the east- 
ern provinces through British territory, it was necessary that the Canadian 
Pacific Railway should be built by the Dominion as a work of political and 
commercial necessity." 

British Columbia, it was pointed out, had conscientiously fulfilled all 
the conditions of her agreement with Canada. The last section but one of 
the petition eloquently stated "that by reason of the repeated violations by 
Canada of its railway engagements with this Province, all classes of our 
population have suffered loss; confident anticipations based on these engage- 
ments have resulted in unexepected and undeserved failure, and in disap- 
pointment of a grave and damaging character; distrust has been created 
where trust and confidence should have been inspired; trade and commerce 
have been mischievously unsettled and disturbed; the progress of the Prov- 
ince has been seriously checked, and a feeling of depression has taken the 
place of the confident anticipations of commercial and political advantage 
to be derived from the speedy construction of a railway which should prac- 
tically unite the Atlantic and Pacific shores of Your Majesty's Dominion on 
the continent of North America." 

In answer to this indictment the Privy Council of Canada prepared a 
long report, contending that from the first the Government of the Dominion 
had been animated by a desire to honorably fulfill the engagements to which 
the country had been committed. The Imperial Authorities were asked to 
believe that British Columbia, ignoring the general welfare of the country, 
of which it had become an integral portion in 1871, and actuated by purely 
selfish motives, urgently pressed for an enormous annual expenditure in 
order that the small population dwelling in the West might reap vast profits. 
It was maintained that the behavior of the Province could hardly be cal- 
culated to induce people of Canada to " second the efforts of the administra- 
tion to redeem, as far as they can, the appalling obligations to which, by the 



242 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Terms of Union, the country was committed." The Government repeated 
their assertion that they would endeavor to construct the Canadian Pacific 
Railway as rapidly as the resources of the country would permit. 

Lord Dup^ferin^s Visit. 

The Earl of Dufferin, who later achieved fame and success as a dip- 
lomatist and ambassador in Russia and France and as Viceroy of India, had 
from his inception of office displayed the greatest interest in the unfortunate 
dispute between his ministers and the youngest member of the Canadian 
family. He fully realized the difficulties that beset the path of the admin- 
istration with regard to its railway policy as it affected the West, and de- 
sired to prevent, if possible, the disruption of the Dominion. This far- 
seeing statesman clearly understood that Canada's future welfare depended 
to a great extent on her trade relations with the Pacific. He intelligently 
studied the whole question and came to the conclusion that at all hazards 
British Columbia must form a part of the Dominion, in order that the Brit- 
ish possessions in North America might become a great, powerful and united 
country, reaching from sea to sea. He perceived that an all-rail connection 
with the Pacific Coast would in the future open rich avenues of trade with 
the Far East. Canada would be able to exchange the products of her for- 
ests, mines and farms for the spices, silks and tea of the Orient. The 
newest portion of the New World would enter into communication with a 
civilization rivalling Greece and Egypt in antiquity — the Far East and the 
Far West would join hands across the sea. Bearing this in mind he de- 
cided to visit the Province with the intention of using his influence with the 
Provincial administration to bring about an amicable settlement of the mat- 
ters in dispute. He left Ottawa in 1876 and arrived at Victoria after a 
pleasant journey across the continent. 

During his brief sojourn at Victoria His Excellency took no little 
trouble to ascertain public opinion concerning the all-important railway 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 248 

question. He mingled freely with the people, received deputations and a 
a number of petitions, and endeavored to become familiar with the question 
from a Provincial standpoint. While he frankly admitted that he had not 
come on a diplomatic mission for the purpose of removing obstacles, he 
stated that he was particularly anxious to establish a better understanding 
between the two Governments by pointing out some of the difficulties it 
would be necessary to overcome before the road could be built. He was 
fully aware of the gravity of the charge that Canada had broken her solemn 
pledges regarding the construction of a trans-continental line, made at the 
time when British Columbia entered confederation. His Excellency also 
fully appreciated the disappointment of the Province at the non-fulfillment 
of the Terms of Union, which as he stated had the force of an international 
treaty; yet, he contended that the tremendous difificulties in the way of com- 
pleting the line within the stipulated time had not been fully realized, either 
by the Provincial or Dominion authorities. In passing we must not forget 
to refer to the memorable speech delivered at Government House, Victoria, 
in which he ably and eloquently outlined the history of the whole affair. 
This speech has always been reckoned as a masterpiece of oratory. It was 
a statesmanlike utterance and the points in dispute were handled so carefully 
that little offense was given. In expressing sympathy with the Province, 
he was extremely careful to refrain from making statements which might 
reflect upon the integrity of his ministers. In fact, he rather sought to re- 
lieve the Government of Canada from the charge of negligence and lack of 
interest, by dwelling at considerable length on the engineering difficulties 
of the route of the railway. He referred to the fact that although survey 
parties had been in the field for several years it had been impossible, upon 
the data acquired, to decide as to the best course for the line. The difficulty 
of locating a feasible pass through the Rocky Mountains was also mentioned. 
Although openly avowing that he had no right to speak for the Canadian 
Ministry, he did not hesitate to take up the cudgels in behalf of Sir Alexan- 



244 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

der Mackenzie, and he particularly disclaimed that there was the least de- 
sire to break faith with the Province. In discussing the question, remem- 
bering perhaps that his hearers were residents of Vancouver Island, he did 
not forget to state that he was under the impression that if Bute Inlet was 
selected as the Mainland terminus of the railway it would not be possible 
for it to stop there. The railway, he said, must under these circumstances 
be prolonged to Esquimalt. 

Of course it was well known that the inhabitants of Vancouver Island, 
for obvious reasons, were particularly anxious to have Esquimalt made the " 
terminus. From the earliest years the voice of the Island had been supreme 
in the Councils of the Province, owing to its population and political in- 
fluence being far greater than that of the Mainland. It was openly stated 
by leaders of public opinion on the Island that unless the decision of Sir John 
A. Macdonald to make Esquimalt the terminus should be adhered to, they 
would take British Columbia out of confederation. It is certainly true that 
the Governor General lessened to a great extent the irritation caused by the 
action .of the Dominion, and his explanation did no little to allay sectional 
feeling which unfortunately had already tinged with bitterness the relations 
of the Island and Mainland portions of the Province. 

It is not necessary to follow further the ramifications of the dispute be- 
tween the two Governments. Let it suffice that after much correspondence, 
and statements and counter-statements, in 1878, the problem was scarcely 
nearer solution than it had been in 1874, when the Earl of Carnarvon ac- 
cepted the responsibility of arbitrating in the matter. In 1878, a general 
election took place and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's Government was hope- 
lessly defeated at the polls. 

Sir John Macdonald evinced a strong desire to accede to the wishes of 
British Columbia with regard to railway construction. With an insight 
eminently characteristic of the man, he recognized that not only was it neces- 
sary to build the Canadian Pacific Railway in order to keep faith with the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 245 

western Province, but that this Hne was also greatly needed to open up for 
settlement the vast extent of agricultural lands in Manitoba and the North- 
west Territories. The settlement of these lands would ensure a large grow- 
ing market to the eastern manufacturers, who, since the repeal of the 
Reciprocity Treaty with the United States, had been obliged to seek new 
fields for the disposal of their wares. 

Surveys and Construction. 

In the meantime, Sir Sandford Fleming, with an able staff of assistant 
engineers, had been diligently prosecuting exploratory surveys along the dif- 
ferent routes which, from time to time, had been advocated for the line. 
In 1879, it was at last definitely decided that the route of the Pacific Railway 
through British G&gt;lumbia should terminate at a point on or near Burrard In- 
let. In January, 1880, British Columbia was requested by the Imperial au- 
thorities to convey, without unnecessary delay to the Dominion Government 
the lands for twenty miles on each side of the railway Hne, in accordance 
with the eleventh section of the Terms of Union. Towards the end of De- 
cember, 1880, the Honorable Mr. Walkem left for Ottawa in order to make 
final arrangements with regard to the commencement of construction in the 
Province, and to press upon the Government the loss and injury which would 
be inflicted upon the Southern portion of British Columbia by further de- 
laying the construction of the Esquimalt-Nanaimo section. Mr. Walkem 
pointed out that the Dominion Government had offered in 1874 to construct 
the work as a " portion of the railway " and furthermore that a solemn en- 
gagement had been entered into with England and the Province in 1875 
to commence it " as soon as possible " and complete it with " all possible 
despatch." In reply the Prime Minister remarked that the whole subject 
had been carefully considered and that the contracts for the mainland work 
had been let. He also intimated that the Government were of the opinion 
that it was impossible to do more at present. It thus appeared that at last 



246 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the controversy with regard to the Canadian Pacific Railway, which had 
been carried on for nearly nine years with great bitterness on both sides, was 
in a fair way to be settled. 

Mr. Onderdonk, the well known financier of San Francisco, secured 
the contract for building the first one hundred and twenty-eight miles of line 
on the mainland, from Emory's Bar to Savona. The contract was divided 
as follows : 

Sub-section A, Emory's Bar to Boston Bar, 29 miles; to be 

completed December ist, 1883 $2,727,300.00 

Sub-section B, Boston Bar to Lytton, 29^ miles; to be com- 
pleted June 30th, 1884 2,573,640.00 

Sub-section C, Lytton to Junction Flat, 29 miles; to be com- 
pleted December 31st, 1884. 2,056,950.00 

Sub-section D, Junction Flat to Savona, 403^ miles, to be 

completed June 30th, 1885 . 1,809,150.00 

$9,167,040.00 

The Terms of Union provided that the railway should be commenced^ 
simultaneously from each end within two years of the ratification of the 
agreement. So far as the Eastern section of the line was concerned, it was 
a comparatively easy matter to select a suitable route. Neither Ontario nor 
the prairies westward of that Province contained any very serious obstacles 
from an engineering standpoint. It was only when the huge chain of 
Rockies was reached that the difficulties really commenced, and the magni- 
tude of the work involved in crossing the " sea of mountains " to the Pacific 
became fully apparent. At first sight it appeared that it would be impos- 
sible to find a practicable route through this tremendous barrier. 

The engineers and explorers who were dispatched to ascertain the most 
feasible route across Canada had little trouble until they arrived at the foot- 
hills of the Rockies. From this time on, however, a divergence of opinion 
existed as to the most likely pass through the mountains. As early as 1793 
Sir Alexander Mackenzie, then Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 247 

had discovered the Peace River, and traced it to its source. Time and space 
forbid an account of this heroic journey across a country that was then, and 
is now, comparatively an unknown land. In 1828, Sir George Simpson, also 
a Governor of the Company of Adventurers Trading into Hudson's Bay, in 
a remarkable journey explored a considerable portion of the Peace River, 
and finally reached the Pacific Coast. To these illustrious travelers we are 
indebted for our first knowledge of this grand river and the country through 
which it flows. Still, as can readily be imagined, the data acquired by Sir 
Alexander Mackenzie and Sir George Simpson were altogether insufficient 
for the purpose of basing a decision as to the desirability of the country for 
settlement and railway construction. Eventually three passes were explored 
— the Peace River Pass, Yellowhead Pass and Pine River Pass — with the 
result that it was proved in many ways the Yellowhead was the most prac- 
ticable opening in the mountains by which to reach British Columbia. To 
the untoward delays that occurred in deciding upon the merits of the various 
passes, the discontent that existed in British Columbia was mainly due. Sir 
Sandford Fleming early in the day recognized the Yellowhead Pass as an 
important objective point aff^ording an easy entrance to British Columbia 
through mountains which heretofore had been pronounced impenetrable. 
Although he had come to this conclusion in 1872 he did not deem it advis- 
able to commence construction without first carefully examining the passes 
to the northward. In addition to the difficulty of selecting a pass through 
the mountains, a difficulty almost as great was encountered in choosing the 
western terminal point. Opinion differed vastly with regard to the harbor 
offering the best facilities as a terminus for a trans-continental line. Wad- 
dington Harbor, on Bute Inlet, Port Simpson, Port Essington and Port 
Moody, on Burrard Inlet, all had their supporters, and as previously men- 
tioned, the residents of Vancouver Island claimed that Esquimalt was the 
most convenient place. In 1887, Mr. Cambie followed the Skeena River 
from its mouth to the country drained by its southern branch, the Watson- 



248 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

quah. The examination was continued until Fort George was reached. In 
the same year Mr. Joseph Hunter crossed the mountains by the Pine River 
Pass. These explorations, however, only tended to confirm Sir Sandford 
Fleming in the opinion that the Yellowhead route was the most practicable. 

Mr. Marcus Smith had special charge of the surveys on the Pacific 
Coast, and during the four years which he spent in this region he was chiefly 
engaged in exploring the harbors at the various suggested termini. Every 
harbor was examined and with the assistance of admiralty charts and from 
conversations with officers of the Royal Navy and officials of the Hudson's 
Bay Company, much valuable information was gained. Mr. Smith stated 
in a report, dated March 29th, 1878, that there was no harbor on the Coast 
of the Mainland of British Columbia, with the exception of Port Simpson, 
suitably located for purposes of foreign commerce. He added, however, 
that on the coast of Vancouver Island there were several harbors well situated 
for commerce with Asia. Port Simpson, he pointed out, is easily approached 
from the ocean and is fully 500 miles nearer Yokohama than Holme's harbor 
in Puget Sound. But he added that this harbor is remote from the indus- 
trial centers of the Province, and could only be looked upon as the station 
to which the railway might ultimately proceed, providing the competition 
for the trade of China and Japan should warrant such an extension. In the 
light of current events, it is curious that so little importance was placed upon 
the value of Burrard Inlet as a great harbor for commerce. It is worthy of 
remark that the one harbor of the coast which attracted the least attention 
from the surveyors and explorers should have become the chief port of the 
western coast of British North America. 

From 187 1 until 1878 exploratory parties were sent out in all directions 
through the Province. Some nine different routes were explored through 
a country- the natural barriers of which would have discouraged and barred 
the progress of any but the most determined of men. When the history of 
the Province shall come to be written in detail, the storv of the adventures 



BRITISFI COLUMBIA 249 

and experiences of these who mapped out routes for our national highway 
will not be its least interesting- chapter. 

Sandford Fleming was extremely loath to recommend that the line 
should follow any particular route until careful examination could be made 
of the whole country. As he pointed out on more than one occasion it was 
a matter of the very gravest importance that the line should be built as 
economically as possible and through a country which it would be possible 
to settle. In his report of 1880, he remarked that irreparable injury might 
have been done to Canada by an unseemly haste in the selection of a route. 
If the railway had been constructed and later a better route found, the loss 
to the Dominion would have been incalculable. 

After passing through the Rockies there still remained the Cascade 
chain to pierce. This range rises between the central plateau on the one side 
and the coast on the other, and everywhere presents formidable difificulties. 
Through these mountains twelve passes were discovered and surveyed, eight 
of which were found practicable for railway construction. The route event- 
ually decided upon followed the Fraser River canon to the Coast. Gen- 
erally speaking there were four main routes suitable for the construction of 
the railway. They were as follows: 

1. Through the Peace River Pass to the Northern Coast of British 
Columbia at Port Simpson. 

2. Through the Yellowhead Pass to Port Essington. 

3. Through the Yellowhead Pass to Bute Inlet. 

4. Through Yellowhead Pass via Thompson River and Fraser River 
to Burrard Inlet. 

It was not until 1878 that the Government finally decided upon the last 
mentioned route, and a contract was signed with Mr. Onderdonk for the 
first portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the following year, as stated 
in the foregoing. Yellowhead Pass, however, was subsequently abandoned for 
one through the Bow River and the Kicking Horse Passes, regarding which 



260 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

it may be said that there ever will remain a dispute as to the wisdom of such 
a course. The C. P. R. certainly obtained a route which for scenic beauty 
and grandeur is unequalled on the continent of America and probably in 
the world, but what it gained in that respect it lost in grades, the advantage 
of which in the cost of hauling traffic is of the utmost importance. Sooner 
or later, and probably very soon, the Yellowhead Pass will be utilized by one 
or more trans-continental railways, either the Grand Trunk Pacific or the 
Canadian Northern, or both. 

In the year 1880 the Government of Canada was successful in organ- 
izing a syndicate, which under certain terms undertook to construct the 
railway and complete it by the first of May, 1891. It is unnecessary here 
to refer to the terms, except that $25,000,000 in cash and 25,000,000 acres 
of land were given as a bonus, with certain exemptions and privileges. The 
great work, which has been the most important factor in Canadian develop- 
ment, was prosecuted with such extraordinary vigor that it was completed 
in 1885, or five years before the time specified. History will not record 
anything more remarkable so far as the Dominion of Canada is concerned 
than the manner in which the undertaking was carried out. Especially in 
the canons and mountain fastnesses was it marked by great engineering 
feats and attended by perils to life. There was an army of men employed. 
It was a contest between the ingenuity, skill and daring of men against huge 
natural obstacles in which the former wtdu a notable victory. It is the con- 
stant wonder of travelers as they view the mountainous environments and 
the engineering accomplishments how it was all done. Not less even were 
the mechanical difficulties than the financial ability necessary to carry the 
work through to completion. There was a time when the fate of the enter- 
prise and that of Canada hung in the balance. The promoters, who, though 
they ultimately reaped a harvest from its construction, backed it to the ut- 
most of their credit and resources, and might even then have failed had not the 
Government, whose credit and that of the country were at stake as well, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 251 

come to their rescue with a temporary loan, which, by the way, was all repaid 
in due time. 

The completion of this gigantic undertaking was the practical fulfill- 
ment of the Terms of Union. There was, however, another part of these 
which was fulfilled about the same time. The Carnarvon terms provided 
that a line of railway should be built on the Island of Vancouver, and the 
failure of the Dominion Government to carry out its agreement was a stand- 
ing and a substantial grievance. Mr. Higgins has in a previous chapter 
given a great many details of the settlement. In 1883 the terms of what is 
known as the Settlement Act were arranged, by which all the outstanding 
issues between the Province and the Dominion were disposed of. By this 
act a subsidy of $750,000 was pledged by the Dominion Government for the 
construction of the island railway, which, with a liberal grant of land from 
the Provincial Government, secured the construction and completion of the 
Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway. By the act in question the dry dock at 
Esquimalt, construction of which had been begun under the Walkem-Beaven, 
administration, provided that upon its completion the Government of Canada 
should take it over and operate it as a Dominion work; that the Dominion 
Government should be entitled to have conveyed to it all lands belonging 
thereto, together with the Imperial appropriation, and pay to the Province as 
the price thereof $250,000 in addition to the amounts that had been expended 
or remained due up to the passing of the act. The province, as an equiva- 
lent for the $750,000 bonus in cash to the E. &amp; N. Railway Company, agreed 
to convey to the Dominion Government 3,500,000 acres in the Peace River 
district, the whole area to be selected in one rectangular block. The enter- 
ing into confederation in 1870 was merely formal, the reality came about 
and the Province was satisfied only when it was assured beyond all doubt 
that the railway for which it bargained with the Dominion would be com- 
pleted. As stated in the chapter on Confederation there was very little senti- 
ment involved. Now, however, the commercial spirit that propelled the 



252 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

movement from its inception until its consummation has been largely elimin- 
ated, and the people of British Columbia, in common with the people of the 
rest of Canada, share in that feeling of brotherhood that should actuate the 
whole of the citizens of one nation. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 253 



. • CHAPTER XL 

GOVERNORS AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNORS OF BRITISH 

COLUMBIA. 

The official lives of the Governors and Lieutenant Governors of British 
Columbia embody the political history of fifty years, and incidentally em- 
brace much else of interest. In colonial days the Governor was a factor in 
politics, representing Imperial interests and in a large measure Imperial 
politics. His personal influence, too, counted for much more than it has 
in the case of latter day Governors, because he had greater power to enforce 
his views on his Executive Council, of which he was one de facto, as well as 
in name. Before the days of responsible government in British Columbia, 
at it was in the old Canadas, the Legislative Assembly was rather an ad- 
visory than a governing body, and as the real head of the Executive, the 
Governor possessed an authority which to assert today would be dangerous. 

Responsible government brought with it to the Dominion and to the 
Province the complete recognition of the right of the people, through their 
representatives elect, to govern. Parliament is supreme, and the Government 
or Executive, while by an unwritten code of proxy is entrusted, as the best 
modern solution of practical Government, with a large measure of discretion- 
ary powers, its will is, nevertheless, in the final analysis, but the registered 
index of the popular will, and the Governor or Lieutenant Governor simply 
affixes his seal to the fiat of the court of public opinion. 

The one was the direct representative of the Imperial Government, with 
a large measure of control and influence, and the other, under responsible 
government, is an indirect representative, whose authority, except under 



264 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

extraordinary circumstances, is derived solely from the people over whom 
he is nominally set to govern. 

In the one case, in dealing with the Governors, we are dealing with part 
of the policy which directed public affairs, in the other we have a series of 
pegs which may or may not be convenient upon which to hang current his- 
tory. 

When the colonial Governors assumed office they were waited upon 
by delegations and memorialized on public matters and were authoritative and 
sometimes mandatory in their replies. 

Now representations are sometimes made to the Governor, but not 
strictly in matters of State, or if by courtesy this is done, they are referred 
to the Executive. His influence is often sought, but, if exerted, is done so 
unofficially, and need not necessarily be respected. The Home Govern- 
ment may seek advice from the Governor of Canada independently respect- 
ing matters of Imperial interest, but as a rule he is simply the medium of 
communication between the tw^o Governments. The same thing may occur 
in regard to Dominion and provincial affairs, but a similar rule applies. 

Richard Blanshard. 

It is usual to regard Sir James Douglas as the first Governor of British 
Columbia, but, although he was virtually the first, nominally he was not. 
The consideration of Blanshard's place in our history carries us back to the 
time of Hudson's Bay Company rule, when that corporation exercised sov- 
ereign control not only over Vancouver Island but over a vast tract of terri- 
tory known as Rupert's Land, as well as exclusive trading rights over an- 
other vast area known as the Indian Territory. It may be said of Blanshard, 
as has been said of many another good man in a somewhat different sense, 
that he was before his time. Space will not permit of my going into a con- 
sideration of all the circumstances connected with his appointment and the 
tenure of his office as Governor. Bancroft and other writers on the Hud- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 255 

soli s Bay Company period have dealt with these, nor indeed, does the im- 
portance of his gubernatorial career justify elaborate treatment. He was 
appointed simply to satisfy the conditions of the time. Sir James Douglas 
would have been the man had it not been felt that (where the interests of the 
company and the colonist as such might at times come into conflict) one in- 
dependent of the company altogether would be desirable. Moreover, an 
independent appointee gave at least a semblance of Imperial above company 
control. Under other circumstances, the precaution would have been a very 
wise one, but there were practically none other than Hudson's Bay Company 
employes to govern, and thev owed no allegiance to any power other than 
the chief factor, who had neither inclination nor intention to acknowledge 
any governor other than the Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. A 
memorial presented to Governor Blanshard. which set out, among other 
things, the names of all the persons in the colony not connected directly with 
the Company, had fifteen signatures to it. and Blanshard himself solemnly 
asserts that there were not more than thirty persons of all sorts and condi- 
tions, that is, w^hite persons, outside of the company's employ. 

From what we know of Blanshard, he was a man of good parts, and 
under other circumstances would probably have succeeded in as great a de- 
gree as he failed at that time. In England the post of Governor of a Colony 
is regarded as one of honor and emolument, and we can in some measure 
judge of his disappointment when he landed in Victoria and fully realized 
for the first time the conditions then existing in this country. He found 
governing a hollow mockery. Upon his own testimony we learn that his 
only duties consisted in settling disputes between members of the company, 
or such as would form part of the work of an ordinary justice of the peace, 
and we cannot wonder at and can readily forgive the irritation he displayed 
and the pessimism of his letters and reports home. Without a population 
to govern, with scant recognition of his office, without official residence or 
a stipend and without even the undisputed sway of Alexander Selkirk over 



256 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the fowl and the brute, he nevertheless, as he wandered forlornly over his 
domain, could doubtless echo to the faintest whisper the sentiment of that 
other monarch when he exclaimed : 

"O Solitude, where are the charms 

That sages have seen in thy face? 
Better dwell in the midst of alarms 

Than reign in this horrible place." 

Coming out to Vancouver Island in January, 1850, he left again in 
185 1, his governorship extending over a term of about two years, and we 
hear of him again giving evidence before the Select Committee of the House 
of Commons in 1857, appointed to enquire into the title and the conditions 
of occupancy of land held by the Hudson's Bay Company, an opportunity 
that no doubt afforded him much satisfaction for the treatment he had re- 
ceived, treatment that cannot be described as other than shabby and un- 
deserved. He was succeeded by James Douglas, then chief factor of the 
Hudson's Bay Company on the Pacific Coast. Taking all things into con- 
sideration, Douglas was the only man at that time with any claim to the 
position who could have satisfactorily filled it. As already intimated prac- 
tically the only interests to be considered were those under his own care, and 
from his official standing in the company, he had almost perfect control of 
the population, as every person in the colony was directly or indirectly de- 
pendent on the company. He knew the whole country intimately, had the 
confidence and respect and a familiar knowledge of the Indians, and above 
all was a man born to rule. 

Sir James Douglas. 

I have referred to him elsewhere as " remarkable," and when the his- 
torian of the future comes to write dispassionately on British Columbia in a 
light uncolored by the atmosphere of the day and generation in which Sir 
James lived, that estimate of him will be fully sustained. To my mind the 
most remarkable feature of his career is the development of a character and

r. (I (» •■( 1 .1 h (&gt;

a personality unique in its fullness and moral strength. It was a character 
that grew up in and out of a western soil almost barbaric in the rudeness 
and primitiveness of its product, and yet so diverse in many respects that 
had it not been for its ruggedness and strength might be termed exotic. As 
a boy of sixteen out of school launched on a sea of Far West adventure, 
entirely removed from the social influences and culture comforts of his home 
in Scotland, associating for years with the uncivilized Indian tribes of the 
country, and moulded by the stern experience of an isolated life on prairie, 
in forest and on mountain; out of touch with the civilizing forces of the 
wonderful century in which he began life; engaged in an occupation that 
begat no ambitions or aspirations of a future that such a man in other walks 
of life might reasonably entertain — with such environments it is remarkable, 
I contend, that he should not only retain the accomplishments of his youth 
throughout life, but increase and perfect them ; acquire a knowledge of many 
subjects of an academic nature, and particularly of the principles of political 
economy and statescraft ; develop a strong literary style of composition and 
familiarize himself with formalities of government and parliamentary pro- 
cedure; nurture the moral and religious instincts of his youth; observe a be- 
coming temperance and abstemiousness ; cultivate a striking dignity of per- 
son; and in the midst of his busy life, full of practical and unromantic de- 
tails, keep abreast of the thought of his day, and that when he was called 
upon to fill the responsible and dignified position of Governor of one of 
Her Majest}^'s colonies, without any previous experience or training for 
such a post, he should do so with the utmost ability and acceptability. It 
is true that in many of the qualifications possessed by James Douglas — edu- 
cation, intelligence, tact, force of character, physical prowess, bravery, re- 
sourcefulness, systematic habits, dignity, moral rectitude — the Hudson's 
Bay Company service was a splendid training school, and it is only fair to 
say that our hero was but one, though a conspicuous member, of a long list 
of pioneers in the nobility of the fur trade to whom history can never do too 



258 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

much honor. In this respect, however, Douglas was particularly notable, 
that while he evinced many if not all of the better qualities of men of his 
class, he was singularly free from the moral defects and excesses, not un- 
natural in a rough and ready school of ethics through which all alike gradu- 
ated, that distinguished some of them. In his day, Sir James was undoubt- 
edly remarkable among many remarkable men, and it is not unnatural to 
conclude that under other conditions of life, and with a wider opportunity, 
would have equally distinguished himself as a man of affairs and as a leader 
of men. We can, therefore, honor him not only for what he was in life, 
but for what he might have been. 

James Douglas was born in 1803, in Lanarkshire, Scotland, and went to 
school there and in Chester, receiving a good education. His knowledge of 
French was acquired (not in the Northwest, as stated by Dr. Bryce), but 
from an old French count, who counselled him upon leaving for America to 
keep it up as it would always be useful to him. So well was the advice fol- 
lowed that when Sir James visited France on his journey through Europe 
many years afterwards, he was complimented upon his excellent and courtly 
use of the l&amp;ngiiage. He was a student until the day of his death, and his 
reading embraced a very wide range of subjects. 

Upon the formation of the two colonies under Imperial control in 1859, 
having severed his connection with the Hudson's Bay Company, he became 
governor of both, retiring in 1864 with the honor of knighthood. He died 
in 1877, after the problem of confederation and in a large measure that of 
railway connection, had been solved, thus living to behold in his own life- 
time,, the consummation of what as a pioneer and founder of a province he 
had been a factor in achieving. Whatever differences in opinion there may 
have been among his contemporaries as to his policy as a governor or what- 
ever may have been the varying estimates of his character as a man among 
men with whom he had personal relations — every strong man has his 
enemies and in all politics there is strife — that today he is by general con- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 259 

sensus of opinion regarded as the man representative of his times, the one 
about whose individuahty must cluster as a nucleus the materials for the 
history of the early life of British Columbia, is the strongest possible testi- 
mony to the part he played as a pioneer and statesman. 

After Douglas came three Governors, about whom the present genera- 
tion know but little, for while they were within the memory of many of the 
older inhabitants, as governors there was nothing special connected with 
their administrations to make their tenure of office memorable. During 
Sir James Douglas's regime British Columbia was in a purely formative 
stage. Permanency depended upon future developments. Regarding these, 
hopes had always been high, and prospects, though bright, were indefinite, 
and based on a sanguineness characteristic of a strong, hardy, brave, in- 
telligent and adventurous class of people, who, loving the freedom of West- 
ern life, had an instinctive faith in the country — a faith that has remained 
steadfast with them and us, and which is now finding its justification in 
many ways. All things come to those who know how to wait, is the true 
rendering of the old proverb, and waiting is being amply rewarded. 

Kennedy and Seymour. 

When Arthur Edward Kennedy and Frederick Seymour succeeded 
Douglas in the colonies of Vancouver Island and (the mainland of) Brit- 
ish Columbia, respectively, the country was settling down to an organized 
state of afifairs. There were separate political institutions in the Colonies, 
separate seats of Government, and a distinct separateness of feeling, which 
later crystallized into a sectionalism that had its influence for many a day 
afterwards, and is not yet wholly eliminated. After, however, the early 
mining excitements had subsided and Cariboo had been exploited, there was 
a period of long rest, during which development was slow and little change 
was experienced in the outward appearance of things. Political events were 
shaped largely upon the main issue of the union of the colonies, which was 



260 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

favored on the Island, and opposed on the Mainland. Governor Seymour, 
who had a fine residence in New Westminster, fought against the removal 
of the capital to Victoria, and even after that had been decided upon, de- 
layed the inevitable as long as possible in the hope that the Imperial authori- 
ties might .be influenced to change their views. The union, after a hard 
stniggle, was effected in 1866, when Governor Kennedy retired and Gov- 
ernor Seymour succeeded as Governor of all British Columbia. The first 
session after union was held in Victoria in 1867. One of the strong levers 
in bringing about union was the expense of the civil list, which high even 
for the united colonies, was burdensome when maintained separately in 
colonies with limited population and undeveloped resources. The salary of 
the governors alone was $15,000 a year each, and although the salary of 
Seymour was increased to $20,000 after the union, the saving was consid- 
erable, and in a similar way the expenditure for civil service was correspond- 
ingly reduced all round. 

I am indebted to- the Hon. D. W. Fliggins, ex-Speaker, for impressions 
of the early governors. Governor Kennedy arrived in Victoria on Good 
Friday, 1864, and was received with open arms and salvos of artillery. He 
had been a captain in the regular army and had seen service in India. Re- 
tired on captain's half pay, he had mixed in Imperial politics, and was a 
fluent and graceful speaker. Handsome in appearance, gray, decidedly 
military in his bearing, very suave, amiable, and clever, he was a striking 
figure and a man of character as well. While addressing a deputation of 
citizens from the steps of the Government buildings on one occasion he used 
the memorable expression that it was better to be decidedly wrong than un- 
decidedly right, a note that was attuned to his own policy. Governor Ken- 
nedy took a strong interest in the affairs of the colony and personally investi- 
gated the resources of the Island as far as was possible with a view to its 
betterment. The agitation for union of the colonies began early in his 
reign, and his influence was a strong factor in bringing it about. He had 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 261 

two daughters, one of whom married Lord Gilford, afterwards Governor 
of Queensland. 

Governor Seymour was a man of different stamp, smaller in physique 
and of nervous, active temperament. He was quite bald. He had been 
governor of British Honduras, where he had made a good record for him- 
self, but where his experience probably influenced his views of Colonial 
policy, and to some extent his disposition. His advent to office as Governor 
of the united colonies was coincident with the completion of the Atlantic 
cable, which brought his instructions respecting union, and which as has been 
seen he delayed as long as possible before carrying into effect. Seymour 
continued in office until June, 1869, in which year his death occurred. He 
died on board Her Majesty's ship Sparrowhawk at Bella Coola, whither he 
had gone on a trip for his health. After coming to British Columbia he re- 
turned to England and married there. 

The principal feature of his Governorship was the movement for union 
with Canada, which began almost immediately as soon as the lesser union 
had been effected. Seymour used all the influence in his power in its favor, 
and as the policy of the Home Government in this matter was well known, 
he undoubtedly acted under instructions. 

Sir Anthony Musgrave. 

Sir Anthony Musgrave succeeded, and by this time Confederation was 
the one absorbing issue. Curiously enough, in contrast with the attitude 
on the union of the colonies, Confederation was strongly supported on the 
Mainland, while the principal opposition came from the Island, although 
there was a strong party in Victoria in its favor. There was also an in- 
significant element advocating annexation with the United States. Mus- 
grave's instructions were explicit on the subject, and his mission as Governor 
had principally that end in view. His efforts, backed up by Imperial in- 
fluence, strong even to the point of command, brought the issue to a head 



262 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

sooner than it otherwise would have been, and in the end sentiment wa&amp; 
unanimous in its favor. 

The year 1871 saw Confederation an accomplished fact, and with it 
came responsible government. Musgrave's services upon his retirement were 
recognized by knighthood. , He is described as a tall, slim, handsome man, 
of excellent parts and intellectual attainments. In the West Indies, where 
he had written himself into the notice and favor of the Governor of St. Vin- 
cent, he had been a journalist, and with favor came well deserved prefer- 
ment. During his residence in British Columbia he had the misfortune, 
while riding, to break his leg. His sister, Mrs. Dodgson, still lives in Vic- 
toria, and another sister married Mr, John Trutch, an engineer, formerly 
Land Commissioner of the E. &amp; N. Railway, well known to all old Victo- 
rians. 

Sir Joseph Trutch. 

After Confederation, as was proper, the honor of being the first Lieu- 
tenant-Governor fell to the lot of a British Columbian, who had been long 
and prominently identified with its affairs as a member of the Legislative 
Assembly and as Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works and Surveyor- 
General — Sir Joseph W. Trutch. He had been one of the three delegates 
who went to Ottawa to arrange the terms of Confederation, and after the 
successful completion of his mission returned to Victoria with his commission 
as governor in his pocket, and was appointed in July, 187 1. During his 
term of office, responsible government and the initiation of the work of sur- 
veying the C. P. R. line of railway came about. Sir Joseph acquired con- 
siderable wealth, and subsequent to his retirement from office he went to Eng- 
land to live, but although he had his residence mainly there, he continued 
to have large interests in the Province, being one of the heavy shareholders 
in the Hall mines and smelter at Nelson, B. C. He died very recently. Sir 
Joseph Trutch was a man of more than ordinary ability; but, although 
estimable in every respect, had personal qualities which did not render him 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 263 

popular. He was careful in business matters, exact in the fulfillment of his 
official duties, and was at all times concerned that the dignity of his person 
or office should not suffer. When he retired, in 1876, he did so retaining 
the respect of the citizens generally. 

Sir Joseph was the son of an English solicitor, who was afterwards 
Clerk of the Peace in St. Thomas, Jamaica, where he married the daughter 
of a Judge of the Supreme Court, and where Sir Joseph was born. The latter 
was educated at Exeter, England, and was trained -as a civil engineer. In 
1849 he came out to the Pacific Coast and practiced engineering in California 
and Oregon, and was thus a pioneer of pioneers in mining life on this coast. 
Afterwards he was assistant engineer on the Illinois and Michigan canal and 
on the Illinois River improvement works. In 1855 he married a daughter 
of Mr. Louis Hyde, of New York. In 1859 he came to Victoria, and up 
until 1864 was employed on the construction of public works in British Co- 
lumbia, notably on the section through the cafion of the Eraser River and 
the wagon road from Yale to Cariboo, including the suspension bridge over 
the Eraser River, built by him under the terms of a toll charter. He suc- 
ceeded Lieutenant-Colonel Moody, R. E., as Chief Commissioner of Lands 
and Works and Surveyor-General of the Province in 1866. 

Hon. a. N. Richards. 

The Hon. Albert Norton Richards, Q. C, who succeeded Sir Joseph 
Trutch, was a man of considerable prominence in the old Canadas before 
coming to this province, having sat for South Leeds in the Canadian Assem- 
bly of Canada from the general elections of 1863 until January, 1864, and 
for the same constituency for the House of Commons from the general elec- 
tion of 1872 to the dissolution in 1874. Eor a brief period in 1863-64 he 
was a member of the Executive Council of Canada and Solicitor-General of 
Upper Canada. He was a brother of the late Chief Justice of Canada. When 
Hon. William McDougall, C. B., made his memorable trip to the Northwest 



264 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

in 1869 to be Governor of Manitoba, Mr. Richards accompanied him as 
Attorney-General in the provisional government about to be established in 
that province. 

As is well known, owing to the rebellion headed by Louis Riel, the pro- 
posed arrangements fell through. He was afterwards for several years legal 
agent of the Dominion Government in British Columbia. It was during his 
term of office here in Government House, and during the latter part of that 
of his predecessor, as well as during the early part of that of his successor in 
office, that the most notable agitation in the history of British Columbia took 
place. I refer to the trouble over the non-fulfillment of the terms of Con- 
federation with reference tO' the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. 
It is a long chapter, with many incidents, including the change of the terminus 
from Esquimau to Port Moody, the Hon. Mr. Walkem's mission to England, 
and Carnarvon Terms, mass meetings and memorials, the secession cry, Lord 
Duflferin's celebrated peace mission in connection herewith, the demand for 
an Island railway, the Settlement Act, and many others, which all finally 
culminated in a full and satisfactory adjustment of provincial grievances and 
a new era of development of which we have already reaped the first fruits. 

Governor Richards was a man of character, intellectual ability, highly 
developed legal attainments and rugged honesty. He was plain and unas- 
suming, an effective, but not eloquent pleader, and a sturdy old-time Re- 
former, who never swerved in his allegiance to Baldwin liberalism. Had his 
party been in power at an earlier period prior to his death, his services and 
conspicuous ability would doubtless have been recognized. Born in 1822, 
twice married, made a Q. C. in 1863, always a leader at the bar, and a promi- 
nent Provincial Bencher, he died within recent years. Other men with no 
greater ability perhaps took a more prominent part in provincial life than he 
did, but none have earned a higher place in the esteem of the people of 
British Columbia as an able and honorable man. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 265 

Cornwall. 

Lieutenant-Governor Cornwall followed. The son of an English clergy- 
man, he was born in 1839 at Ashcroft, Gloucestershire, England; was educated 
in and graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, as B. A. in 1856; called 
to the bar in 1862; came to British Columbia in the same year; was admitted 
to the bar here in 1865 ; was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1864-65, 
and was a member of that body at the time the terms of Confederation were 
agreed upon ; was made a senator in that year and continued to sit as a sup- 
porter of Sir John Macdonald until his appointment as Lieutenant-Governor 
in 1881; was appointed a judge of the County Court of Cariboo in 1889; 
married in 1871 the daughter of Rev. A. G. Pemberton, rector of Kensal 
Green, London, England. His term of office expired in 1886, just after the 
C. P. R. had been completed to the coast and was in full operation; 

Nelson. 

Upon the retirement of Cornwall, another pioneer of the province came 
to the front as Lieutenant-Governor in the person of the Hon. Hugh Nelson, 
than whom as a pioneer none was better known or appreciated. He was the 
son of a linen manufacturer, Robert Nelson, of Larne, County Antrim, Ire- 
land, and was born in 1830; came to the province in 1858 by way of Cali- 
fornia, whither he had gone in 1854. He settled in Yale as a merchant and 
was also interested in the express business under the well known firm name 
of Dietz &amp; Nelson, running an express line from Victoria as far as Yale. 
His business prospering, he engaged in many other enterprises, notable among 
which was his successful venture as a partner in the lumbering firm of Moody, 
Dietz &amp; Nelson, Moody ville, now opposite the city of Vancouver, where a 
large lumbering business was carried on for many years. As might be ex- 
pected, he early took an interest in public affairs. He was a member of the 
famous Yale Convention, called to further the interests of Confederation, 
and of the last Legislative Assembly of the colony of British Columbia. 



266 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Immediately after Confederation he was elected to represent New West- 
minster district in the House of Commons and continued to do so until the 
year 1879, when he was appointed to the Senate. He retired from business 
altogether in 1882, and was married in 1885 to Emily, daughter of J. B. 
Stanton, of the civil service of Canada, who survived him. 

Hon. E. Dewdney. 

Mr. Nelson's successor was the Hon. Edgar Dewdney, C. E., another 
prominent pioneer of the province, who came to British Columbia in 1859. 
In the early days he was identified with various mining enterprises in Cariboo 
and elsewhere, and built the well known Dewdney Trail, which penetrates 
the province to its eastern boundary. He first sat for Kootenay in the Leg- 
islative Assembly of British Columbia in 1868-69, ^"^ ^^ the House of Com- 
mons from 1872-79, when he was appointed Indian Commissioner; and again 
for East Assiniboia from September 12, 1888, until November, 1892. He 
was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Northwest Territory, 3rd Decem- 
ber, 1 88 1, until 3rd July, 1888. He was a member of the Privy Council, 
Minister of the Interior and ex-officio Superintendent-General of Indian 
Affairs, 3rd August, 1888, to 2nd November, 1892, when he became Lieu- 
tenant-Governor. 

Hon. T. R. McInnes. 

In 1896 the defeat of the Liberal-Conservative administration resulted 
in the appointment of a Liberal to the office of Lieutenant-Governor in the 
person of the Hon. T. R. McInnes, M. D. This was followed soon after by 
the general elections in the province. The events which grew out of the 
appointment of Senator McInnes to office really form a sort of turning point 
in the political history of British Columbia, and as they are recent, are within 
the memory of almost every person in the province. Political development 
had reached the point where there was a parting of the ways between new 
and old conditions. Many new-comers, who had begun to take a prominent 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 267 

interest in public affairs had created an atmosphere wholly different from 
that of the past. That element was assisted and materially strengthened by 
the members of the party that had been opposed to the administration of the 
Hon. J. H. Turner, and several other administrations of which his was the 
logical successor. There was also the feeling of the Mainland as against 
the Island of Vancouver, which had long protested against what was alleged 
to be the undue political influence and ascendancy of the Island in considera- 
tion of its limited area and population, as compared with those of the Main- 
land. It is not possible in limited space to go fully into all the circumstances 
of the situation at that time, which was peculiarly of a transitionary char- 
acter. Mr. Joseph Martin, only recently come to the province from Mani- 
toba, where he had been a prominent figure and a political factor of more 
than ordinary force, stepped into his natural position of the leader of the 
new and disturbing forces, and gave expression in a forcible and rather ex- 
plosive way to their views. The history of the remarkable episodes which 
followed is given impartially here. Briefly, after the general election of 
1898 the result was very much in doubt, with Cassiar to hear from. In the 
ordinary way the Premier of the day would have been permitted to meet 
the Legislature and determine his strength on the floor of the House. Lieu- 
tenant-Governor Mclnnes took the extraordinary course of dismissing the 
Turner Ministry on the grounds that it had ceased to possess his confidence. 
He, however, did a more remarkable thing still, in calling upon Mr. Robert 
Beaven, who was not in the Legislature, and had been a defeated candidate 
at the general election, to form a government. In fact, at that time Mr. 
Beaven, though a skilful parliamentarian and a man of long political experi- 
ence, had no political status so far as an existing party was concerned, and 
had no following. He was not even allied with the existing recognized op- 
position, of which Mr. C. A. Semlin was the acknowledged leader. Mr. 
Beaven very naturally failed to get a ministry together and then the Lieu- 
tenant-Governor turned to Mr. Semlin. The latter selected, among others, 



268 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. MArtin, who has been described as the " stormy petrel " of Canadian 
poh'tics, as his Attorney-General, and Mr. F. C. Cotton, editor of the News- 
Advertiser, Vancouver, as his Finance Minister, two of the ablest public men 
of the province, but temperamentally and in their methods very unlike. It 
was not long before they were at cross purposes and in strong antagonism to 
each other. It was simply a question of time as to which of the two should 
remain in the cabinet to the exclusion of the other, and the rashness and 
open indiscretion of the Attorney-General furnished the opportunity for Mr. 
Cotton to demand his resignation. As a result of a party caucus, Mr. Martin 
stepped out and went into active and effective opposition to the Government. 
With a small majority to start with, the Government, at the following meet- 
ing of the Legislature, found itself practically in power by the vote of the 
Speaker. It struggled along for a time, but, through the defection of Mr. 
Prentice, who afterwards became Finance Minister in the Dunsmuir Govern- 
ment, Mr. Semi in was defeated upon a vote of want of confidence, by which 
a crisis was brought about. Subsequently, however, a compromise was ef- 
fected by the Premier with some members of the opposition for their sup- 
port, and he was enabled to advise his Honor that he could command the 
support of a majority of the members of the House. Contrary to Consti- 
tutional precedent, the Lieutenant-Governor refused to be further advised by 
the Semlin Ministry, whose dismissal followed immediately. A second time 
the Governor did a remarkable thing. He called in Mr. Martin, who stood 
absolutely alone in the House, as Premier. Prorogation under unusual and 
somewhat boisterous circumstances, took place, and the Premier proceeded to 
form his ministry, which he did by selecting four men as colleagues who 
were not in politics, had never had a seat in the Legislature, and were prac- 
tically unknown outside of their respective places of abode. As was re- 
marked on more than one occasion, the procedure followed was making a 
travesty of constitutional government. As soon as the voter's list could be 
made in readiness, general elections were held. There was a general uncer- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 269 

tainty as to the political lines upon which many of the members returned, but 
Mr. Martin could not count more than seven out of the number. His Honor, 
having acted upon his own responsibility in dismissing the Semlin Govern- 
ment and calling into existence a Government to succeed it, and not having 
been sustained by the country in the course pursued, his own retirement was 
inevitable. In other words, in departing from well understood constitutional 
methods, he took his official life in his hand. His dismissal came almost 
immediately from Ottawa, whereupon he became once more plain Dr. Mc- 
Innes, being neither Lieutenant-Governor nor Senator. He lived in retire- 
ment afterwards in Vancouver, and died four years later. 

Dr. Mclnnes, like his predecessors, was a pioneer in the province, having 
moved from Dresden, Ontario, in 1874, where he practiced medicine. While 
continuing in medicine, he began to take an interest in public affairs almost 
immediately after his arrival. He was Mayor of New Westminster from 
1876-78, and elected for the district for the House of Commons in 1878 as 
a supporter of Sir John Macdonald. He was called to the Senate in 1881, 
in which body he was prominent in debate in all matters pertaining to British 
Columbia. He married in 1865, the relict of the late George M. Webster, 
Dresden, Ontario, who still survives him. He is succeeded in public life by 
his eldest son, Hon. W. W. B. Mclnnes, Commissioner of Yukon, who has 
occupied a seat in the Dominion House of Commons, also in the local Leg- 
islature and was for a time a member of the Prior administration. 

Sir Henri Joly de Lotbiniere. 

By a somewhat peculiar coincidence, the Hon. Sir Henri Gustave Joly 
de Lotbiniere, who had been called upon to form an administration in Quebec 
at the time Lieutenant-Governor Letellier had dismissed the De Boucherville 



Government in 1878, succeeded Governor Mclnnes in somewhat similar cir- 
cumstances. As a statesman to whose career and personality attaches special 



270 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

interest, I beg to reproduce here a sketch of Sir Henri's Hfe which appears 
in Morgan's " Canadian Men and Women of the Time," 

" Hon. Sir Henri Gustave Joly de Lotbiniere, statesman, is the eldest 
son of the late Gaspard Pierre Gustave Joly, a Huguenot native of France, 
who became Seigneur de Lotbiniere by his marriage with Julie Christine 
Chartier de Lotbiniere, granddaughter of the last Marquis de Lotbiniere, 
engineer-in-chief of New France. Born in France, December 5, 1829, he 
was educated at the Keller School, Paris, in company with the late Mr. Wad- 
dington, the French Minister. Coming to Canada, he devoted himself to 
the study of law and was called to the Quebec bar, 1855. He practiced his 
profession in the city and district of Quebec, and was created a Q. C. 1878. 
A Liberal politically, he was returned in tliat interest to the Canadian Assem- 
bly, general election, 1861, as the representative of the county of Lotbiniere. 
He took a prominent part in the debates on the Confederation of the provinces, 
1865-66, joining Messrs. Dorion; Holton, Huntington and other Liberal 
leaders from Lower Canada, in opposition to that measure. In the first 
election for the United Provinces, 1867, he was returned to the House of 
Commons and to the Provincial Assembly. He remained a member of both 
these bodies until 1874, when at the abolition of dual representation he elected 
to remain in the local Legislature. He led the opposition in the assembly 
against the De Boucher ville Government until March, 1878, when, on the 
dismissal of his ministers by Lieutenant-Governor Letellier, he (Mr. Joly) 
was called to the Premiership. While at the head of the Government, he 
initiated and carried out a vigorous policy of retrenchment, as well as of 
political purity. The salaries of the ministers and the indemnity of members 
of the Legislature were reduced. An effort was made to abolish the Legis- 
lative Council and all unnecessary outlays were cut off. Defeated in the 
House, 1879, he resigned, and from that time up to 1883, was again the leader 
of the opposition. In 1885, he retired from public life in consequence of his 
disapproval of the course of the Liberal party and on the Riel question. He 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 271 

re-appeared on the surface, June, 1893, as a delegate to the Reform Con- 
vention at Ottawa, and was then elected vice-chairman of that important 
gathering. Later, in February, 1894, he undertook a mission of peace and 
good-will to the Province of Ontario, to dispel the prejudice existing there 
against the people of the Province of Quebec, and to bring about a better 
feeling between the two provinces. In February, 1895, 'i" response to a 
general call from his party, he agreed to return to public life, and from that 
time took an active part in the agitation which led to Sir Wilfrid Laurier's 
success at the polls at the general election, 1896. During the contest he was 
returned to the House of Commons for Portneuf. On the formation of the 
new administration at Ottawa, he was offered and accepted the office of Con- 
troller of Inland Revenue. He became a Privy Councillor with the title of 
Minister of Inland Revenue, June 30, 1897. He is an Honorary D. C. L. of 
Lennoxville University (1887), an LL. D. of Queen's University (1894), 
and in acknowledgment of his public services received the K. C. M. G. from 
Her Majesty, May, 1895. He declined a seat in the Senate in 1874, and 
again in 1877. In the latter year he also declined a seat, with the office of 
Minister of Agriculture, in the Mackenzie administration. Sir Henri is 
known all over the continent for his interest in agriculture, horticulture and 
forestry, having written and spoken frequently on these subjects. 

" During the existence of the Imperial Federation League, he gave the 
scheme his entire support, and he is now as warmly inclined towards the 
British Empire League. He is also connected with the United Empire Loy- 
alist Association. In religious belief he is a member of the Church of Eng- 
land, and has served as a delegate to the diocesan and provincial synods of 
the Church. In 1888 he was authorized by the Quebec Legislature to add 
de Lotbiniere, his mother's name, to that of Joly. He married in 1856, Mar- 
garette Josepha, daughter of the late Hammond Gowen, of Quebec. Their 
eldest son, Edmund, adopted the legal profession. His two other sons are 



272 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

in the British Army, and are now and have been for some time, employed as 
officers in India." 

Sir Henri, during the term of his office, now coming to a close, has 
endeared himself to all classes, and won the respect and esteem of those with 
whom he has come into contact. He has taken a keen interest in everything 
pertaining to the welfare of the province.

CHAPTER XII. 

MATERIAL RESOURCES. 

The future of British Columbia, more than that of any other province 
of Canada, is based upon its material resources. The first, best known and 
the greatest of these is undoubtedly that of mining. In preceding chapters 
details have been given of the discovery of placer gold, and the rush of popu- 
lation which accompanied it. How recent, however, is the knowledge of 
mineral wealth existing on the Northwest coast, may be judged from the fact 
that Robert Greenhow, who in 1844 published a book dealing with the his- 
torical basis of the Oregon Boundary dispute, not then settled, wrote as fol- 
lows : " Oregon, indeed, contains land in small detached portions which may 
afford to the industrious cultivator the means of subsistence, and, also per- 
haps, in time, of procuring some foreign luxuries ; but it produces no precious 
metals, no opium, no cotton, no rice, no sugar, no coffee ; nor is it, like India, 
inhabited by a numerous population, who may be easily forced to labor for 
the benefit of the few. With regard to commerce, it offers no great advan- 
tages, present or immediately prospective. It contains no harbor in which 
articles of merchandise from other countries will probably at any future period 
be deposited for re-exportation; while the extreme irregularity of its surface 
and the obstruction to the navigation of its rivers, the removal of which is 
hopeless, forbid all expectation that the productions of China, or any other 
country bordering on the Pacific, will ever be transported across Oregon to 
the Atlantic regions of the continent." 

Oregon, as it was then known, was of indefinite extent, including the 
whole of the Pacific coast, north of California, as far as Alaska; containing 
within its limits what are now the states of Oregon and Washington and 



274 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the Province of British Columbia, exclusive of New Caledonia, which lay at 
the northeast corner, and was indisputably British territory. 

Greenhow was then, probably, the best informed man on the subject in 
America, and was arguing that possession of this vast country, except for po- 
litical reasons, was of no particular advantage to either the United States or 
Great Britain. This was the opinion expressed by the majority of writers 
on the subject of the Oregon territory, and was undoubtedly based on the 
best information available. 

At that time the Hudson's Bay , Company, although their officials had 
prospected the whole of the territory for furs, had not observed mineral indi- 
cations sufficient to justify any other conclusions. How greatly mistaken 
Greenhow was in the statement that there were " no precious metals " it is 
not necessary to comment upon, at the time, since the whole of the former 
Oregon territory has been demonstrated to be richly mineralized, and is, and 
has been producing a vast amount of mineral wealth. 

David Douglas, the gifted scientist, who botanized the country in the 
early twenties, discovered a deposit of lead-silver, in what is now known as 
the Blue-Bell mine, on Kootenay Lake, from which it is alleged the Indians 
used to get a supply of lead with which to make bullets. 

Early History of Mining. 

Just how and where gold was first discovered in British Columbia is not 
easy to state with precision. The early discoveries of gold in small quanti- 
ties range between the years 1850 and 1857. In 1850 specimens came from 
Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Islands. An incipient mining boom 
took place at Queen Charlotte Islands in 185 1 and 1852. Dr. Dawson says 
that from one little pocket or seam of gold in Gold Harbor, Moresby Island, 
between $20,000 and $75,000 were taken, or were reported to have been taken. 
It is also stated by others that more was lost in the harbor in the operation 
of mining than was recovered. However much or little, the " find " ended 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 275 

there. About the same time Indians from up the Skeena River brought 
pieces of gold to the Hudson's Bay Company's fort, but the several expedi- 
tions to find it in place met with failure. 

In the interior, gold was found in the Natchez Pass and Similkameen as 
early as 1852, and in 1854 Colville Indians were known to have had nuggets 
in their possession. It is stated in Bancroft that Chief Trader McLean pro- 
cured gold dust from Indians near Kamloops in 1852. Various authorities 
place the first finds at various places. However, between 1855 and 1857, 
discoveries were made on the Thompson, on the Fraser, on the Columbia and 
at Colville, and the news of these discoveries, together with the despatches of 
Governor Douglas soon attracted attention to British Columbia as a possible 
gold field. Exploiting for gold was stimulated by the California excite- 
ment, and the discovery of any new field was sure to produce a rush. Sev- 
eral parties prospected and worked on the Fraser and Thompson Rivers in 
1857 with good success, and the news caused the Fraser River excitement, 
many of the participants in which are still living. 

The story has already been told of the rush of 1858 to the Fraser 
River, and the subsequent discovery of immensely rich placers in the Cariboo 
country. It was the discovery and exploitation of this gold that gave popu- 
lation and permanency to the Colony of British Columbia, and converted 
it from a fur-bearing preserve for the Hudson's Bay Company, to a regularly 
constituted and politically organized British domain. 

Up to 1866, the principal operations were confined to Caribooj but 
there were in the meantime, several lesser excitements, notably the discovery 
of rich placer deposits in Similkameen, at Rock Creek, Boundary Creek and 
on Wild Horse Creek in the Kootenay district, in the extreme southeast- 
ern part of the province. Then the Leech River excitement in 1864, in the 
southern part of Vancouver Island. And again the Big Bend excitement of 
1865. The dqDOsits of the last named place were found to be rich, but 
the inaccessibility of the region, the total lack of facilities for bringing in 



276 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

provisions, and the great hardships consequent upon prospecting and mining 
in this district, proved too great for continued success, and the excitement 
quickly subsided. It is quite probable, however, that the Big Bend country 
will soon again excite the interest of miners and prove a rich field for them. 

Shortly after the discovery of Cariboo gold mines, the restless pros- 
pector began pushing his investigations further North, and in 1869, the 
Omineca Country was reached, where an excitement of not inconsiderable 
dimensions took place and numbers rushed in. These mines were fairly 
remunerative for a time, and have been more or less operated ever 
since, but in 1872 the rich northern mines of the Cassiar district, at the 
head waters of the Dease, were brought to light, and the second most notable 
mining epoch was effected. Out of this district, some five or six millions of 
dollars in gold were taken. True to his instinct, after the first richness 
of the Cassiar creeks was exhausted, the prospector pushed further and 
further North, until finally in 1880 gold was found in paying quantities in 
the tributaries of the Yukon. 

In 1897, rich discoveries of gold having been made in the tributaries 
of the Yukon, in .the vicinity of where Dawson City now is, another memor-^ 
abh rush took place, and one which m.ust, in historical importance, rank 
next to the Cariboo excitement. The Yukon has been a rich fteld, and has 
yielded up annually large quantities of. gold ever since. 

Attention having been directed to the Northern country, it was exten- 
sively prospected, an,d other mining camps were .opened ; up^ with more 
or less success. One of these was just within the Northern boundaries of 
British Colun;ibia, in Atlin District, which has yielded from $500,000 to 
$1,000,000 a year since 18^.. 

In 1885, Granite Creek, a tributary of l^he ,Sirnilkameen, afforded evi- 
dence of rich placers, and a small -''rush " occurred, and although not so 
rich as was reported at fi,rst, it has ever since occnipied the attention of pros- 
pectors. , , ,; 



BRITISH COLUMBIA m 

Coal, still the predominant wealth producer in minerals in this province, 
was known to exist at a much earlier period than was gold. It was dis- 
covered at Fort Rupert in 1835, '^"^ ^^^^ "^^^' ^" small quantities. The 
Indians are credited with making its existence known to the whites, the cir- 
cumstances being ascribed to an accident. Some development work was done 
at Fort Rupert by the Hudson's Bay Company, but the mines there were 
abandoned in 185 1 for those at Nanaimo, which were discovered in a man- 
ner somewhat similar to those at Fort Rupert. The Indians had observed 
a blacksmith using coal, and had informed him that there was plenty of such 
black stone at Nanaimo, which, upon investigation, proved to be true. The 
work of mining was begun in 185 1, and has never been discontinued. 

Coal is said to have been fotmd at Burrard Inlet in an outcropping on 
the shore, and H. M. S. " Phmiper " obtained enough of it there to steam the 
ship to Nanaimo. No subsequent indications have been reported. Borings 
in the vicinity have proved unsuccessful in revealing' a paying deposit. The 
coal beds of Queen Charlotte Island, now attracting some attention, were dis- 
covered as far back as 1852, and anthracite was known to exist 

The finding of coal at Departure Bay by the late Hon. Robert Duns- 
muir, and its subsequent development by him into the great industry it is at 
present, and the fortune it brought with it, are too well known to require 
detailed mention here. From 3,oc«3 tons in 1852 the output has gradually 
risen to 1,000,000 tons (in round numbers) per annum. 

Placer and Lode Mining. 

Placer mining in British Columbia has followed the usual course of 
events in all gold-bearing countries. After the richest deposits had been 
worked over by the ordinary methods, the annual yield began to decline. 
Cariboo saw its best days in 1863 and 1864. The experience of every 
other camp has been the same. The output of 1863 was about $4,000,000. 
Thirty years later it was $360,000, when it reached its lowest ebb. Then 



278 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the scale began to turn, and it has again reached over $i,cxx),ooo. There 
is a reason for that, not attributable to new finds, but to newer methods. 
Grounds that no longer paid by the use of the rocker, and sluicing, are being 
made remunerative by hydraulicing on a large scale, and the expenditure of 
large capital. Tliis promises a revolution, whereby the extensive auriferous 
areas of gravel and old river beds can be worked over. Extensive hydraul- 
icing plants have been inaugurated in Cariboo, notably that of the Consoli- 
dated Cariboo Hydraulicing Company, which has mining leases aggregating 
seveial thousand acres of land, all auriferous. It is estimated that there 
are 500,ooo,cxx) cubic yards, which are available for washing. Similar 
enterprises are contemplated in all the old mining camps, wherever conditions 
are favorable, so that the era of hydraulicing promises results even greater 
than in " ye olden times." Dredging and ground-sluicing are also receiving 
attention. 

There was a long interval between the time the harvest of alluvial dig- 
gings made British Columbia famous, and the time when lode-mining began 
to show results. At intervals along in the seventies and the eighties, there 
were valuable finds reported in the way of quartz veins, carrying silver and 
free gold principally. There was a silver mine at Hope, of which much 
was heard, and into which much money was put. There was the famous 
'' Black Jack " of Cariboo, which created a temporary quartz excitement, 
and relieved the public of a certain amount of money invested in shares. 
Monashee Mountain in Southern Yale, attracted a good deal of attention 
and some capital to it. The old silver trail leading from the main wagon 
road into Jordan Meadows, from Raymond's Crossing near Shawnigan 
Lake, on Vancouver Island, attests to faith in a silver mine, that was the 
base of a vision of wealth for some one. These early attempts, in the light 
of an understanding of the conditions which exist generally in British Colum- 
bia, were foredoomed to failure, even if the mineral had been " in place " 
according to anticipation. Many persons have wondered why it was that 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 279 

this province, if as rich and as widely mineralized as reported, did not de- 
velop faster as a mineral producer. In certain circles, as a result of " hope 
oft deferred," the impression did gain ground that British Columbia was 
a doubtful mining field, notwithstanding the rich surface exposures, and we 
heard a good deal about " broken formations " and " refractory ores," as an 
explf.nation of the unsatisfactory results of preliminary exploitation. Over 
and over again, the most sanguine anticipations were formed of some unusu- 
ally rich prospect, and the public, through the newspapers, each time felt 
confident of success ; but soon or later, according to the amount of funds at 
the disposal of the promoters, silence reigned regarding them, and the public, 
not in their confidence, wondered why. Now, the public were not " bun- 
coed," at least, in the majority of cases. The promoters believed in their 
properties implicitly, and backed their faith with their own capital. Failure 
was usually the result of not properly appreciating the conditions which 
make success in mining, They were not mistaken, but they were too soon. 
Like the pioneer, the inventor, and the reformer, who usually see the fruits 
of their efforts reaped by those who have not sown, they were just a little 
in advance of their time. The key to success lay in the providing of facilities 
of communication, without which it was impossible to win. There were 
otlicr things as well. Twenty or thirty years ago, had there been the railway 
facilities we possess today, many of the properties now worked at a profit, 
could not have been properly operated. The reason for this is, that the proc- 
esses of mining and smelting have so improved in that time, that the low 
grade ores, such as are being handled in great quantities in the Boundary 
and Rossland camps, would have been useless. Every mining country has 
its peculiarities, and its particular requirements, and time and experience 
are necessary to determine the processes and methods best suited to the treat- 
ment of its ores. 

Communication, however, was the principal want of the country in the 
early days of the development of quartz mines. It is yet, to a very large 



280 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

extent. Whatever are the metallurgical problems to be solved, no success can 
be achieved until there are railways, or tramways to connect mines with 
the waterways, affording cheap transportation. The successful mining camps 
today, are located only in those parts of the province, where such transporta- 
tion exists, as in the Boundary, Trail Creek and Slocan districts, in East 
Kootenay and on the coast of Vancouver Island. These have only touched 
the rim of the mining possibilities, within which are a vast field, over most of 
which prospectors have trodden, and discovered indications of mineral wealth. 
This field still waits the whistle of the railway train to make it alive with 
industry'. We have the promise of two more transcontinental railways, 
piercing the Rockies north of the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, within 
the next five years, and of one or two systems following the natural lines 
of travel north and south, after which will follow the inevitable network of 
branch lines. In twenty-five years from now, the province should be yield- 
ing $200,000,000 worth of minerals annually, instead of its present output of 
$20,000,000. 

The first quartz mining of any importance, was done at Camp McKin- 
ney, which was discovered in the year 1884. One mine there, the Cariboo- 
Amelia, paid dividends to the extent of $550,000, and only closed down in 
1903. Ainsworth, or as it was known in early days as Hot Springs, on the 
Kootenay Lake, was one of the first camps to be developed. Dr. Dawson, 
in 1889, found mining being actively carried on, and it had been for several 
years previous. About that time, prospecting and preliminary mining de- 
velopments were very active all through the West Kootenay country, and in 
parts of East Kootenay. In the vicinity of Nelson, Revelstoke, Rossland, and 
Lardeau, in West Kootenay, and in East Kootenay in the Golden and Winder- 
mere divisions, the countr}' swarmed with prospectors and miners. The 
celebrated Hall mines, on Toad Mountain, near Nelson, was discovered in 
the fall of 1886, and located the following year. The Field mine was in 
operation in 1888. A location was made in Comaplix, in the Lardeau dis- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 281 

*-r-irL in the same year. The first claim recorded in the Rossland camp, was 
*n 1889. The Centre Star, War Eagle and Le Roi, were located in 1890, 
"nd in 1891 came the almost sensational discovery of the Slocan, which pro- 
'^«ced a boom in 1892, upon the top of which Kaslo came to the fore. Ross- 
'and and Trail were later developments. The Boundary district, though 
'blower of development, on account of the lack of railway facilities, which 
were not supplied until 1899, had its beginnings even earlier. In 1886-7, 
mineral was discovered and located near Boundary Falls, in Copper Camp. 
But it was not until the early nineties, that the properties that have become 
the chief producing factors — the Mother Lode, the Old Ironsides and Knob 
Hill claims — were staked. The North Star mine at Kimberly, in East 
Kootenay, was staked in 1892. We have also the Eugene group of claims 
on Moyie Lake, and the Sullivan group near Kimberly, which came into 
prominence about the same tim.e, and have been large producers. Fairview 
Camp, in the Yale district, was the scene of active operations over ten 
years ago, and a good deal of capital has been invested in development 
work and stamp mills. Important discoveries of copper-gold were made on 
Mount Sicker, in 1896 or 1897, and large developments followed, and two 
smelters. Prior to that, however, Texada Island began to attract attention, 
and in 1896 a small test shipment was sent out, and a smelter to treat the 
ores was erected in 1899. The Marble Bay mine, near the Van Anda, has 
been a regular shipper. The largest body of copper ore yet discovered any- 
where on the Coast, has been on the East shore of Howe Sound, and com- 
prises what is known as the Britannia group, officially described in the Min- 
ister of Mines report for 1900. Good properties were located on the Alberni 
Canal about ten years ago, and several fairly well-developed mines have been 
the result. 

It is impossible in brief space, to follow the course of mining develop- 
ment in the wide area of the province over which the prospector has travelled 
and staked. Important discoveries have been made at Quatsino, on the 



283 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Northwest coast of Vancouver Island, at various points up the Coast, as 
far as Windy Arm, at the boundary between Alaska and British Columbia; 
on the Skeena River, and in the Bulkley Valley; at Sooke and Coldstream, 
Vancouver Island; in the Pitt and Harrison River districts, on the Lower 
Mainland; in the Mount Baker district, near Chilliwack; on Burrard and 
Jervis inlets ; on several islands not mentioned ; in the Lillooet ; in the Fish 
River, Ferguson, Trout Lake, Poplar Creek camps, and elsewhere in the 
Lardeau district. Perhaps the most important district is in Yale county, 
included in what is known as the Similkameen. This section of the province 
has been delayed, owing to the lack of transportation. In Similkameen, 
there are many and extensive copper deposits, and at Hedley, a new mining 
camp, there is located a very promising gold property called the Nickel 
Plate, which has forty stamps in operation. From the various local mining 
centres, hurriedly indicated, the prospector has branched out and staked 
the country in many directions. 

Many small towns and incorporated cities (every incorporated town is 
classified as a city) have sprung up, following the course of mining devel- 
opment, each with a bright future predicted by its founders. Thus Kalso 
and Kamloops were incorporated in 1893 (Kamloops, however, was for a 
long time the urban centre of the Yale District) ; Nelson, Grand Forks, 
Greenwood and Rossland in 1897; Sandon in 1898, Phoenix in 1900, and 
Slocan and Trail in 1901. There are others such as Fernie and Revelstoke, 
which have been incorporated since that time; but there is a long list that 
are the direct creation of the mining industry, such as Ainsworth, Atlin, 
Comaplix, Crofton, Eholt, Elko, Ferguson, Fairview, Fort Steele, Hedley, 
Ladysmith, Michel, Morrisey, Moyie, New Denver, Quesnel Forks, Silverton, 
Three Forks, Trout Lake, Bullion, Camborne. Some of these are already in 
the " sere and yellow leaf," following the fortunes of the camps that gave 
them life and activity, but the majority are substantial and growing, while 
others are springing up.

Coal and Other Minerals. 
l"he history of coal mining is not less interesting than that of the other 
minerals. Already, a short sketch has been given of the very early opera- 
tions. The mines at Nanaimo and Departure Bay developed into extensive 
industries, finding their principal market in San Francisco. The Vancouver 
Coal Company, which was controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company, was 
subsequently reorganized in London, under the title of the New Vancouver 
Coal Company, which carried on operations for years. Recently their prop- 
erties were acquired by the Western Fuel Company, whose shareholders are 
American. The mines at Departure Bay are not now worked, and Welling- 
ton is now practically a deserted town. R. Dunsmuir &amp; Sons, the owners, 
have opened up a new and valuable mine, known as the Extension mine, 
in Cranberry district. The other well known mines, also operated by R. 
Dunsmuir &amp; Sons, are at Union, in the Comox Valley. The Union mines 
have shipped extensively for years. Coal exists in many parts of the province, 
— at Quatsino, on Queen Charlotte Islands, in the Northern Interior, in the 
.Similkameen and Nicola districts, and in the Crow's Nest Pass, but with the 
exception of the last named, have not been utilized. An interesting history 
is connected with the development of the coal fields of the Crow's Nest 
Pass. It dates back as far as 1887. In June of that year, Mr. William 
Fernie, then of Fort Steele, and Lieutenant-Colonel Baker, a member of the 
Provincial Legislature, decided to prospect the coal measures, the existence 
of which had been reported by Mr. Michael Phillipps, an old Hudson's Bay 
Company employee. Every summer, for eight or nine years, Mr. Fernie 
took men from Fort Steele to the Elk River district, where they prospected 
the coal seams outcropping there. A syndicate was formed in Victoria, to 
acquire and develop them. Eventually, a company was organized to take 
over the syndicate's holdings, and a charter from the Provincial Legislature 
obtained, authorizing the construction of the British Columbia Southern Rail- 
way, for which a land subsidy was obtained, to give access to this coal dis- 



284 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

trict. After a long series of negotiations, which forms a most imiwrtani 
chapter in the political history of this province and of Canada, an agree- 
ment was finally closed with the Canadian Pacific Railway, for the construc- 
tion of the railway through Crow's Nest Pass, to connect with its line at 
Lethhridge, in the Northwest Territory, thus affording direct connection be- 
tween the Eastern wholesale markets, and those of the Kootenay mininj^ 
towns. In the meanwhile, the Crow's Nest Pass Coal Company, controllea 
by Senator Cox, Robert Jaffray and other Eastern moneyed associates, ac- 
quired the coal lands, and have developed the mines, which are now produc- 
ing both coal and coke on a large scale. These mines, and the coking industry 
in connection, supply the smelters of the Interior with coke, which is largely 
shipped to the United States as well. To give an idea of the extent of 
these coal fields, their area is estimated by Dr. Dawson, to be about two 
hundred (200) square miles. For a portion of this area. Dr. Selwyn, for- 
merly director of the Geological Survey, estimates the coal underlying eaclr 
square mile to be 49,952,000 tons. Thus we have one of the most remarkable 
coal basins known. Assuming that the estimate of Dr. Selwyn holds good 
for half the area, and the production at 10,000 tons a day, the supply in 
sight is sufficient to last 500,000 years, quite long enough to relieve imme- 
diate posterity from the danger of a fuel famine. 

For the present, the output of coal is affected by the use of petroleum 
for fuel purposes, which is restricting the market, formerly enjoyed. The 
increasing use of coke in smelters, however, is in some measure compensating 
for the competition in oil fuel; and forever the coal measures of British 
Columbia must remain one of the greatest of provincial assets. 

There is not time or space to review all the mineral resources of the 
province. The next most important mineral, and it may prove eventually 
to be the most important, is iron. As yet, it has not taken on the same degree 
of economic importance as the other minerals reviewed, from the fact that 
the iron industry has not yet been established on this Coast, but prospects 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 285 

in that direction are visibly brighter. Iron ores in British Columbia are 
•widely, distributed throughout the Mainland and along the coast of both 
Island and Mainland. Although the Mainland has been but little prospected 
■for iron ores, extensive deposits are known to exist at Cherry Creek, near 
Kamloops; at Bull Creek, Gray Creek, and Kitchener (Goat River) in East 
Kootenay; and are reported in the mountains north of Trail and in the 
Cariboo district. On the Coast, iron deposits occur on Texada Island and 
adjacent islands, at Rivers Inlet, and' on Queen Charlotte Islands. The 
most important of these exist on the Island of Vancouver, at Sooke, Malahat 
Mountain, Port Renfrew (at the mouth of the San Juan River), Barkley 
Sound (including Sarita River and Cooper Island), Alberni Canal, Hesquoit 
Harbor, Nootka Sound and Quatsino Sound." As a rule, the iron ore is 
inagnetite in character, but deposits of Hematite hav6 been discovered at 
Quatsino, near Chemainu's, at Kitchener, and one or two other points, but not 
sufficient has been done to determine their extent or value. There is little 
doubt but that the bodiesofiroh, especially on the West Coast of ^Vancouver 
Island, are sufficiently extensive to maintain large blast furnaces ' for an 
indefinite time. - 

The conditions which affect the rtianufa^cture of iron on the Coast of 
British Columbia, are favorable in the extreme, if we except the^qii'estioh 
of market, which is yet an uhdeterfnihed factor. They are: cheap water', 
transportation, and' easy access to the water; good fuel at low* cost, with 
abundance of pure lime for fluxes. It is true that labor is higher on this 
Coast, biit the demand created by the existence of blast fuinaces, w'ould 
probably tend' to equalize conditions in that respect. The other favorable 
conditions, however, would tend to offset the price of labor, and place the in- 
dustry on a very favorable basis" as compared with other parts of the world! 

The other minerals, which are possessed in British Columbia in' suf- 
ficient quantity to be of importance econoniicallv, are zihc, associated prin- 
cipially with the silver-lead ores of the" Kootenay s'; cinnabar, the 'quicksilver- 



286 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

bearing zone, two miles wide, having been traced for thirty miles, crossing 
Kamloops Lake, about three miles above the lower end of it ; platinum, which 
occurs principally in the Tulameen, a branch of the Similkameen, and in the 
copper ores of Boundary and Rossland, and in the placers of Cariboo and 
Cassiar; mica, found in large quantities and excellent quality, in the vicinity 
of Tete Jeune Cache ; gypsum in the vicinity of Kamloops ; and lime in abun- 
dance in many parts of the province. Sulphur in the form of pyrites is more 
or less general; arsenic, osmiridium, scheelite and other minerals are also 
found. Tin, nickel, asbestos and manganese have not been reported to exist 
to any extent. 

It would be difficult to say which of the four main resources of the Prov- 
ince are the most important. Mining has by general consent been given the 
first place, and it will probably continue to occupy that place for some years 
to come, if not forever. The value and extent of the fisheries are as yet 
somewhat problematical, though it is doubtful even if fully developed, they 
would yield the same amount of wealth as the minerals of the Province. De- 
velopment in the case of the fisheries means depletion, unless means and 
methods are adopted to insure propagation on a scale commensurate with the 
fishing operations. There is great forest wealth on the Pacific Coast, but the 
timber is doomed to extinction along with that of the older parts of America. 
Up to the present time, no systematic or comprehensive system of protection 
and of forestration has been adopted, and without it, between the forest fires 
and the lumbermen, this capital resource will soon vanish. As yet, we have 
vast reserves, but with many loggers and mills at work, its disappearance will 
be much more rapid than the growth of new timber. The resource, however, 
upon which the highest permanent hopes may be based, is that of Agriculture 
in all its branches. We are told that the rainbow was placed in the sky as 
a token that as long as it remained there, there would be seedtime and harvest. 
It is morally certain that with rain and sunshine the industry, which is the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 287 

foundation of all industry and wealth, will continue unimpaired and perpetually 
productive. Owing to the potentialities of the soil and climate in British 
Columbia, the future of the Province is of the brightest possible character, and 
although the area of arable land is limited as compared with other provinces 
in Canada, it is not inconceivable that the output of the farms and orchards 
of British Columbia will yet be greater than that of the mines. Taking these 
resources in the order of their relative importance, as they appear at present 
from the value of the annual output, they are : 

Fisheries, 

There is a considerable variation in the value of the output of the fisheries 
from year to year. In 1901, which was the record year, owing to the large 
salmon pack, the yield of fisheries was estimated in value to be about $8,ckx&gt;,- 
000. The word " estimated " is used because outside of the salmon pack, 
there are no absolutely exact returns. In 1902, the value of the yield fell to 
$5,280,000. It is not proposed to go into a minute history of the fishing in- 
dustry in this Province. 

The salmon canning fishery, which has developed to such large propor- 
tions, practically began in the year 1876 on the Fraser River, New Westmin- 
ster District, The first pack amounted to almost 10,000 cases, which rapidly 
increased. The pack was 225,000 cases in 1883 ; 204,000 cases in 1887; 315,- 
000 cases in 189 1 ; over 1,000,000 cases in 1897, and over 1,236,000 cases 
in 1901. These were mainly big years. Statistics show, with more or less 
regularity, every fourth year to have been big years, followed by one or two lean 
years. The exact cause of this periodicity, which is peculiar to the Fraser 
River, has never been definitely ascertained. The development of the salmon 
fishing for commercial purposes was gradual at first, but proceeded more rap- 
idly in later years. It extended from the Fraser River to the Northern rivers 
and inlets, and we find canneries located at Rivers Inlet, Skeena and Naas 



288 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Rivers, Lowe Inlet, Dean Canal, Namu Harbor, Bella Coola, Smith's Inlet, 
Alert Bay, and on the West coast of Vancouver Island. 

Recently, presumably as a result of the numerous canneries operated 
and the catching of fish in traps by American fishermen before they 
reach the Fraser River,' there has been signs of depletion, and attention 
has been directed particularly to the increase of the natural supply by 
artificial methods of propagation, and by an endeavor to secure co-opera- 
tion with canneries operating on the American side, and uniformity of 
regulation with a view to prevention of destructive methods and perman- 
ent sources of supply. The cannerymen, both north and south of the 
boundary line fully appreciate the importance of this and undoubtedly in the 
near future a mutual understanding will be arrived at. The artificial propa- 
gation of salmon by means of hatcheries began in 1885. In 1902 the Prov- 
ince erected a large hatchery at Setori Lake, which last year had an output 
of over forty million of salmon fry. About the same time that the Province 
undertook artificial propagation, the Dominion Government began erecting 
other hatcheries, and there are now four operating on the Fraser River, Gran- 
ite Creek, Shuswap Lake, Skeena and Nimkish Rivers. 

A comparatively small trade is carried on in fresh, dry, salted and smoked 
salmon. The salmon most used for cannery purposes are the sockeye and co- 
hoes. The spring salmon and steelhead form the staple product for fresh 
fish export, while the dog salmon is now being utilized for the Japanese and 
other markets, in which a cheap product finds a demand. The fish next in 
importance to the salmon is the halibut, which is found in great quantities 
in Hecate Straits and along the coast to the northward. Within the last ten 
or twelve years, the halibut industry has developed into large proportions, and 
now over ten to fifteen million pounds is being shipped annually by the New 
England and other American companies, from Vancouver and Seattle, to the 
Eastern markets. 

The range of foot! fishes on this coast is not as wide as on the Atlantic, 







ft

f .\'l K 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 289 

but the quantity available in each is much larger. The prime food fishes out- 
side of the salmon and halibut referred to, are the oolachan, or candle fish, 
herring, sea bass, cod, sturgeon, shad, and a fish found in great quantities on 
the coast of Queen Charlotte Islands, known as black cod or " skill," some- 
what resembling the mackerel. The herring industry, recently inaugurated, 
promises to become important, as the herring run in immense numbers. Whale 
fishing has been inaugurated on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, and a 
guano factory has been established in connection. There are other fish, such 
as dog fish and sharks, which are utilized to some extent for their oil. The 
principal game fish in the Province is the trout, which is found in all the waters 
of British Columbia, and the spring or tyee salmon. Those who have paid 
attention to the fishery resources of the Province claim that there is a great 
future ahead, as soon as markets have been found. Considerable capital has 
been exj&gt;ended in experimental work in various processes in the curing of fish. 
So far it has not assumed large proportions. 

Forest Wealth. 

Turning now to the timber resources of the Province, it is rather hazard- 
ous to make an estimate of the amount of standing timber available for com- 
merce. No estimate can be regarded as reliable. Official publications give 
the timber area of British Columbia as i82,75o,ocx) acres, but a great deal of 
that, while timbered, is not commercially of use except for local purposes. 
Much of it is covered with small trees, only fit for fuel and mine timber. How- 
ever, it may be safely stated, that the largest and most important reserves of 
timber available on the North American continent for commercial purposes, 
are to be found in British Columbia. There are large detached limits of useful 
forest in the southern interior of the Province, now being utilized for export to 
the Northwest. This timber is much smaller than that found on the coast, 
where the trees grow to very large proportions; but still large as compared 
with that grown in the East. On coast limits as high as three hundred 



2U0 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

thousand feet of timber have been cut from one acre, but the best limits aver- 
age from twenty-five to fifty thousand feet. These are found on the lower 
Mainland, on Vancouver Island and the adjacant coast of the Mainland, and 
intervening islands as far north as the northern part of Vancouver Island, 
where the Douglas fir disappears. The principal timbers are the Douglas fir, 
which is the most important and widely distributed of the commercial trees, 
red cedar, spruce, western white pine, western yellow pine (or bull pine), hem- 
lock, western larch, and to a limited extent, yellow cedar. There are no de- 
ciduous trees of great commercial importance. Alder and maple are used in 
a limited way for finishing woods, but the supply is not large. There is some 
oak on the southern end of Vancouver Island, but of little use commercially. 
Cottonwood has been used for the manufacture of " excelsior," while arbutus, 
dogwood, buckthorn and crab apple have occasional special uses. It is pos- 
sible, however, to greatly diversify the useful hard woods of the Province, as 
walnut, butternut, hickory, elm, oak, beech, hard maples, ash, etc., can be culti- 
vated and grow rapidly. The utilization of spruce, hemlock and Douglas fir 
along the coast, for the manufacture of paper pulp, has had considerable atten- 
tion paid to it within the last few years, and several large companies have 
been organized with the purpose of engaging in the pulp and paper industries. 
Only preliminary work has yet been undertaken, but great hopes are enter- 
tained for the future. There are over one hundred saw mills in the Province, 
big and small, with a combined daily capacity of over two million feet, but 
this limit has never been reached; the annual cut running between three 
hundred to three hundred and fifty million feet. An important feature of the 
timber industry in recent years has been the manufacture of shingles from red 
cedar. 

A large market is found in the Northwest and Eastern Canada. With . 
the exception of the foreign export trade, amounting to about fifty million 
feet per annum, and a considerable local demand, the principal market for the 
timber of the mills of the Province is found in the Northwest provinces 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 291 

and Manitoba. For a long- period of years, the timber industry was in a de- 
pressed condition, but with the opening up of the Northwest, a new avenue of 
trade was found, and this market has been increasing in importance with 
the remarkable rush of population which has taken place recently, so that at 
present, the lumber industry is in a more prosperous condition than ever it 
was before. Timber lands have been in great demand, and new mills are being 
erected and old ones enlarged and modernized. 

Statistics of the timber and lumber industry are not available prior to 
the year 1888, when the reports of the Inspector of Forestry began to be pub- 
lished. Since that time a very complete annual statement has been included 
in the report of the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works. However, a 
careful estimate of the cut of timber in the Province since the commencement 
of the industry, made from available data in various years, gives the following 
results: To 1871, 250,000,000 feet; from 1871 to 1888, 595,000,000 feet; 
from 1888 to 1904, inclusive, 2,569,759,262 feet, or in the aggregate, 3,414,- 
759,262 feet. If we add to the above the amount of lumber manufactured on 
Dominion Government lands, and that cut from private lands concerning 
which there is no official record, the total will be very materially increased. 

Agriculture. 

Reference has already been made to the permanent character and bright 
possibilities of the agricultural industry in British Columbia. The achieve- 
ments in this direction for the past ten years are sufficient upon which to base 
the most sanguine anticipations. There are several elements which give great 
promise to the industry. The first is climate, which except in the most re- 
mote northerly parts of the Province, is conducive to the best results. On the 
Coast it is particularly mild and equable, and, therefore, favorable to small 
fruits, pears, plums, cherries, and several varieties of apples, to nearly all 
kinds of vegetables, for dairying and stock purposes, and to grain growing, 
with the exception of wheat, which does not ripen sufficiently hard for milling. 



292 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

In the interior valleys, where the heat is much greater in the summer time and 
the winters are dry and cold, the range of agricultural products in all lines 
is even greater because we have added to the fruits and grain already referred 
to those which require more heat and greater cold for maturing perfectly, for 
instance, it is possible to grow tomatoes, peaches and grapes, which require 
greatei" heat, and a greater variety of apples, which reach their perfection in a 
cold, rigorous climate. The finest of wheat for milling purposes can also be 
grown. The soil suitable for agriculture is everywhere very productive, and 
the yields on the average are greater than in any other part of Canada. This 
productiveness is a result of a combination of soil and climate. The growing 
season is long and conduces to the best quality. From a commercial point of 
view, the conditions are peculiarly favorable. The distance from Eastern 
Canada afifords a' natural protection in the way of freight rates, and the duty 
on agricultural products prevents over competition from the Pacific Coast 
states of America. The condition, however, which peculiarly favors fruit 
growing in British Columbia is the continuity of the Northwest Territory, 
now rapidly filling up with population. In addition to the home market, which 
is a large and profitable one and continuously growing, the fruit-grower has 
the Northwest practically to himself, and has heretofore been able to obtain 
the highest prices for all he could grow of the right varieties properly packed. 
The market, in fact, for fruit is increasing more rapidly than the ability of 
the fruit grower to supply it, and particularly in view of the expanding popula- 
tion, there need, therefore, be no anxiety for many years to come in regard to 
over production. 

There has always been, too, a large local demand for dairy products, poul- 
try and eggs, which the home product has been unable to fully supply. Farm- 
ers obtain the highest prices for their butter, eggs and poultry. With the ex- 
ception of the interior valleys — where stock growing has been carried on on a 
large scale, by being able to take advantage of the bunch grass ranges of the 
hill sides — British Columbia is not a country for large ranches ; all the condi- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 293 

tions are opposed to farming on a larg^e scale. Therefore, the agriculturist 
is, by virtue of such conditions, compelled to undertake mixed farming on a 
small scale, which, in the experience of the world, has proved to be the most 
profitable and most permanent. One of the conditions referred to is the cost 
of securing land and bringing it into cultivation, or if it be located in the dry 
belt, it requires irrigation, or if low-lying, demands extensive draining and 
under draining. In other words, taken as a whole, it is much more expensive 
to bring land under proper cultivation in British Columbia than in most other 
parts of America, and therefore not favorable to land holding in large areas, 
but once fitted for cultivation, it becomes by reason of a combination of favor- 
able circumstances, exceedingly productive, and yielding large dividends upon 
the capital invested. It is a country eminently suited to intensive cultivation 
of whatever character, and as at the present time fruit growing and dairying 
give promise of the greatest returns, particular attention is being paid to these 
branches of the industry. Within the past ten years no other industry of what- 
ever character has made such rapid and substantial progress as that of farm- 
ing, and no other has such bright prospects of continuous expansion and en- 
during success. It has not been usual in the past to regard British Columbia 
in the light of an agricultural country, and therefore it has become better 
known on account of its mineral, timber and fishing resources, but it is esti- 
mated that the value of farm products for 1905 was six million dollars. It 
will thus be seen that it compares favorably in agriculture with other natural 
resources. As an instance of the possibilities in this respect, the census of 
1 89 1 gives the extent of improved land at considerably less than half a million 
acres, and as a matter of fact, much of that is only partially improved. It 
would be safe to say that the area actually under cultivation does not exceed 
two hundred or two hundred and fifty thousand acres at the outside, so that 
the amount of arable land in the whole Province, the area of which is about 
two hundred and fifty million acres, is very small in comparison ; there is never- 
theless, sufficient to afford room for an agricultural population of half a mil- 



294 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

lion persons, allowing each farmer, or head of a family, ninety acres each, or 
at the present rate of production, capable of producing one hundred million 
dollars worth of farm produce annually. It is impossible at the present time, 
basing figiires upon official returns, to give an accurate estimate of the areas 
of the various arable districts of the Province, but in a rough way it is possible 
to give approximately the following: The lower Fraser valley in the West- 
minster district, 350,000 acres; the southeastern portion of Vancouver Island, 
250,000; the north end of Vancouver Island, 300,000 acres; Okanagan district, 
240,000 acres ; north and south Thompson River valleys, 75,000 acres ; Nicola, 
Similkameen, and Kettle River valleys, 350,000 acres; Lillooet and Cariboo, 
200,000 acres ; East and West Kootenay, 1 50,000 acres ; Canoe River valley, 
75,000 acres; the Chilcoten, including the Nechaco and Blackwater valleys, 
750,000 acres; Bulkley and Kispyox valleys, 200,000 acres; Ootsa Lake, 150,- 
• 000 acres; Bella Coola and other Coast districts, 150,000 acres; New Cale- 
donia, including Peace River, 5,500,000 acres; making a grand total of nearly 
9,000,000 acres. This is an estimate that cannot be verified officially, as but 
little is known as to the exact extent of some of the valleys enumerated, but 
it will probably be found to be not far wide of the mark. It will be seen that 
only a small percentage of this land has yet been made available, in fact, by far 
the largest part of it is still in the hands of the Government and until com- 
munication is effected, settlement and population must necessarily be slow. To 
show how rapidly the agricultural industry is developing, it may be stated that 
in 1897 the output of butter from the creameries did not exceed 75,000 pounds, 
whereas in 1904 there were about 1,120,000 pounds manufactured, with 
fourteen creameries in operation, showing an increase of 160,000 pounds 
over the previous year. 

The possibilities of further development is shown by the fact that in 1904 
considerably more butter was imported than was manufactured, or butter to 
the value of $1,180,000, which came from the Northwest, Oregon, Washing- 
ton, California, New Zealand and Australia. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 295 

The value of the fruit shipped in 1904 was estimated at $240,000, and 

the total value of the fruit produced and marketed exceeded $500,000, which 

amounts were largely exceeded in 1905, though returns are not available at 

the time of writing. The area of land planted in orchards, according to 

census returns of 1901, was 7,430 acres, the estimated value of the acreage of 

orchards planted in the three following years was 6,000 acres, so that at the 

end of 1904, there were about 13,500 acres of orchards, and it is estimated 

that in 1905, taking the number of trees planted as a basis, between 7,000 and 

10,000 acres of land was added to the area under cultivation, and devoted to 

fruit growing. 

Conclusion. 

The Province of British Columbia, though it has material and the natural 
conditions out of which to create great industries, has not yet been placed in 
the position in relation with the commercial world to take advantage of its 
opportunities. Development in that direction is a matter of slow progress, 
and follows in the wake of trade with the Orient, via the Pacific Ocean. Re- 
moteness from centers of supply, price of labor, the relatively high cost of 
transportation as compared with the Atlantic ports, and, in particular, with 
the great ports of Europe, with which the Pacific Coast must come into com- 
petition when striving for foreign trade, and other conditions, all enter into 
the problem of success, and have to be overcome by degrees. Trans-conti- 
nental railways and trans-Pacific stseamship lines and Pacific cable and the pro- 
posed Panama Canal, are altering the conditions, and we are gradually build- 
ing up Liverpools and New Yorks. It is, therefore, almost as certain as the 
sun rises in the east and sets in the west, that in time the center of commer- 
cial gravity will be shifted. We shall then stand in the same relative position 
in regard to the trade of the world as those world centers, and in point of in- 
dustry British Columbia will have exceptional advantages in relation to the 
Orient. The large industries which effect the international situation are iron 
and steel, pulp and paper, timber, fishery products, preserved and canned fruits 



296 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and vegetables, manufactured wcxjlens, etc. Respecting all of these and others 
that might be included, no country is in a better natural position to compete. 
It has not only geographical advantages by ocean navigation, but it has a great 
wealth of natural resouces easily accessible. It is indeed, in a much better 
position than Great Britain ever was, and the Mother Country until recently 
stood unrivalled in trade and industry. We may, therefore, look with un- 
bounded confidence, even though we have to exercise patience, to the future, 
when mammoth factories of various kinds will produce goods for every part 
of the globe, to be conveyed thither by fleets of steamers. Our ocean ports 
will be the entrepot for commerce flowing freely to and fro along the new route 
between the Occident and the Orient, and from the nether hemisphere of Aus- 
tralasia to the northern and congenerous parts of the same empire. Progress 
towards that end, as has already been remarked, has been extremely slow, and 
those in the early days who dreamed dreams of things we now see and have 
more certain knowledge of their approach, experienced many disappointments. 
They saw truly but too far ahead to reap of the harvest they had anticipated. 
In Hudson's Bay Company days there was a considerable trade carried on 
with points on the Pacific coast north and south, with the Sandwich Islands, 
China and Siberia, and of course, with Great Britain, from which all mer- 
chandise came. The Oregon territory then produced furs, wheat, lumber, 
meat and skins, flour, etc. This in a small way gave promise of things to 
come. After the organization of the colonies, subsequent to the first gold rush, 
there was little exported except gold, lumber and furs, which percolated 
through Victoria, principally from the northern and interior posts of the com- 
pany. For a number of years these were practically the only items of ex- 
port. Canned salmon did not enter the list until after 1876, while the exports 
of foreign lumber never materially increased from the early days. Practically 
everything important in the line of export trade is modern. 

To some extent, it may be said that British Columbia for years existed on 
prospects. The first gold rush produced an excitement and real estate booms 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 297 

in Victoria and New Westminster, followed by extreme depression, which 
was relieved by the second rush, the result of the Cariboo excitement and dis- 
coveries. Depression then became and remained chronic, with occasional 
spurts arising out of new finds and rushes here and there, or new developments 
in the political situation, promising union, or confederation, or the building 
oi the railway. It was only after the building of the Canadian Pacific Rail- 
way became a certainty and work actually began, that the business of the 
Province revived. Then inflation in real estate set in, the like of which Brit- 
ish Columbia never experienced. Business in every line revived, and specu- 
lation was greatly stimulated by the prospects. The movement grew in 
strength until about 1890, when it had attained its height, and had reached 
every inhabited part of the Province. Vancouver City was the center of the 
speculative whirl, but Victoria, New Westminster and many other places 
boomed out of all proportion to business actually being done. Speculation 
extended to timber limits, wild lands, farm lands, to mining properties, and 
even to the fisheries. After the climax had been reached there was a very 
rapid shrinkage in values, and in 1893, 1894 and 1895 the after effects were 
very severe. In 1896 matters began to improve and improvement may be 
said to have continued ever since, though mining, fishing and lumbering 
each has experienced ups and downs of a serious character, hard body blows 
from various quarters and for various reasons too long to explain. At the 
present time, the opening of the year 1906, the Province is in sound condition 
industrially and commercially, and enjoying general peace and prosperity, with 
prospects of railway construction and development that have not seemed so 
assured for many years. It may be that we shall be carried on the whirligig 
of fortune through past vicissitudes, and land in a position somewhat sim- 
ilar to what we were in 1893-6. The exercise of business discretion and wis- 
dom fraught of experience should steer us through the inevitable era of de- 
pression safely, and without the acute sufferings following reckless and un- 
warranted investments and business ventures. That period of reaction, how- 



298 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ever, is not likely to occur again for several years, and until after the Prov- 
ince has made tremendous strides forward and become the Mecca of the multi- 
tudes who are now looking to the boundless West for new homes and new 
careers. The movement, which is fast gathering force must exhaust itself 
before the clouds of adversity again appear on our horizon. That we shall 
have undue speculation and inflation, as a consequence of population overflow- 
ing the Rockies, is as certain as it is apparently unavoidable, but while those 
periods of great activity, like electrical storms, leave many business wrecks 
in their tracks, they also sow the seeds of new industries and suggest new 
possibilities. It will, at the worst, in the future be as it has been in the past. 
Each time when we sink low in the valley of depression we ascend higher 
mountains beyond, until some day we shall view the world at our feet.

On May 26, 1903, it was announced that Premier Prior had requested 
the resignation of Mr. Eberts and Mr. Wells. On May 27 Mr. Mclnnes 
resigned, in order, he explained, to facilitate an appeal to the country on 
party lines. The House re-assembled, after an adjournment of some weeks, 
May 27. The adjournment took place in order to afford a special committee 
opportunity to take evidence in regard to the Columbia and Western railway 
land grants, and the position of officials of the C. P. R. in that affair. When 
the House re-assembled, Premier Prior stated that he had formed the opinion 
that it was impossible for the Government to be carried on effectively with 



314 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

acute differences of opinion existing between its members. He had ac- 
quainted the Lieutenant-Governor with the situation, and had been promised' 
a dissolution as soon as the supplies had been voted. Subsequently the Pre- 
mier moved the adjournment of House, and the motion was voted down by 
17 to 14. A'fter discussion, a motion, by the Opposition, to adjourn was 
also voted down, and subsequently a motion to adjourn, made by the Premier, 
was agreed to. On May 28, Colonel Prior asked the House to vote the 
supplies necessary until the new House was elected. This request was re- 
fused by a vote of 19 to 16. Mr. Curtis moved for a committee to investi- 
gate a. newspaper charge that Colonel Prior had improperly secured a con- 
tract to his firm from a department of which he was at the time Acting Min- 
ister. He concurred in Mr. Curtis' motion. On the committee reporting 
the evidence, Col. Prior acknowledged that he had been indiscreet, but denied 
that he had been dishonest. 

On June i, the Lieutenant Governor dismissed the Prior Ministry and 
called on the Hon. Richard McBride to form a government, which he suc- 
ceeded in doing, as follows :

318 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

CAPTAIN HERBERT GEORGE LEWIS. 

Captain Herbert George Lewis is one of the very oldest living pioneers 
of the city of Victoria, and none can review a connection more intimate 
and direct with all this portion of the northwest coast than he. For con- 
siderably longer than a half century he has made Victoria and environs the 
center and scene of his life's activities, and nearly always in connection with 
the shipping and marine affairs. 

Captain Lewis was born in Aspeden, Hertfordshire, England, January 
2, 1828, and his family is of old English stock. He was educated in Chel- 
tenham College, at the time the great public school of western England, 
and his training was practical and thorough. When sixteen years old he 
began his career on the sea, and as a midshipman made several voyages from 
England to India and China. In 1847 he entered the service of the great 
Hudson's Bay Company, a corporation that had more extensive interests in 
the northwest than any other industrial enterprise, and its influence was the 
most powerful in building up towns and trade centers. In the service of 
this company he sailed to Victoria. At that early day Victoria existed only 
by virtue of the Hudson's Bay Company, and the fort and its extensive en- 
virons was all there was to the city. Young Lewis left the ship Cowlitz and 
on the Beaver went up to Fort Simpson, where he and the rest of the party 
had been only a short time when the news of the gold discovery in Califor- 
nia reached them. The mate of the ship and six of the sailors stole the 
ship's boat and started out for the diggings. Immediately on the discovery 
of the loss Mr. Lewis was appointed by the commander, Sir James Douglass, 
to take twelve men and set out in pursuit. His party kept along the shore 
of Puget Sound until they arrived at Olympia, which has since developed 
into the capital of Washington, but they failed to overhaul the deserters or 
recover the lost boat. He remained under the command of Sir James 
Douglass at Fort Simpson for some time. 

During his long career in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, 
Captain Lewis had command, at different times, of the Beaver, the Otter, 
the Labouchere, and he was engaged for a time in transporting wheat, furs 
and passengers between Sitka, in Russian Alaska, and Victoria. In 1858 
he carried passengers up the Eraser river to the gold diggings. While in 
command of the Labouchere and the Otter, he had charge of the fur trade 
in the Russian territory from 1864 until the acquisition of Alaska by the 
United States in 1867. In 1869 he made a visit back to England, and while 
still there in the following year, he was married to Miss Mary Langford.

the daughter of Edward Langford, who had come out to British Columbia 
in. 1852. After his marriage Captain Lewis returned to Victoria and con- 
tinued his connection with the Hudson's Bay Company until 1883. In that 
year he entered the Marine Department of Canada, and has continued in 
that line of public service to the present time. He has his office at the wharf 
on James bay, and his pleasant home is situated on the south side of the bay. 
Every day he crosses over to and from his office in his rowboat, and though 
in the seventy-sixth year of his age, he is still a man of remarkable vigor 
and attends to business and his active affairs with all the zest of his younger 
days. He is one of the old-time seamen of the northwest coast, and it is 
doubtful if anyone knows the Pacific coast better than he. 

Captain Lewis' happy married life extended over a period of thirty- 
three years, and it was a deep loss not only to himself but to his many friends 
when his wife was taken away by death on May 17, 1903. She was a mem- 
ber of the Church of England, and a lady of many estimable qualities, and 
her life was one of usefulness both at home and in the community. Captain 
Lewis has accumulated considerable property, at different places, in the course 
of his long career, and his last years are being spent in comfort and ease, 
although it is a source of happiness to him that he can still carry the active 
burdens of the world- and perform a useful part in the community. He and 
his family are members of the Church of England, and his fraternal affilia- 
tions are with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. 

LESLIE HILL. 

Leslie Hill, general manager for a mining syndicate of British Columbia 
with residence in Nelson, is classed today with the energetic and progressive 
business men of his locality. It is impossible to clearly determine what 
would be the condition of the province were it not for its splendid mining 
resources. Imbedded beneath the earth's surface are the rich mineral prod- 
ucts awaiting the efforts of those who can convert these products into a 
marketable commodity for use in the commercial world. With this impor- 
tant task Mr. Hill has been closely associated for a number of years,, having 
a thorough knowledge, of the great scientific principles which underlie min- 
ing processes as well as the practical work of spreading the ore and placing 
it in condition where it may be used in manufactures. 

Born in England, Mr, Hill prepared for the profession of civil engin- 
eering. He worked with Thomas J. Bewick in Northumberland county, 
England, in the lead mining districts, going there to perfect his knowledge 



320 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of his chosen caUing. Crossing- the Atlantic to the new world he was man- 
ager of the Capleton Copper Company, of Quebec, in 1876. In 1878 he 
accepted a position as engineer and manager of the San Pete Coal &amp; Coke 
Company, of Utah, and in 1880 he went to Montana, where he became a con- 
sulting engineer, acting in that capacity until 1890. Two years later he went 
to Golden, British Columbia, and as a consulting engineer made the first 
report on the North Star mine. In 1893 the mine was shut down and he 
then joined the Prospecting Syndicate of British Columbia as engineer and 
purchased the Jewell mine for the syndicate near Greenwood. He took the 
first hoist into that country and did the first regular work there. He was 
with the syndicate some years and also did consulting work. Until 1902 
his headquarters were in Vancouver, but in that year he joined the Hast- 
ings Syndicate and came to Nelson, being now general manager of the 
properties controlled by that syndicate. His intimate knowledge of civil 
engineering and of mining makes him well qualified for the important duties 
which devolve upon him and his efforts are of direct benefit to the locality 
as well as a source of individual profit from the fact that every new and 
successful enterprise adds to the commercial and industrial activity of a 
community and it is upon such activity that the welfare and upbuilding of 
each district depends. He has good business ability and executive efforts, 
is far-sighted and enterprising and his labors have enabled him to win a 
prominent position in connection with the mining interests of the great 
northwest. 

HON. ALEXANDER R. ROBERTSON. 

Hon. Alexander Rocke Robertson was for many years a conspicuous 
figure in the legislative and judicial history of the province, where from 
pioneer days up to the time of his death he made his home, bringing his 
strong intellectuality to bear upon many questions affecting the national wel- 
fare. The public life of few other illustrious citizens of British Columbia 
has extended over so long a period as his, and certainly the life of none has 
been more varied in service, more fearless in conduct and more stainless in 
reputation. His career was one of activity, full of incidents and results. In 
every sphere of life in which he was called upon to move he made an indeli- 
ble impression and by his upright public service he honored those who hon- 
ored him with official preferment. 

Alexander R. RolDertson was born in Chatham, Ontario, in 1840, and 
came to British Columbia in 1864. He had acquired a liberal law educa- 
tion and practiced his profession successfully. The zeal with which he 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 321 

devoted his energies to his chosen hfe work, the careful regard evinced for 
the interests of his clients and an assiduous and unrelaxing attention to all 
the details of his cases, brought him a large clientage and made him very 
successful in his legal business both as advocate and counsellor. The emi- 
nence which he won as a practitioner ultimately led to his elevation to the 
su]&gt;reme court bench of the province, and yet it was not alone through his 
connection with the bar that he won distinction and was regarded as one 
of the valued citizens of Victoria. He contributed to the moral progress of 
the city through his membership in the Church of England and aside from 
his connection with the various church activities he also served as Sunday- 
school superintendent for many years. He was a member of the first pro- 
vincial legislature, secretary of the first government of the confederation 
and also served for some time as mayor of the city. 

Mr. Robertson married Miss Margaret Bruce Eberts, the eldest daugh- 
ter of the late W. D. Eberts, of Chatham, Ontario. They were the parents 
of seven children, five of whom are living, namely : Herbert, a lawyer, resid- 
ing in Dawson; Harold B., a practicing attorney of Victoria; Herman M., 
a practicing physician of Victoria, who was born in this city in 1876, studied 
medicine and received his degree when in his twenty-first year and began 
practicing in 1898, since which time he has enjoyed a lucrative patronage 
in hi.s native city, where he is also serving as health officer and as secretary 
of the Victoria Medical Association; Tate M., who is engaged in business 
in New Orleans; and Alexander, who has just completed his education in 
McGill University, at Montreal, Canada. The family are Episcopalians in 
religious faith and stand very high in the esteem of all who know them. Dr. 
Robertson is a Royal Arch Mason and also belongs to the Knights of Pythias 
fraternity and the Sons of Scotland. His mother is still living in the com- 
fortable family residence in Victoria, to which city she came in her early 
married life. Mr. Robertson died December i, 1881. While he attained 
eminence in his profession his labors were not restricted to the advance- 
ment of his own personal interests. He extended his efforts to various fields, 
in which, as an acknowledged leader, . he championed the highest interests 
of the municipality and of the people at large, and with such success that 
his name came to be held in high honor while he lived and his untimely 
death was regarded with a sorrow which was at once general and sincere.

A. E. McPHILLIPS, K. C. 

A. E. McPhillips, K. C, an active member of the Victoria bar and at * 
one time attorney general of British Columbia, was born on the 21st of 
March, 1861, at Richmond Hill, a few miles north of the city of Toronto. 
The family is of Irish origin, the McPhillips family of the county Mayo, Ire- 
land. His father, George McPhillips, C. E., emigrated from Ireland to 
Canada in 1840, and practiced his profession first in the state of New York, 
and afterwards in the provinnce of Ontario. For years he was a Dominion 
land surveyor and civil engineer, and was well known throughout Canada. 
On the outbreak of the first Riel rebellion in 1870 he followed Colonel Gar- 
net Wolsley, now Lord Wolsley, who was in command of the Red River 
expedition, to Manitoba, and had under his charge the first Canadian money 
and coinage forwarded by the Dominion government to the Provincial gov- 
ernment of Manitoba, amounting to one hundred thousand dollars. Sub- 
sequently he had charge of the settlement belt or river surveys for the 
Dominion government. He died in Winnipeg in 1878. His wife bore 
the maiden name of Margaret Lavin, and was also a native of Ireland. 

In 1873 the family located in Manitoba and A. E. McPhillips, then a 
lad of twelve years, was sent to the well known Catholic College of St. Boni- 
face, and later to Manitoba College, at Winnipeg, where he was graduated 
with the class of 1879. Deciding to adopt the profession of law as a life 
work, he entered, as a student, the office of Messrs. Biggs &amp; Wood, of 
which the Hon. S. C. Biggs, K. C, now of Toronto, was the senior mem- 
ber. He was called to the bar of Manitoba in Trinity Term, 1882, and en- 
tered upon the practice of his chosen profession in partnership with his 
brother, L. G. McPhillips, who is now a king's counsel and the senior mem- 
ber of the firm of McPhillips &amp; Lawssen, of Vancouver. 

A. E. McPhillips removed to Victoria, British Columbia, and was 
called to the bar of this province, practicing alone for a few months, when 
the firm of McPhillips, Wootton &amp; Barnard was formed, which was dissolved 
on the 1st of November, 1904. He now leads the firm of McPhillips &amp; 
Heisterman. The firm has made a special feature of corporation law and 
Mr. McPhillips is counsel for the Imperial Bank of Canada, at Victoria, and 
liis firm are the solicitors for the British Columbia Electric Railway Com- 
pany, Limited, which operates lines at Victoria, Vancouver and New West- 
minster, the British Columbia Land and Investment Agency, Limited, the 
British Columbia Telephones Company, and various other corporations. 

From 1896 until 1901, inclusive, Mr. McPhillips was vice president of 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 323 

the Union Club of Victoria, and in 1902-3 acted as its president. Interested 
in military matters, he has a second class military certificate from the Toronto 
School of Infantry and on the outbreak of the Northwest rebellion in 1885, 
he was a lieutenant in the Nineteenth Battalion, Winnipeg Rifles, with which 
regiment he served at the front through the campaign and was in the engage- 
ments of Fish Creek and Batoche, and now holds a medal and clasp. In 1890 
he retired from the regiment with the rank of captain. 

In Dominion politics Mr. McPhillips has always been a Conservative, 
and in 1896, during the controversy over the Manitoba school question, he 
wrote some very valuable articles setting forth the Roman Catholic point of 
view — articles that had no little effect upon the public mind. In 1898 he was 
elected to the British Columbia Legislature from Victoria as a supporter of 
the ministry of the Hon. J. H. Turner, and was re-elected in 1900, which 
election was a public endorsement of his former efficient service. He was 
always regarded as one of the ablest and most progressive members of the 
provincial parliament, being one of the principal members of the opposition 
under the leadership of Richard McBride, the present premier. It was 
through the appointment of Hon. McBride that Mr. McPhillips became at- 
torney general of the province, a position which he filled until the 5th of 
November, 1903, when he resigned. His activity in community and pro- 
vincial affairs has ever been prompted by a most public-spirited interest in the 
general welfare. 

Mr. McPhillips was married in 1896 to Miss Sophie Davie, a daughter 
of the late Alexander Davie, K. C, of Victoria, who was premier and attorney 
general of British Columbia at the time of his death, in 1889. Mr. and Mrs. 
McPhillips have three children. They are members of the Roman Catholic 
church, and " Clonmore House," their beautiful residence on Rockland 
avenue, is the center of a cultured society circle. 

Standing today as one of the leading members of the Victoria bar, with 
a knowledge of the law and a resource in practice that makes him a formidable 
adversary in the courtroom and a wise counsellor, he has at the same time been 
a director of public thought and opinion, while his personal worth has won him 
warm friendships and high regard. 

HON. W. J. ARMSTRONG. 

Hon. William James Armstrong, who has now passed the seventy- 
eighth milestone on life's journey and for forty-six years has been a resi- 
dent of British Columbia, has been closely associated with the development 



324 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of the material resources of the country and at the same time has figured 
prominently in its public life, wielding a wide influence and becoming a 
director of public thought and action. His course has always been charac- 
terized by devotion to the general good rather than to personal advance- 
ment, and he has placed the welfare of the province before partisanship or 
self-aggrandizement, and thus throughout his public life he has honored the 
people who have honored him with high political preferment and distinc- 
tion. 

Mr. Armstrong has the credit of being the first settler in New West- 
minster and built the first house in what is now the Royal City by the Grand 
Eraser river. He is a native of Peterborough, Ontario, born on the 31st 
of October, 1826, and is of Scotch descent. His grandfather, Mathew 
Armstrong, was born in county Cavan, Ireland, and emigrating to Canada 
in 1814, became the pioneer settler of the township of Cavan, in Ontario; 
in fact, he gave the name to the township. 

William Armstrong, father of W. J. Armstrong, was bom in Ireland 
in 1800 and came with his father to Canada when fourteen years of age. 
He married Miss Elizabeth Brown, a native of county Cavan, Ireland, with 
whom he afterward came to the Pacific coast. He was a merchant and a 
farmer, and while in Canada also became active in military and civic affairs, 
serving as captain of militia and as magistrate for many years, his public 
duties being always most faithfully performed. He was likewise active in 
church work in Canada, he and his wife being mernbers of the Episcopal 
church, to the support of which he contributed generously, while in all possi- 
ble ways he aided in the extension of its influence. In 185 1 he emigrated 
with his family to Grass Valley, California, and was one of the pioneers of 
that state, contributing to its early substantial development. Pie went there 
in search of a milder climate, and after many years of active business life 
he lived retired. His wife died many years before and there was a second 
marriage, and several children by that union. He attained the venerable 
age of ninety-four years and at his demise left to his family an untarnished 
name. There were six children by the first marriage, of whom only twO' are 
now living: Mrs. James Stratton, a resident of Peterborough, Ontario; and 
William J., of this review. 

The latter attended the comnTOn schools of Ontario, but is practically 
a self-educated as well as self-made man. • He went with his father and the 
family to California in 185 1 and engaged in placer mining in Grass Valley, 
on Iowa Hill, meeting with only moderate success. He worked for wages 
and continued in California until 1858, when he removed to British Colum- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 325 

bia, taking up his residence at Langley. The work of settlement of a per- 
manent character had scarcely been begun, although the rich mineral dis- 
tricts of the country had drawn many men to this region in search of gold. 
Colonel Moody had decided upon what is now New Westminster as the 
site of a capital for the colony and it was called Queensborough. In March, 
1859, Mr. Armstrong and his half-brother, Henry Armstrong, together 
with John S. McDonald, came down the river to the new townsite. There 
had been an effort to start a town some distance up the river, to be called 
Derby, but it had been given up. A schooner, loaded with lumber, was 
making its way up the river intending to take its cargo, but when it was 
learned that that town had been abandoned it unloaded its lumber at Queens- 
borough and from some of this lumber the first house of what is now New 
Westminster was erected by Mr. Armstrong, assisted by his friends who 
were with him. He opened a little general mercantile store and therefore 
has the honor of being the first merchant of the city as well as the owner 
of its first residence. The first stock of goods for the store was secured in 
Victoria and he continued in the trade until 1873. ^^ was long prominent 
in its business life and thus contributed in large measure to the commercial 
activity of the city, upon which the prosperity and well-being of every com- 
munity always depends. 

Mr. Armstrong has also figured prominently in public affairs, aiding 
in molding public thought and action, and his influence has ever had a 
beneficial effect upon his community and province. In i860, when the first 
town council was elected, he was chosen one of the councilmen and re- 
mained an active member of that body until 1873. In 1869 he was chosen 
its president and also in 1870. He became very active in securing federa- 
tion, and after this was accomplished he was elected to represent the dis- 
trict of Westminster in the provincial legislature. In 1873, when the 
McCreight government was defeated by the DeCosmos government, he joined 
the cabinet of the latter as minister of finance and agriculture and retained 
that office until 1876, when his party was defeated. He continued an active 
worker an the opposition benches until 1879. During the session of that 
year a deadlock occurred and the government was about to appeal to the 
country without having passed the estimates. Mr. Armstrong, understand- 
ing the financial situation and seeing the effect it would have on the provincial 
credit, arranged a meeting between three representatives from each party 
and secured an understanding whereby supplies were voted for the con- 
duct of public business. In the general election of 1897 Mr. Armstrong 
stood as a candidate for Ne^v Westminster, but was defeated, largely be- 



326 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

cause of his inability to make a personal canvass, owing to the demands 
upon his time made by his extensive business interests. 

In the bi-election of 1881 Mr. Armstrong again offered himself as a 
candidate for his city and was elected by an overwhelming majority. To- 
ward the close of this session he became provincial secretary. In the gen- 
eral election of 1882 he was again returned as representative from New 
Westminster, but his party was in the minority in the house and he took his 
seat on the opposition benches. In 1883 he was appointed sheriff of West- 
minster county and the house thus lost one of its most able and energetic 
working members — one who looked more tO' the interests of the county than 
to the interests of the party. He has had much to do with the legislature of 
the province, as well as with the management of its finances for eleven years, 
and after his retirement was often urged to again stand for the dominion 
and provincial legislatures, but declined to again enter public life. 

In the years in which he figured prominently and beneficially in public 
affairs, Mr. Armstrong capably managed private business interests. In 1867, 
at Westminster, he built a flour mill, which was the first in the province, and 
continued its operation until 1871. In 1876 he built a sawmill, which he 
continued to conduct until 1882. He has had much to do with most of the 
enterprises which, since i860 have been the principal features in the upbuild- 
ing and development of the county, and his labors have had direct and imr 
portant effect on material upbuilding and political progress. He was ap- 
pointed and has filled the office of justice of the peace for many years. When 
he had served as sheriff for ten years he resigned in favor of his son, who 
has since filled that office. 

In 1 86 1 Mr. Armstrong was married to Miss H. C. Ladner, a native 
of Cornwall, England. This union has been blessed with three daughters 
and three sons, as follows : Sarah Frances, at home ; William Thomas ; 
Joseph, now sheriff of the county; Rosanna Salina, now the wife of Dr. O. 
Morris, a practicing physician of Vernon; and two who died in childhood. 
Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are valued members of the Episcopal church, of 
which he has been an officer for many years, and was one of the men who 
aided in the building of the church edifice. He has for years been president 
of the Westminster branch of the British Columbia and Foreign Bible So- 
ciety, and has labored with strong purpose for the moral progress of his 
county. Through a long period he has been identified with the Independent 
Order of Odd Fellows and served as the first noble grand in New Westmin- 
ster. 

Mr. Armstrong, having promised his wife that when the railroad was 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 327 

built through this city they would take a trip to the east, ten days after the 
trains began running they and their two daughters started for Quebec, visiting 
also Niagara Falls, Chicago. St. Paul and Winnipeg, having a delightful four 
months' excursion by rail and seeing many points of interest in Canada and 
the States. They have an attractive home in New Westminster, and this 
honored pioneer, the first permanent settler here, receives the respect and 
veneration which should ever be accorded those who travel far on life's jour- 
ney and whose course has been marked by good deeds and strong and honora- 
ble purpose. His name has long been a synonym for business and political in- 
tegrity and his record forms an integral chapter in the history of British 
Columbia. 

GEORGE LAWSON MILNE, M. D., J. P. 

George Lawson Milne, M. D., an ex-member of the provincial parlia- 
ment, for the past quarter of a century a prominent medical practitioner in 
Victoria, and also a leader in business circles and closely identified with public 
affairs, has put his talents to use in many ways for his own advancement and 
for the advantage of his province and his fellow men. 

He is a Scotchman by birth, having been born in the town of Garmouth, 
Morayshire, April 19, 1850. His ancestral line goes back many generations 
in Scotland. His parents were Alexander and Isabella (Ingils) Milne, both 
natives of that country. The Milnes were very prominent Scotch Presbyter- 
ians, and Dr. Milne's father was an elder and a deacon after the disruption of 
the church in 1845. The father followed merchandising in the old country, 
and in 1857 emigrated to Ontario, dying in Meaford in that province, when in 
the eighty-fourth year of his life. A successful business man and merchant, 
he was likewise everywhere honored for his probity of character and useful- 
ness in church and society. His wife died at the age of seventy- four years, 
and they had been the parents of eleven children, six sons and five daughters. 
The oldest son, the late Alexander Milne, C. M. G., was for many years col- 
lector of customs in Victoria, and his death occurred on the 17th of January, 
1904. 

Dr. Milne is now the only member of the family in the province of Brit- 
ish Columbia. He was seven years old when brought across the waters to 
Canada, and he was reared and received his early education at Meaford. He 
later took up the study of medicine, receiving the degree of M. D. from the 
Toronto University and the degree of M. D. C. M. from the Victoria Univer- 
sity, after which he immediately entered upon the practice of his profession. 
He has gained an enviable reputation in his work, and has a profitable prac- 



328 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

tice. He was health officer for the city of Victoria from 1886 to 1892, dur- 
ing which time he took a hvely interest in the question of a proper sewage 
system, and has written several able articles on the " Separate System of 
Sewage," also an article on " Modified Typhoid Fever," besides other subjects. 

During his residence in Victoria he has been especially interested in 
public affairs. For the advancement of the cause of education he served 
for a number of years on the school board, and the school system of the city 
has been effectively aided by him. He was among the first to take steps look- 
ing to providing a new medical act for the province, and since the organiza- 
tion of the medical council he was registrar and secretary for many years, 
as well as a medical examiner for that body. Dr. Milne's political alignment 
has always been with the Liberals, and he represented the city of Victoria in 
the local legislature from 1900 to 1904. In 1896 he contested, but unsuccess- 
fully, the constituency of Victoria city and district for the Dominion house 
of parliament. At present Dr. Milne is medical inspector and immigration 
agent at Victoria for the Dominion government, and is a justice of the peace 
in and for the province of British Columbia. 

Dr. Milne has been a valuable factor in business affairs, notwithstanding 
his activity in professional work. It is to his credit that the Vancouver Gas 
Company was instituted, and he served as president of the company for some 
years. He is a director and president of the Nanaimo Gas Company. He 
is president of the Ramsey Brothers and Company, biscuit and candy manu- 
facturers, whose large factory is located at Vancouver, and is also a director 
of the National Life Assurance Company of Canada, with head office in To- 
ronto, Canada. For a number of years he was president of the Liberal Asso- 
ciation of Victoria. Dr. Milne is a prominent Mason, and has taken the blue 
lodge, the Royal Arch and Knight Templar degrees, and is also a member of 
the Independent Order of Foresters. His church connections are with the 
St. Andrew's Presbyterian church, of which he is a valued member. 

Dr. Milne was married in 1882 to Miss Ellen Catherine Kinsman, who 
is a native of Victoria and a daughter of Alderman John Kinsman, of that 
city. The Milne home is one of the most delightful in Victoria ; it is known 
as " Pinehurst," located on the Dallas road, and its beauty and charm are 
appreciated by scores of friends. 

JAMES YATES. 

James Yates, a prominent Victoria pioneer of 1849, "^^^ contributed to 
the early development of the city and aided in shaping the public policy to 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 329 

the betterment of conditions, material, intellectual and political, in the prov- 
ince, was born in Linlithgow, Scotland, on the 21st of January, 1819. He 
was reared and educated in his native country and was there married to Miss 
Mary Powell. In early life he had learned the trade of a ship carpenter and 
he came to British Columbia in 1849 to superintend the building of the Hud- 
son Bay ships, having an agreement whereby he was. to remain in charge of 
this work for three years. He was stationed at Victoria for eighteen months, 
at the end of which time he applied for a termination of the business arrange- 
ment with the Hudson's Bay Company. This was granted and he then 
opened a store of his own in which he sold goods and bought furs. He also 
invested in city property and became the owner of all of the land extending 
between Langley and Wharf streets, and Yates street, in this district, was 
named in his honor. Recognizing and taking advantage of existing busi- 
ness possibilities he made money rapidly, accumulating a handsome fortune 
during his sojourn in British Columbia. In 1855 he was elected to the first 
legislative council of Vancouver Island to represent Victoria city. In i860 
he returned to Scotland, taking his family with him and leaving them in 
that country in order to provide his children with better educational ad- 
vantages than could be secured in the province. He, however, returned to 
British Columbia in 1862 and it required two years for him to settle up his 
business. In 1864 he returned to his native land, where he spent his re- 
maining days, departing this life on the 23d of February, 1900, when in the 
eighty-first year of his age. His wife had died about a year prior to his 
demise. They were the parents of six children, as follows : Emma, who 
became the wife of Hon. Alexander McGregor, British consul in Stockholm, 
Sweden; Harriet, who became the wife of Professor G. S. Woodard, a pro- 
fessor of Pathology in the University of Cambridge; Mary, who is now Mrs. 
Harper, of Edinburgh, Scotland; Henry Myers and Catherine Jane, residing 
in Edinburgh, and James Stuart. 

The last named was born in Victoria, in 1857, ^^"^^ i^^ 1^62 he started 
with the family for Scotland. While in New York, at the St. Denis Hotel, 
he came very nearly losing his life by falling several stories down the well 
of a circular staircase. Both of his legs were broken and the New . York 
physician said he could not recover, but his father took him to Liverpool and 
placed him under the care of an eminent surgeon. Dr. Evan Thomas, and in 
three months he had recovered. He then joined the family in Scotland, 
where he acquired his education, attending the Edinburgh Collegiate School 
and the University of Edinburgh, being graduated in the latter institution 
with the degrees of Master of Arts, and Bachelor of Laws. He then entered 



330 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Middle Temple, London, England, as a law student and passed the required 
examination for admission to the bar in the Hilary term in 1883. 

After traveling through Denmark Mr. Yates came again to British 
Columbia, arriving in Victoria in the month of October, 1883, and here he 
embarked in the practice of his profession in connection with George Jay. 
Edwin Johnson, a well known barrister of Victoria, was absent in England 
for a year and they managed his business and upon his return the law firm of 
Johnson, Yates &amp; Jay was organized, this relationship being continued until 
1888, when Mr. Johnson withdrew, retiring from the practice of law. Since 
that time the firm of Yates &amp; Jay has maintained a continuous existence, with 
a remunerative general law practice. 

In his political views Mr. Yates is a Liberal. He was elected and served 
as one of the aldermen of the city in 1900, and was afterward re-elected by 
acclamation. He had the honor of being elected altogether four times and 
was the head and front of the controversy concerning the construction of the 
Point Ellis bridge, and had his views been carried out at that tmie eighteen 
thousand dollars would have been saved to the city. Mr, Yates was prom- 
inent in the organization of the Native Sons of British Columbia and had 
the honor of being elected its first chief factor. He was for many years a 
director of the Royal hospital and was also a director of the Provincial Jubi- 
lee from its inception. He served as a member of the Victoria school board 
for four years, during which time the north and south ward schoolhouses 
were built. He was a member of the Hon. Jo Martin government, and under 
Mr. Martin he served as chief commissioner of lands and works. Thus his 
activities have touched many lines bearing upon public progress and the bet- 
terment of conditions, educational and otherwise, in Victoria and the province, 
and he is widely and favorably known for his public-spirited citizenship. 

In 1890 Mr. Yates was happily married to Miss Annie Austin, a native 
of Victoria, and they now have three sons : James Austin, Henry Joel and 
Robert Stanley. The family are highly esteemed, and socially as well as 
professionally Mr. Yates is prominent. 

JAMES WELTON HORNE. 
James Welton Home, one of the most honored and prominent residents 
of the city of Vancouver, his life history forming an important chapter in its 
history, is the eldest son of Christopher and Elizabeth Harriet (Orr) Home, 
who were of Scotch and English ancestry. His birth occurred in the city of 
Toronto, Canada, on the 3d of November, 1853, and he there acquired his 
early education. He afterward attended school in Whitby and completed 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 33i 

his studies in the college at Belleville, Ontario. Thus equipped for life's prac- 
tical and resix)nsible duties he entered the office of the Stathacona Fire Insur- 
ance Company as assistant secretary, and at the end of a year began business 
on his own account as a financial, real estate and insurance broker. He suc- 
ceeded in securing a large clientage within three years, but Horace Greeley's 
advice, " Go west, young man, go west," was continually in his mind like a 
refrain. He was studying the signs of the times when the west was just 
being opened up to civilization for it afforded excellent natural resources 
and business opportunities and when there w^ere great possibilities for a young 
man of energy and enterprise. Subsequently in the spring of 1878 he re- 
moved to Winnipeg, w^here he again opened an office as a financial, real estate 
and insurance broker. Almost immediately he acquired a large and remu- 
nerative business there, but he was continually seeking broader fields of labor, 
and in March, 1881, when the Canadian Pacific Railway Company completed 
its arrangement with the Dominion government to build the line west from 
Winnipeg, Mr. Home at once determined to again act upon Horace Greeley's 
advice. There were hundreds of people on the qui vive to be the first on the 
site of the new town which was expected to spring up on the line of the road 
in the center of a fine agricultural country west of Winnipeg. Mr. Home 
concluded that he would be the first on the site, and when General Rosser laid 
out the road for the railroad Mr. Horne followed him on horseback. When 
he reached the point on the Assiniboyne river where it was necessary for 
the Canadian Pacific Railroad to cross he decided that he had found the site 
of the future town. Three reasons seemed to confirm his opinion. It was at 
the head of navigation on the Assiniboyne ; it was the center of a magnificent 
agricultural district, and it was sufficiently distant from Winnipeg, and would 
if once started attract the people in Winnipeg. The site of the future town 
was at that time undistinguishable from the prairie which surrounded it on 
every side, save that the great stakes of the railroad had been there driven. 
Mr. Horne purchased a portion of land at this point, at once put up a tent on 
the prairie and subdivided his land into town lots. He also opened and 
graded a street and when this was done began the erection of buildings, it 
being his intention to attract residents to the new^ tow^n. He then returned to 
Winnipeg and influenced a few of the business men to take his stores free of 
rent and establish different lines of commercial enterprises at that place, thus 
casting in their fortunes with the embryo city. His plan worked well for 
every new business and every additional citizen attracted others, so that the 
town became advertised, people talked about it and the settlers visited it to 
become permanent residents. The government land agent was induced by 



332 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. Home to make his headquarters there and thus the first office building 
was located at that point. Mr. Home secured the establishment of a post- 
office and the papers began to comment upon the new western town, its 
growth and possibilities, and in the autumn of the first year it had between 
two and three hundred inhabitants. The future of Brandon — for so it was 
called — was thus assured. Mr. Home continued to erect buildings on his 
property and Rosser avenue, the street on which they were built, became the 
principal thoroughfare. In November the railroad reached the place and with 
it a large number of people poured in. In the spring of 1882 there were 
over one thousand inhabitants in Brandon, a public meeting was called, a city 
charter was applied for and granted and Mr. Home allowed himself to be 
elected a member of the council board, believing that he could accomplish 
much in that position. At the first meeting of the board he was elected 
chairman of the board of public v\^rks and in that capacity he brought in a 
report recommending the opening of streets, the building of sidewalks and 
other city improvements which would cost one hundred and fifty thousand 
dollars. The recommendation was adopted and the work of carrying out the 
details was left to him. He at once advertised for workers in the principal 
papers in the east and the attention of contractors and workers was thus 
turned to Brandon and a large number of people came, so that at the end of 
the year its population had reached three thousand. Mr. Home was also 
instrumental in securing the establishment of public institutions here, a land 
register office was located in the young city and the office of registrar was 
tendered to him, but he declined it. His property increased in value with the 
growth of the town and he was regarded as a most enterprising and success- 
ful business man. 

The work of city building here having been carefully instituted and 
placed upon a safe basis Mr. Home then sought other fields of activity. He 
had always kept a watchful eye upon the Pacific province and was especially 
interested in the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In the spring of 
1883 he took a trip to southern California and on his return visited Burrard 
inlet and the Fraser river. He perceived, however, that he was too early to 
do permanent work in that locality and returned to Winnipeg and Brandon 
to settle up his business affairs there. In the spring of 1884, however, he 
again visited Burrard inlet, but found that the terminus had not yet been 
definitely settled. In March, 1885, he finally located at Coal Harbor, now 
the city of Vancouver, this being a year and ten months before the railroad 
was extended to the city. He invested largely in real estate when there was 
little to indicate the present phenomenal metropolis except a fev/ board shan-

ties scattered along the beach. At this early stage in the city's history, when 
it existed only on paper, he identified himself with its progress and growth. 
Possessing keen discrimination ahd sagacity he made very choice locations 
of property and erected business buildings thereon. His faith in Vancouver 
and its possibilities was from the first unbounded and time has proven the 
wisdom ,of his belief, crowning his labors with success. He built several 
large business blocks on Cordova, Granville and other streets and from that 
time to the present has been a most active factor in the substantial upbuilding 
and improvement of the city. He has not only conducted private business 
interests, but has labored for Vancouver in public office. He was the original 
moving spirit in organizing the company for the building of the street rail- 
way, was the promoter of the electric light company, and was instrumental in 
the building of the tramway between Vancouver and New Westminster. He 
acted as president and managing director of the street railway and of the 
electric light companies for several years, or until he sold his interests. In 
1888 he was elected a member of the city council and again in 1889 and 1890, 
on all occasions receiving the largest vote ever cast in the city. In 1890 he 
was chosen a member oi the legislative assembly of British Columbia, as 
representative from Vancouver, and his course in office has fully justified the 
trust reposed in him. Since coming to British Columbia he has been identi- 
fied with "almost every enterprise of importance which has had for its object 
the development of the country and the promotion of Vancouver's welfare. 
He was chairman of the board of park commissioners for six years and de- 
voted much time and energy to the superintending and beautifying of the 
park. The zoo which now attracts thousands of visitors annually was per- 
sonally started by him at his own expense and donated to the city. Upon two 
occasions he was offered a portfolio in the Davie government, that of minister 
of finance and minister of lands and works, but both of these he declined on 
account of having to devote his entire attention to his varied business interests 
m Vancouver. During his four years' service in the house of the assembly 
he was a most careful and hard working representative and never lost an 
opportunity for furthering the material interests and substantial upbuilding 
of his district. To his zeal and energy is due the fact that the city of Van- 
couver can today boast of many public advantages and splendid edifices, these 
being monuments to his very capable work. Because of his private business 
interests and the conditions of his health Mr. Home decided not to again 
stand for the assembly and in a meeting held by the government supporters the 
following resolution was passed by a standing vote : " Resolved, that the best 
thanks of the general community of the supporters of the government party 



( 



384 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

in the city of Vancouver are hereby accorded to Mr. J. W. Home, Esquire, M, 
P., for the able and valuable services rendered by him to the city of Vancouver 
and the province at large during the four years he has been a member for 
this constituency; that they regret business and other considerations have 
induced him to retire from public life for the present, but hope that on some 
future date he may see fit to allow himself to be put in nomination ^or par- 
liamentary honors." This resolution was most loudly applauded and Mr. 
Home may well be proud of this public acknowledgment of his able service 
by his fellow citizens. Since his retirement from public life his energies have 
been concentrated upon the management of his private business interests. 

Mr. Home is a prominent member of the Masonic fraternity, having at- 
tained the thirty-second degree of the Scottish rite. He is a past master of 
Cascade Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., and is a member of the Grand lodge of British 
Columbia, in which he has filled many offices. Among the eminent men of 
the northwest whose life records form an integral part of the history of 
British Columbia he is numbered and is classed with the most enterprising 
and successful business men, gifted statesmen and loyal citizens. 

JOHN TEAGUE. 

In the field of daily activity John Teague is winning success, an unassail- 
able reputation and a place among the representative business men of Victoria, 
where he is known as a druggist of high ability. He is a native son of this 
city, where his birth occurred on the 28th of December, 1865, and is a rep- 
resentative of old English ancestry. His father, John Teague, Sr., was born 
at Redmuth, Cornwall, England, and joined the rush to the Eraser river gold 
excitement in 1858, where he mined on the Eraser and in the Cariboo District 
with the usual miner's luck, making and losing large sums of money. In his 
earlier career he had learned the business of an architect, and after his re- 
moval to Victoria followed that occupation in connection with contracting 
and building, having erected the Driard hotel and Jubilee hospital, and also 
many of the finest residences and business buildings in the city. He also 
took an active part in municipal affairs, and was the choice of his fellow 
citizens for the position of alderman, while for two terms he served as mayor 
of the city. Mr. Teague chose for his wife Miss Emily Abingfton, who was 
born in South Africa, and was the daughter of S. H. Abington, a native of 
England and interested in missionary work in Africa. In their family were 
six children, four of whom are living, as follows : Mrs. J. G. Brown, Emily, 
Albert and John. All were born in Victoria, and here they still make their 
home, being numbered among the city's most respected residents.

John Teagiie, whose name introduces this review, received his Hterary 
education and learned the druggist's trade in this his native city, and in 
1886 first entered the business world for himself, opening his store on Yates 
street. In 1898 he removed to his present location, No. 27 Johnson street. 
His success has been marked and immediate, for he soon secured a liberal 
patronage, which has increased with the passing years, and he now enjoys 
not only a remunerative trade, but also the good will of his fellow citizens. 
In political matters he holds to the views of the Liberals and religiously is a 
member of the Church of England. 

MARK BATE. 

Mark Bate is one of the oldest living pioneers of British Columbia, and 
the city of Nanaimo holds him in especial esteem, since he has been a resident 
there for nearly fifty years — in fact he was there before anything like a town 
existed. His career throughout has been one of intense industry and per- 
sistent activity in whatever channels chance or purpose has directed his ener- 
gies. He possessed only knowledge of a trade and plenty of ambition as 
capital when he began climbing the road to success, but, judging from his 
present prosperity and high place in the esteem of his fellow men, those quali- 
fications were ample prerequisites for what he sought in life. 

A native of Birmingham, Warwickshire, England, and a son of Thomas 
and Elizabeth (Robinson) Bate, Mr. Bate enjoyed early educational oppor- 
tunities in the Dudley grammar and other schools, and then entered the serv- 
ice of Bramah, Cochrane &amp; Company at the Woodside Iron Works, with 
which his father had also been connected. While thus employed a letter writ- 
ten by his uncle, George Robinson, reached him, in which was a glowing and 
enthusiastic description of the wonderful gold country on the Eraser river in 
British Columbia, and for a young man of energy and athirst for adventure 
this was all that was needed to lure him forth from the quiet and serenity 
of home surroundings, and accordingly in 1856 he set out to join his uncle, 
who, as manager of the Hudson's Bay Company's coal mines at Nanaimo, 
had already partaken of the glories of the British Columbia country. His 
first ten days in the province were spent in Victoria, and since that time 
Nanaimo has been almost continuously his place of residence and the scene 
of his activities. On his arrival he worked at engine driving and weighing 
coal, and then entered the Hudson's Bay Company's office as a clerk, con- 
tinuing thus until the whole Nanaimo estate was sold to the Vancouver Coal 
Company. In 1863 he became the successor of James Farquhar as account- 
ant of the Vancouver Coal Mining &amp; Land Company, Limited, and in 1869 



336 . BRITISH COLUMBIA 

was promoted to the position of local manager, remaining in that capacity 
until the appointment of Mr. Robins as his successor in 1884. In 1886 he 
was appointed to the office of government assessor, and now for almost twenty 
years he has capably and honorably discharged the duties of this public office 
of trust. He was the first mayor of iSTanaimo, serving from 1875 to 1879, 
from 1 881 to 1886, from 1888 to 1889 and from 1898 to 1900, having been 
elected eleven times by acclamation. In 1878, in behalf of the coal company 
he gave the hospital site for the city, also the cemetery site, and aided ma- 
terially the fire department and many other public and private institutions. 
■He edited and partly owned in 1866 the " Nanaimo Gazette," the first paper 
published at Nanaimo, and also, being a moulder, turned out at Nanaimo 
the first casting in iron ever made in British Columbia. 

Mr. Bate has a fine family of bright and capable sons and daughters, and 
of the ten children born to himself and wife eight are still living, namely: 
Emily, who is in South Africa ; Mark, Jr., who' is accountant in the Western 
Fuel Company's office ; Sarah Ann, the wife of W. J. Goepel, of Nelson, Brit- 
ish Columbia ; Thomas Ezra, in business in Cumberland ; George Arthur, one 
of the deceased sons ; Lucy Alicia, wife of Montague Stanley Davis, of Nel- 
son; Mary Beatrice is the wife of George Wadham Bruce Heathcote, who is 
assistant manager of the Bank of Commerce of San Francisco; William 
Charles, deceased; Elizabeth Ada, whose husband, J. H. Hawthornwaite, is 
present member of the provincial parliament of Nanaimo, and John Augustus, 
the youngest. Mr. Bate affiliates with Ashlar Lodge, No. 3, A. F. &amp; A. M., 
with Black Diamond Lodge, No. 5, I. O. O. F., with the Independent Order 
of Foresters and the Ancient Order of United Workmen. The Church of 
England represents his religious faith. 

HON. W. NORMAN BOLE. 

The Hon. W. Norman Bole, local judge of the supreme court and judge 
of the county court at New Westminster, is among the foremost representa- 
tives of the bench and bar of British Columbia, and has the distinction of 
being the longest established legal practitioner on the mainland of British 
Columbia. He was noted for the success which he won in important crim,- 
in'al cases as counsel for the defense, especially as in many instances the fore- 
most legal talent of the province was arrayed against him. On the bench 
his record has been one of unimpeachable integrity, judicial impartiality and 
fearlessness. He has been a factor in civic affairs generally, and in many 
ways his energies have been devoted towards assisting in the progress and 
development of the province. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 337 

In ancestry and family Judge Bole has some of the advantages which 
excellent lineage and inherited character confer. He is the eldest son of the 
late John Bole, Esq., of Lakefield, Mayo, Ireland, and his wife, Elizabeth 
Jane Campbell. His father was for many years deputy clerk of the Crown 
and Peace, besides filling several other public offices of importance. Judge 
Bole is a descendant of an old Surrey family who came over with the Con- 
queror and settled in Ireland as early as 1520. On the maternal side a branch 
of the Campbell clan settled in the north of Ireland under James the First. 
One of the Bole family was Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ire- 
land during the reign of King Edward the Second, and the same office was 
held by the Right Reverend Christopher Hampton, a maternal ancestor, dur- 
ing the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Another ancestor was a captain in the 
army of William the Third and fought at the Boyne. 

Judge Bole was born December 6, 1845, ^^ Castlebar, and was educated 
partly by private tuition and partly in a public school. He passed his final 
examination and was admitted January, 1873. ^^^ ^ ^^^^ he had a suc- 
cessful practice in his native country, and then moved to the United States 
and from there to Canada, spending some time in Quebec. In 1877 he came 
to New Westminster, and in the May assizes of that year was admitted to 
the British Columbia bar, and at once took up active practice. He had the 
honor of being the first lawyer to locate permanently on the mainland. During 
the assizes of that first year he successfully defended nearly every prisoner on 
trial and his practice grew rapidly from that time on. He was appointed 
judge of the county court in September, 1889, for the district of New West- 
minster, which then included the city of Vancouver, and local judge of the 
supreme court in 1891, with special powers in 1892. He became a Queen's 
counsel in May, 1887. I" 1886 he contested the city for the local legislature 
at the general election as opposition candidate, and defeated the government 
candidate by a majority of six to one. 

Only brief mention can be made of some of the important legal trials in 
which Judge Bole has taken part. He, with the late Hon. A. E. B. Davie, 
Q. C, as associate, defended the celebrated cause known as the Scotty trial, 
wherein James Halliday was charged with the murder of Tom Poole, and 
after a third trial and a continuous hearing of nearly a month the prisoner 
was acquitted amid a scene of wild rejoicing and jubilation. He also de- 
fended McLean Brothers, charged with the murder of Mr. Ussher, govern- 
ment agent at Kamloops, and after the first trial got the verdict and sentence 
set aside on legal points, but at the second trial the prisoners were convicted 
on overwhelming evidence. Since his elevation to the bench Judge Bole 



338 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

has tried several important cases, notably that of the Crown versus Lobb, in 
which the defendant was charged with the murder of his wife. The late 
Chief Justice McColl acted for the Crown and Mr. E. P. Davis, K. C, for 
the accused. After a trial lasting a week, during which a very large number 
of important legal points were discussed, the prisoner was acquited of the 
charge. In Sq^tember, 1894, Judge Bole heard the Telford case, in which 
a doctor was charged with manslaughter. This was the first time in Canada 
that a prisoner was tried for manslaughter by a judge sitting alone without 
a jury. After a trial lasting four days a written judgment of acquittal was 
rendered, which met with general approval outside the range of his profes- 
sional and judicial duties. 

Judge Bole, who is a man of energy and varied interests, has devoted 
himself with zest to many other lines of activity. For ten years he was 
president of the New Westminster Rifle Association, and he is now president 
of the New Westminster Gun Club. He was chairman of the Hastings 
Sawmill company, president of the Royal Columbian Hospital, president of 
the Board of Trade and several other organizations and bencher of the Law 
Society. He was a lieutenant in the Seymour Field Battery of Artillery for 
many years, and served as captain of No. i Battery, British Columbia Brigade 
of Artillery, from 1884 to 1887. He has been a director and one of the build- 
ers of the New Westminster and Southern Railway Company, and was solic- 
itor for the Bank of British Columbia from its establishment in New West- 
minster until his elevation to the bench. When the Diamond Jubilee of the 
late Queen Victoria was held in 1897 Judge Bole was selected to deliver the 
oration at New Westminster, and he then addressed an assemblage of five 
thousand people in the open air at Queen's Park, and his eulogy on the be- 
loved Sovereign and her reign was commented upon as one of the most elo- 
quent and impressive tributes ever listened to by a provincial audience. The 
judge has been an export yachtsman and oarsman, as also a crack shot with 
gun, rifle and pistol. He is a zealous Free Mason and a lay delegate of 
the Anglican synod of New Westminster. 

On February 26, 1881, Judge Bole married Florence Blanchard, only 
daughter of Major John Haning Coulthard, justice of the peace for British 
Columbia. Two children have blessed this union : John Percy Hampton 
Bole, now a student at law, formerly a cadet in the Royal Military College, 
Kingston, and Garnet Seymour, who died in 1895. Judge and Mrs. Bole 
have a delightful residence in New Westminster, and they enjoy the high 
esteem of a very wide circle of friends.

EDWARD HEWETSON HEAPS. 

Edward Hewetson Heaps, of the firm of E. H. Heaps &amp; Company, is 
occupying a leading position as a lumber manufacturer of the province of 
British Columbia, being at the head of one of the enterprises that have in 
large measure contributed to the upbuilding, substantial growth and com- 
mercial advancement of the province. 

Mr. Heaps was born in Yorkshire, England, on the 26th of March, 1851. 
His father, Thomas Heaps, also of Yorkshire, was an architect and builder, 
a devoted adherent of the Methodist church, and for fifty years a local 
preacher. He lived to the age of eighty, and left behind him an example 
for sterling integrity, rigid uprightness and undeviating adherence to all 
that was pure and true. He was survived by his beloved wife for three 
years. There were five children of the marriage, all today occupying posi- 
tions of respect and influence. 

Edward H. Heaps, the subject of this sketch, was the youngest of his 
father's family. He was educated at the Egremont Academy, conducted by 
the Rev. Robert Love, and upon completion of his studies was apprenticed 
to the firm of Stead Brothers, cotton brokers, of Liverpool, with whom he 
remained seven years. By steady and unremitting application to his duties 
he earned the respect and confidence of his employers. The firm would will- 
ingly have retained his services and promotion was offered, but Mr. Heaps 
had decided to seek his fortunes in the new world. He remained in America 
for three years, learning the ways of the country, and engaging variously in 
farming, store keeping, and lumbering. At the end of this period he returned 
to England, when his marriage to Miss Anna Robinson, of Manchester, took 
place. For eleven years thereafter he resided in Manchester, carrying on a 
profitable business in the manufacture of cotton goods, a natural development 
of his seven years' experience in the cotton trade. 

His health failing, and there now being a growing family of children 
with futures to provide for, Mr. Heaps again decided to try fortune in the 
new world. Accordingly, in 1886, the family left England for America. 
Three years were spent in the eastern states and Canada, but believing that 
the great northwest offered still further business opportunities, Mr. Heaps 
in 1889 brought his family to British Columbia. , In this province the lum- 
ber industry, with its wonderful future, attracted Mr. Heaps' attention. He 
built a sawmill, sash, door and furniture factory on False Creek. This busi- 
ness was turned into a stock company, and eventually the plant was de- 
stroyed by fire. Mr. Heaps, however, had previously established a machin- 



340 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ery and mill supply business, under the style of E. H. Heaps and Company. 
In the course of this business he again became interested in the manufacture 
of lumber and shingles. The business grew rapidly, and in the year 1896 
Mr. William Sulley became a member of the firm. The business has since 
kept pace with the growth of the city and western Canada, and is now one 
of the largest concerns of the kind in the province. The company operate 
twx) large plants, viz : Cedar Cove Mills in Vancouver, including a modern 
sawmill with a capacity of 100,000 feet per day, large sash and door factory, 
planing mill, box factory, and the second largest shingle mill in the province, 
also well equipped blacksmith and machine shops; and Ruskin Mills on the 
Fraser river at the mouth of Stave river, where the firm owns the town site, 
and operates saw, shingle and planing mills, general store, etc. Shipments 
are made to the eastern and middle states, to all parts of Canada, and to 
foreign markets. Employment is furnished to between five and six hundred 
men. Mr. Heaps devotes his whole attention to the business, which is con- 
ducted u^xju modern lines, in keeping with the progressive ideas of the day. 
His four sons, Edward Moore, James Wilson, John and Arthur Robinson, 
are all engaged with their father in the business. There are besides three 
daughters, Kate Eden, Constance Anna, and Elsie Frankland. The family 
occupy a beautiful home at Cedar Cove, the thriving little suburb which has 
sprung intO' existence as a result of the development of industry at this point. 
They are connected with the Church of England, and take an active part in 
the furtherance of the affairs of All Saints' church at Cedar Cove. Mr. 
Heaps has many friends. His honorable business methods, his unremitting 
diligence, his intellectual strength and individuality have won him well de- 
served success, respect and esteem. 

JAMES ANDREW DOUGLAS. 

James Andrew Douglas, capitalist and a prominent young business man 
of Victoria, was born in this city on the 20th of February, 1878. His an- 
cestry, honorable and distinguished, have aided in shaping the history of 
the province. His grandfather, Sir James Douglas, was the first governor 
of the province and a citizen of great worth, leaving the impress of his indi- 
viduality, his superior talents and public-spirited citizenship upon the annals 
of the northwest. His son, James William Douglas, was born in Victoria 
on the ist of June. 185 1, and died at the comparatively early age of thirty- 
two years, passing away November 7, 1883. He had been educated in Eng- 
land and had studied for the bar. - He had inherited a very large estate 
from his father, which became the property of his widow and two sons. He 




■/r^f^.

BRITISH COLUMBIA 341 

had married Mary Rachel EHiot, a daughter of the Hon. A. C. ElHot, who 
was premier of the province. Their younger son, John Douglas, is now pur- 
suing a college course, preparatory to becoming a member of the medical 
profession. 

James A. Douglas, the elder son and consequent heir to the estate, not 
only inherited large property interests, but also has in his possession many 
cherished heirlooms, including the dress sword and hat of his distinguished 
grandsire. The latter, adorned with a long white plume, he keeps with the 
utmost care in a glass case. 

Mr. Douglas received a liberal education in leading institutions of 
learning in England, and has increased his general information by travel, 
having journeyed around, the world. 'He is now devoting his entire atten- 
tion to the improvement and subdivision of that portion of his estate in Vic- 
toria, where he and his brother have two hundred and thirty acres of land, a 
part of which, in the Fairfield district, is divided into two hundred and nine- 
teen residence lots. In block J there are twenty lots, in block K thirty-one 
lots, each tract containing about an acre and a half and separated by broad 
avenues. This property is very beautifully situated, a portion of it over- 
looking the strait of Fuca, while the inland view is also one of great beauty. 

On the 30th of August, 1899, Mr. Douglas was very happily married in 
England to Miss Jennie Isabella Williams, a daughter of Charles Williams, 
Esquire, of Portsmouth, England, a retired army officer of Irish ancestry. 
The union of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas has been blessed with a son, James 
Donald Douglas, born September 6, 1900. He is a very bright, active and 
beautiful boy, of whom the parents have every reason to be proud. The 
palatial home has been erected in a most attractive portion of the estate. It 
is a large handsome bungalow which was entirely planned by Mrs. Douglas 
and indicates refined and superior taste. The site on which the bungalow 
stands is a somewhat rocky eminence, from which there is a beautiful view 
of the valley below on one side, while on the other one overlooks the strait. 
Inasmuch as possible, the natural beauty of the forest has been preserved. 
The lawn sloping gently from the house is adorned with many varieties of 
rare and choice shrubs and flowers. The place is called Lillooet, the Indian 
word for beautiful. The home is indeed ideal, because of its natural and 
artistic beauty and also because of its generous hospitality, for both Mr. and 
Mrs. Douglas delight in the society of their host of friends. 

Mr. Douglas is very highly regarded as a citizen, and as a business man 
he displays marked enterprise and energy, devoting his attention with grati- 
fying result to the control of his extensive real estate operation. In his 



342 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

business transactions, while laboring for that success which is the legitimate 
goal of all business endeavor, he has also promoted the upbuilding of the 
city along lines of permanent beauty and substantial architectural improve- 
ment. 

LOUIS GREGORY McQUADE. 

Louis Gregory McQuade, of the well known firm of P. McQuade and 
Company, ship chandlers at Victoria, is a citizen highly honored, not alone 
for his substantial personal character, but also for his long connection with a 
business firm which is a pioneer in Victoria and has dealt in ship-outfitting 
supplies for over forty-five years. 

Mr. McQuade is himself a native of the state of New York, born in 
Albany, April 28, 1853. ^^^ father, Peter McQuade, who came to Victoria 
on the 20th day of July, 1858, was a native of Gal way, Ireland, where he was 
born in 1823. The father was educated in his native island, was married 
there to Miss Bridget Fitzpatrick, a native of Dublin, and in 1856 he went to 
California. He was in business in San Francisco for a year or so, and in 
1858 arrived in Victoria and founded the ship chandler's establishment which 
has ever since been successfully carried on either by himself or his son as 
successor. Peter McQuade was a man of broad ability and generous nature, 
and he took a deep interest in public affairs and was always known for his 
progressive citizenship. He was a member of the Victoria Stock Company, 
and also director of the Royal Hospital. He died in 1884 in his sixty-first 
year, and was survived by his good wife, who passed away in 1886. They 
were both devout members of the Roman Catholic church, and the son's fam- 
ily also adhere to that faith. The two daughters are sisters of the Order of 
St. Ann at Montreal. 

Louis G. McQuade, the only surviving son, was but a child when he 
came to Victoria, and this city has been the scene of his youth and adult 
activity. He was educated in St. Louis College at Victoria. He was prac- 
tically brought up in his father's ship chandler's business, so that he has well 
prepared to assume the responsible management of it at his father's death. 
This business, founded in the early year of 1858, has been excellently man- 
aged throughout, and has kept pace with the growth of the city. Everything 
for the complete outfitting of ships is carried in the establishment, and the 
firm is well known all up and down the coast. In addition to this principal 
business Mr. McQuade has for the past eight years owned a schooner which 
he has employed in the sealing business. 

Like his honored father, Mr. McQuade has made the city's welfare his 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 343 

own, and the growth and prosperity of the city have always been regarded 
with him as of equal importance with the success of his own enterprises. He 
is an ex-president of the Board of Trade, and is at present one of the council- 
ors of the board. In politics he has always been a Conservative, but has 
never sought or desired office at the hands of his fellow citizens. He is 
owner of two fine residences in the city as also of other city property, and has 
carried on his affairs with a large degree of success. 

In 1875 Mr. McQuade was married to Miss Mary Norris, who. was born 
in Bowmanville, Ontario. This union has been blessed with three children, 
all born in Victoria : Louis, Anna and Peter. 

LAWRENCE GOODACRE. 

Lawrence Goodacre, who in his business career has ever been watchful 
of. the indications pointing to success and through the improvement of op- 
portunity and the employment of business methods that neither seek nor re- 
quire disguise, has steadily advanced until he is now numbered among the 
prosperous merchants of Victoria, was born in Nottingham, England, on 
the 8th of October, 1848. He pursued his education in his native country 
and there learned the butcher's trade, at which he worked for five years after 
coming to British Columbia. His brother, John Goodacre, came to the 
province in 1864 and in 1866, having received favorable reports concerning 
the country and its opportunities, Lawrence Goodacre also came and soon 
afterward secured employment as a butcher. The Queen's market was 
established in Victoria in 1858, by Thomas Harris, who was afterward mayor 
of the city. Mr. Hutchinson became the next owner and Mr. Goodacre en- 
tered his employ. Mr. Stafford was also in the employ of Mr. Hutchinson, 
and after a time entered into partnership with Mr. Goodacre for the purpose 
of buying out their employer and carrying on the business on their own ac- 
count. They were together for five years, at the end of which time Mr. Staf- 
ford died and Mr. Goodacre then continued the business alone. About three 
years later he was married to the widow of his former partner. For a time 
John Dooley was a partner of Mr. Goodacre in the business, but later the 
subject of this review became sole proprietor and remained alone until he 
admitted his sons to the business under the present firm style of Goodacre &amp; 
Sons. The business, through the careful management and honorable meth- 
ods of Mr. Goodacre, has become a large and profitable one, the trade steadily 
increasing. They never have any difficulty in retaining the trade of old cus- 
tomers and are continually securing new patrons. 

Unto Mr. and Mrs. Goodacre have been born two sons and a daughter,

all natives of Victoria. The sons, Samuel Roy and Samuel W. S., are both 
associated with their father in business and are active and capable young 
business men. The daughter, Louella Maude, resides with her parents. 

In matters of citizenship Mr. Goodacre is public-spirited and progressive 
and has been the champion of many measure whose effect has been far- 
reaching and beneficial. He served as a member of the volunteer fire com- 
pany of Victoria and is now one of the aldermen of the city, exercising his 
official prerogatives in support of every measure which he believes will pro- 
mote the upbuilding and substantial improvement of his adopted city. His 
interest centers here, for he has made it his home through almost forty 
years, maintaining throughout the entire period the reputation of being a 
most reliable business man. 

WILLIAM WALTER NORTHCOTT. 

William Walter Northcott, the assessor of the city of Victoria, British 
Columbia, where he has resided for the past twenty-two years, dating his 
arrival on the 4th of June, 1883, was born in Bristol, England, on the ist of 
June, 1846. and is a representative of old English ancestry. His father, 
John Northcott, was born in Devonshire, England, and with his son, John 
A., emigrated to Canada in the year 1853, the remainder of the family com- 
ing the following year. There he followed contracting and building, having 
in early life learned the carpenter's trade in his native country. He married 
Miss Fanny Parker, who passed away in the year 1855 in the fiftieth year of 
her age. He afterward married again and his death occurred in 1882, when 
he was in the seventy-sixth year of his age. John and Fanny (Parker) 
Northcott were valued members of the Episcopal church, and they were the 
parents of six children. By his second marriage he had five children, and 
two of the family now reside in Victoria, British Columbia : William W. and 
John A. 

William Walter Northcott was only about eight years of age when 
brought by his parents to America. He resided in Belleville, Ontario, and 
was educated in its public schools, after which he acquired a knowledge of 
the builder's art by working with his father. Subsequent to his arrival in 
British Columbia he was for a number of years successfully engaged in 
building operations in Victoria, and on the lOth of February, 1890. he re- 
ceived the appointment to the position of city assessor and for the past fifteen 
years has filled the office most acceptably. He is also inspector of buildings 
and his knowledge of the building trade splendidly qualifies him for the 
duties of his office. In his political views he is Conservative, but as the

BRITISH COLUMBIA 345 

office is one which affects all of the people he takes no active part whatever in 
.politics at the present time. 

In 1867 M^- Northcott was married to Miss' Olive Cronk, a native of 
Ernestown, Canada, and they have become the parents of five children : 
Alice, noyv Mrs. O. A. Earley; Orvilla. now the wife of J. H. Falconer; 
Elizabeth Parker, now Mrs. William Forbes Robertson ; Joseph R. ; and 
William Walter, Jr. The family are communicants of the Church of England 
and Mr. Northcott is an active and valued member of the Masonic fraternity, 
in which he has attained the Royal Arch degree. The sublime degree of the 
Master Mason was conferred upon him in Belleville, Ontario, in 1869, and 
he is now a past master of Victoria Columbia lodge. No. i, A. F. &amp; A. M. 
Mr. Northcott is widely and favorably known throughout the province, his 
abilities well fitting him for the position he now occupies. The terms progress 
and patriotism might be considered the keynote of his character, for through- 
out his career he has labored for the improvement of every line of business 
or public interest with which he has been associated, and at all times has been 
actuated by a fidelity to his country and her welfare. 

JOSEPH AUSTEN SAYWARD. 

No name figures more conspicuously on the pages of the business his- 
tory of Victoria than Joseph Austen Sayward, and this city also claims him 
among its native sons, his birth occurring here on the 17th of July, 1862. 
His father, William Parsons Sayward, is numbered among the Victoria pio- 
neers of 1858. He was a native of the state of Maine, born December 9, 
18 18, and there he received his education and learned the carpenter's trade. 
Subsequently he went to Key West, Florida, and was there engaged in the 
lumber business until 1849, when he journeyed to the gold diggings of Cali- 
fornia, making the journey in a sloop to the Isthmus, and thence on to San 
Francisco. He was a resident of that city during all the exciting times con- 
nected with the reign of the Vigilantes, and at all times performed his full 
share in maintaining law and order. In the year 1858 he came to Victoria 
and erected a sawmill at Mill Bay, and over a quarter of a century ago 
erected another in this city, continuing in the prosecution of a successful 
business until the 13th of July, 1896, when he put aside the active cares of a 
commercial life and has since lived in quiet retirement. Mr. Sayward mar- 
ried Mrs. Ann Chambers, a native of the north of Ireland and a daughter of 
Bernard Connor. She came to the Province about the same time as her 
husband, and her death occurred in 1870, while her husband still survives 
and resides in San Francisco, in the eighty-sixth year of his age, honored 



346 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and respected by all who have the pleasure of his acquaintance. He is a 
member of the Church of England, with which Mrs. Sayward was also con-, 
nected. 

Joseph A. Sayward, the only child of these parents, has spent his entire 
life in the city of his birth, and he early became connected with hjs father's 
business, which he has carried on alone since the latter' s retirement. He is 
engaged in the manufacture of sash, doors and other house material, and 
from its inception the business has constantly grown in volume and impor- 
tance, keeping pace with the growth of the city. In political matters Mr. 
Sayward is a Conservative, and, although not an active politician, is a public- 
spirited citizen and advocates all measures of progress and reform, doing all 
in his power to promote the general welfare. 

In 1884 occurred the marriage of Mr. Sayward and Miss Margaret Liv- 
ingstone, she being a native of Scotland and a daughter of Duncan Living- 
stone. One daughter has come to brighten and bless their home, Miss Mar- 
garet Livingstone, and the family reside in one of the delightful homes for 
which Victoria is noted, and enjoy the high esteem of a wide circle of friends. 

SAMUEL SEA, Jr. 

Samuel Sea, Jr., is a member of the firm of Sea &amp; Go wen, dealers in 
men's furnishing goods in Victoria. His birth occurred in the city which is 
still his home, his natal day being the nth of May, 1869. He comes of 
English ancestry in both the paternal and maternal lines. The name of 
Samuel has long been a favorite one in the family and was worn by both his 
father and grandfather, both of whom were natives of England. His pater- 
nal grandmother is still living at the very advanced age of ninety years. 
Further mention is made of Samuel Sea, Sr., upon another page of this work, 
for he was a pioneer settler of 1858, has been prominent in business life and 
is well deserving of mention in the history of British Columbia. 

Samuel Sea, Jr., the eldest, pursued his education in the public schools 
of his native city and began his business career as a salesman in a dry goods 
house, where he remained for a year. He then entered the Holmes clothing 
store and when Mr. Holmes sold his business to Mr. Waller, the subject of 
this review remained as its manager for six years. He then bought out his 
employer and he continued the business on his own account, conducting it 
alone for three years, at the end of which time he admitted Frederick A. 
Gowen tO' a partnership under the present firm style of Sea &amp; Gowen. Their 
store is located at No. 64 Government street, where they carry a large line of 
men's furnishing goods and this house enjoys the largest trade of Lne kind 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 347 

in the city. Their store and stock is up-to-date in every particular and both 
gentlemen are enterprising business men, representative of the progressive 
spirit of the time. 

Mr. Sea is a member of the Native Sons of the Province, a second vice 
factor of the order and v^'as one of the organizers of the Grand Post, of Brit- 
ish Columbia. He is also a member of the Masonic fraternity, the Ancient 
Order of Foresters and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He holds 
to the religious faith of the Church of England, and he takes an active and 
helpful interest in the v^elfare of the city, although not figuring in political 
circles. He is recognized, however, as one of Victoria's most careful business 
men and throughout his entire life he has been connected with commercial 
interests of the city, so tliat his history, well known to its residents, com- 
mands the respect and confidence of all. 

FLETCHER BROTHERS. 

Fletcher Brothers, the well known music dealers of Victoria and other 
towns in the province of British Columbia, are successfully continuing a 
business which was established by their father nearly forty years ago, and 
which is a pioneer firm of its kind in the province. Their establishment is 
complete, and the great variety of instruments and musical goods of all kinds 
are reasonably priced and can be relied upon to be as represented. Pianos 
and organs of the highest grades are kept in stock, besides all kinds of stringed 
instruments, mechanical playing devices, graphophones, phonographs, a 
large stock of music, and everything in the musical line may be obtained from 
their stock or by quick order from the supply centers. The brothers are ex- 
perienced business men, and have been trained from youth to this line of 
business, so that their ample success is justified and their trade of the broad- 
est proportions. 

Fletcher Brothers firm is composed of George A., James H. and Thomas 
C. Fletcher. Their father, Thomas W. Fletcher, was born in Sheffield, Eng- 
land, in 1839. He came out to Victoria in 1862, and thence went to Cariboo 
county, where he was married to Miss Martha Kelly, a native of Scotland. 
For a time he engaged in mining in the Cariboo region, and also kept a store 
and dealt in miners' supplies. After three years, however, he returned to 
Victoria, in 1865, and established the music house which is now under the 
management of his sons. He devoted his whole time to the business and 
gradually extended its operations and developed it into the principal music 
house of the province. He was a Methodist in religion, while his wife was 
a Presbyterian. They had five children, all born, in Victoria. The gx)od 



348 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

mother died in 1893, but the father still survives and resides at Ladysmith, 
being retired from active duties and being among the respected pioneers of 
the province. 

The eldest son, George A., is the senior member of the firm. He was 
lx)rn in Barkerville, Cariboo, in 1872, and is in charge of the branch stores 
of the firm at Ladysmith and Nanaimo. James H. Fletcher was born in 
Victoria in 1874, and is manager of the Victoria store, which is the head- 
quarters of the business. Thomas C. Fletcher was born in Victoria in 1877, 
and is the traveling salesman and piano tuner for the firm. William R. 
Fletcher, born in Victoria in 1880, is a conductor on the E. &amp; N. Railroad. 
The brothers were all educated in Victoria and the three eldest were brought 
up in the music house of their father and have known the business from 
boyhood. They are all justly proud of the land of their birth and take a 
deep interest in its prosperity. James H. Fletcher, who kindly furnished 
the material for this article, is a member of the Sons of Scotland, the Native 
Sons of British Columbia, and of the Foresters. 

JAMES THOMAS McILMOYL. 

James Thomas Mcllmoyl, grand recorder of the Ancient Order of 
United Workmen of British Columbia, is a resident of more than forty 
years' standing in this province and for many years has been prominently 
identified with the agricultural, business and public affairs of his community 
and province. He has had a varied experience, in the latter part almost 
uniformly successful ; from his early years of mining he turned to farming 
and stock raising, which he followed for many years with prosperous re- 
sults, and in addition to the many duties laid upon him by his private busi- 
ness he has devoted much of his time to fraternal and political work, and is 
well known throughout the province in these connections. 

Mr. Mcllmoyl arrived in Victoria in May, 1862, when he was a young 
man of about twenty-two years. He was born in Ontario, Canada, August 
24, 1840, and his lineage goes back in old Scotland for three hundred years, 
the family seat having for many generations been located in the vicinity of 
Edinburgh. His grandfather Mcllmoyl was born in Liverpool, England, 
and emigrated to this side of the Atlantic while the colonies still adhered 
to Great Britain. At the time of the American revolution he remained loyal 
to the king, and for this reason left the colonies and moved to Upper Canada, 
where he obtained lands from the government. His son, James Disert Mcll- 
moyl, was torn in Ontario. He followed farming and lumbering. He was a 
Presbyterian and his good wife a Methodist. They both attained advanced 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 849 

ages, he passing away when eighty-two and she in the same year and aged 
seventy-six. They were the parents of nine children, of whom three daugh- 
ters and the son, James Thomas, survive. 

Mr. Mcllmoyl is the only member of the family in British Columbia, 
He was educated in the public schools of Ontario, and afterward served an 
apprenticeship in a general store. After he came out to Victoria in 1862 his 
first destination was the Cariboo mining district, and for the following live 
years he prospected and mined in that region before he became fully satisfied 
that mining was not his forte and that he could make a surer livelihood in 
some other way. He then returned to Victoria, and in 1870 purchased the 
farm of one hundred and fifty acres which he still owns. He improved this 
property, and was a successful grain and stock farmer thereon for many 
years. In 1897 he leased the farm to his son, and since then has been re- 
tired from the more strenuous occupations of life. 

He had not been long in this province before he became interested in 
public affairs. He was elected and served for four years as representative 
of the eighth district of Victoria in the provincial legislature, this district in- 
cluding his own home. He was also a prominent official of the agricultural 
association for sixteen years, and was secretary of his school district during 
the entire period of his residence in the country. He was appointed a justice 
of the peace in 1873, and this appointment has never since been revoked. 
In 1883 Mr. Mcllmoyl became a member of the Ancient Order of United 
Workmen, in the ranks of which order he has faithfully worked ever since. 
He has almost constantly held some of the offices of the order, and has passed 
through all the chairs. He was elected master workman of his lodge at the 
meeting by which it was organized. He has been through all the chairs of 
the grand lodge of the province, and has been a representative to ten sessions 
of the supreme grand lodge. In 1895 he was elected grand recorder, the 
office which he is still filling to the fullest satisfaction of the entire order in 
this province. 

In 1870 Mr. Mcllmoyl was happily married to Miss Ann Simpson. She 
was born in Esquimault, being a daughter of Mr. Henry Simpson, an honored 
pioneer to the northwest coast, having arrived in 1852. Mr. and Mrs. Mc- 
llmoyl had eleven children, all born at the home place near Victoria. The 
eldest, James H., is now running the farm; Nellie, now Mrs. Charles Post, 
resides in Victoria; Charles W. and Walter are also farmers; Frank, who 
was an upholsterer, died at the age of twenty-five; George A. is a bookkeeper, 
and Frederick is in the upholstering business. The following are at home 
with their father : Ernie A., Alma Beatrice, and Bertram and Robert, twins. 



850 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

In 1895 ^^^- Mcllmoyl suffered a sad bereavement in the death of his wife, 
who had been his devoted companion for a quarter of a century, and both 
family and community felt a deep personal loss in her taking away. Mr. 
Mcllmoyl holds firmly to the faith of the Presbyterian church. 

JAMES P. HIBBEN. 

James Parker Hibben, who in his business career exemplifies the enter- 
prising spirit which has led to the rapid and substantial development of the 
northwest, is a native son of Victoria and now a member of the firm of T. N. 
Hibben &amp; Company, proprietors of the largest book and stationery store of 
the city. He was born on the 29th of October, 1864. His father, Thomas 
Napier Hibben, who was the founder of the store, came to the province in 
1858. He was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1828 and crossed the 
plains in 1849 '^^ ^ " prairie schooner." At length the long and arduous 
journey was completed and he engaged in mining in California. Later he 
established a book and stationery store in San Francisco, where he carried on 
business until 1858, when he sold to Bancroft, the historian, who afterward 
published Bancroft's History of the Pacific Coast. 

When that business transaction had been consummated Thomas N. Hib- 
ben came to Victoria. Here he met Mr. Carswell and they formed a partner- 
ship and purchased the Kurskis book-store, which they conducted together 
until 1866. At the end of that time Mr. Hibben purchased his partner's in- 
terest and continued the business alone, building up an excellent trade. He 
was at first located on Yates street and three years later removed to the 
present fine establishment in the center of the business district on Govern- 
ment street. From the first his liberal and honorable management of the 
enterprise secured a large trade, which has continued to increase each year 
until the establishment is the largest of the kind in the city. 

Early in the '60s Thomas N. Hibben went to England, where he was 
happily married to Miss Janet Parker Brown, a native of Paisley, Scotland, 
and he then brought his bride to Victoria, making the journey by way of 
the Isthmus of Panama and thence up the Pacific coast. Mr. Hibben was 
devoted to his family and did everything in his power to promote their wel- 
fare and enhance their happiness. He was a gentleman of the highest in- 
tegrity of character, as manifest in his business relations and in his citizen- 
ship. He never sought, desired or held office, but gave his entire attention 
to the control of his business and the enjoyments of home life, and through- 
out the city he held the confidence and respect of those with whom he was 
brought in contact. He departed this life on the loth of January, 1890, 




THOMAS N. HIBBEN.

BRITISH COLUMBIA 351 

amid the deep regret of many friends. He had long been recognized as a 
valued citizen, and because of his championship of many measures for the 
general good his death came as a public calamity to the community. 

Unto Mr. and Mrs, Hibben had been born four children, all now grown 
to adult age, namely : Mary R., the wife of W. D. Claussen, a resident of 
California; Estelle Theus, who became the wife of T. Claussen, a brother 
of her sister's husband; Thomas Napier, who resides in Victoria and is also 
interested in the book and stationery business ; and James Parker, who rep- 
resents his mother's and his own interest in the business, with William H. 
Bone as partner. Both a wholesale and retail trade is carried on and the 
business has become the most extensive in its line in the province. The 
methods inaugurated by the father have always been maintained, and the 
house enjoys an unassailable reputation. James P. Hibben has been con- 
nected with the business from boyhood, and in the management displays ex- 
cellent executive force, keen discernment and marked sagacity. 

The family are Episcopalians in religious faith and occupy a very promi- 
nent social position. Mr. Hibben and his brother are both native sons of 
Victoria, prominent in its business circles and devotedly attached to the city 
of their birth. . 

THOMAS KILPATRICK. 

Thomas Kilpatrick, prominent railroad man and with extensive material 
and civic interests in Revelstoke and vicinity, came to this locality as part of 
the current of activity which flowed westward with the building of the Can- 
adian Pacific Railway, and on reaching Revelstoke remained to become an 
important factor in business interests and in the general welfare and prog- 
ress of interior British Columbia. Mr. Kilpatrick has accomplished a well 
deserved success, and is a strong, energetic, acute executor of all affairs in- 
trusted to his charge. 

A native of Simcoe, Norfolk county, Chitario, where he was born April 
27, 1857, he has since lost both parents, James and Elizabeth (Netherly) 
Kilpatrick, under whose kind parental care he was well reared and trained 
for a career of honorable activity and usefulness. He enjoyed part of his 
education in a private school in Simcoe and also attended the public schools 
of Norfolk county. His father being a farmer, he was accustomed from 
earliest boyhood to the duties of a farm, and the first twenty-seven years of 
his life were spent on the old homestead. In May, 1884, he got into railroad 
work and has almost continuously since followed that line of activity. As an 
employe of the Canadian Pacific in the construction of that great trunk road 



352 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

he landed in Revelstoke in 1885. In 1893 he was appointed superintendent 
of the bridge-building department of this road, in which position he continued 
for some years, and in 1901 was promoted to superintendent of the division 
from Laggan to Kamloops, a distance of two hundred and seventy-five miles. 
He is also superintendent of the Simacous and Okanogan branch and of the 
branch from Revelstoke to Arrowhead. His energy and devotion to the 
welfare of the road have gained him deserved promotion to responsible of- 
fices, and in the past twenty years he has made advancement which would 
be creditable to any man. Mr. Kilpatrick has important interests in mining 
and in timber and coal lands of the northwest, and both as an executive and 
as a successful business man he wields much influence in this part of the prov- 
ince. 

In April, 1903, Mr. Kilpatrick married Miss Elsie McKinnon, of Prince 
Edward Island, and they have one child, Thomas Donald. Their religious 
faith is that of the Church of England. 

JAMES ERNEST SPANKIE, M. D. 

Dr. James Ernest Spankie has during the thirteen years which have 
marked the period of his professional career met with gratifying success and 
during the years of his residence in Greenwood he has won the good will and 
patronage of many of its best citizens. He is a thorough student and en- 
deavors to keep abreast with the times in everything relating to the discoveries 
in medical science. Progressive in his ideas and favoring modern methods 
as a whole he does not dispense with the time-tried systems whose value 
has stood the test of years. 

Dr. Spankie was born in Kingston, Ontario, September 22, 187 1, his 
parents being William and Margaret (Langtry) Spankie, both of whom are 
now deceased, the father having died in 1896 at the advanced age of 
ninety-two years. The first political meeting held by Sir John A. McDonald 
was held in the home of William Spankie. Mrs. Spankie was a native of 
New York and died in 1880. 

Dr. Spankie was a public-school student' in Kingston, Ontario, and also 
attended a private academy which was a preparatory school. He studied 
medicine in Queens University, pursuing the full course and being graduaced 
with the class of 1891. Previous to this time he had pursued a full course in 
the drug business and received a diploma from the College of Pharmacy in 
Toronto, but desirous of entering upon the practice of medicine he began 
preparation for that in Queens University and following his graduation there 
he pursued a post-graduate course of study in the Bellvue Hospital Medical 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 353 

College of New York City, devoting most of his time while in the institu- 
tion to the subject of surgery. He practiced with his brother in Kingston 
for a year, and following his post-graduate work he returned to Kings- 
ton, where he remained for six months. On the expiration of that period 
he went to Banff and assisted Dr. Brett in a sanitarium for four years, gain- 
ing broad and practical experience there. The fall of 1899 witnessed his 
arrival in Greenwood, where he has since remained, and in his practice here 
he has been quite successful. Concentration of purpose and a persistently 
applied energy rarely fail of success in the accomplishment of any task how- 
ever great and in tracing the career of Dr. Spankie it is plainly seen that 
these have been the secret of his rise to prominence. In addition to his 
practice he is largely interested in mining, recognizing that the country 
has a brilliant future in store for it in this particular. 

In June, 1903, occurred the marriage of Dr. Spankie and Miss Grace Isa- 
bel Mulligan, of New York. He belongs to the Masonic fraternity, to 
the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias lodge, the 
Fraternal Order of Eagles and the Canadian Order of Chosen Friends. 
He is a Conservative in politics and he contested the late election for Parlia- 
ment for the Greenwood district. He was offered the unanimous nomination 
but refused. On the party insisting he finally decided to accept the nomina- 
tion but was defeated by the influence of the Socialist party. He belongs 
to the Presbyterian church and is deeply interested in all that pertains to 
the social, intellectual and moral progress of his community. In his pro- 
fessional relations he is connected with the New York State Medical Asso- 
ciation, the Ontario Medical Association, the Northwest Territory Medical 
Association and the British Columbia Medical Association, and is inter- 
ested in everything that tends to bring to man a solution to the difficult 
problems which continually confront the physician in his efforts to check the 
ravages of disease and restore health. Recognizing the benefits of a genial 
atmosphere as well as of the great remedial agencies Dr. Spankie always 
brings to the sickroom a cordial sunshiny disposition and has the faculty 
of inspiring his patients with hope and courage. 

MARTIN J. O'BRIEN. 

Martin J. O'Brien, prominent citizen and business man of Revelstoke, 
has spent all his years since arriving at maturity in this northwest country, 
and has prosecuted various enterprises and almost invariably successfully. 
He is a man of much enterprise and energy sufficient to carry out well what- 
ever he undertakes, and he is very influential in Revelstoke. 



354 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. O'Brien was born in Frontenac county, Ontario, November 21, 
1862. His parents, James and Mary (Carey) O'Brien, are both deceased. 
He was educated in the public schools and at the Sydenham higPi school, 
and when the time came for him to start out on his own account he was fairly 
well equipped for a career. In 1883, being twenty-one years old, he went 
to Winnipeg, and at Portage la Prairie was employed in a grocery and 
liquor house and also as bookkeeper for one year. He then joined with 
Alex Mclntyre in the conduct of a wholesale liquor business at Winnipeg, 
and continued this until the spring of 1886, when he came to Donald, British 
Columbia, and engaged in the same line of business in connection with 
Charles Fox. Theirs was the first liquor store o.pened in the interior of the 
province, and Mr. O'Brien took the first consignment of whiskey to British 
Columbia over the prairies and with police escort. He remained at Donald 
until 1890, when he went along the line of the Great Northern Railway, 
and for two years was bookkeei)er for a contracting firm. For the following 
two years he did prospecting in the neighborhood of Nelson. In 1894 he 
began the manufacture of soda water at Vernon and also in Revelstoke, and 
his connection with the latter city has proved to be permanent. In 1900 he 
organized the Revelstoke Wine and Spirit Company, of which he is the man- 
aging director, and the success of this enterprise has been largely due to his 
energetic and shrewd management. 

In 1899 Mr. O'Brien married Miss Charlotte Dunsmuir, a daughter of 
James Dunsmuir, of Stratford, Ontario. The three children who have come 
to bless their home are Gladys, Lottie and Martin, Jr. The family are Roman 
Catholics in religious faith. Mr. O'Brien participates actively in municipal 
affairs, and during the years 1902 and 1903 held the office of mayor in Revel- 
stoke. 

FREDERICK B. PEMBERTON. 

Frederick B. Pemberton, whose real estate operations have become ex- 
tensive, making him one of the representative and successful business men 
of Victoria, has spent his entire life in this city. His birth occurred here 
on the 26th of April, 1865, his parents being Joseph Despard and Theresa 
Jane (Grautoff) Pemberton. The mother was descended from German an- 
cestry long resident of England, while the father was born in Dublin, Ire- 
land, in 1 82 1. He acquired his education in Trinity College of his native 
city, and afterward studied civil engineering under the direction of G. W. 
Hemans, M. I. C. E., M. R. I. A., subsequent to which time he was appointed 
assistant engineer on a part of the Great Southern and Western Railroad.

He was also for some time in the employ of Sir John McNeill, L. S. D., 
F. R. S., M. I. C. E., M. R. I. A., and afterward did engineering for the 
E^st Lancastershire and Manchesterbury &amp; Rosendale Railway Companies. 
He was resident engineer for the Exeter &amp; Crediton Railway Company and 
was for several years professor of engineering at the Royal Agricultural Col- 
lege in Cirincester, leaving that institution in 185 1, in order to accept the 
position of surveyor general of British Columbia with the Hudson's Bay 
Company. In 1850 he had been awarded a medal by the prince consort for 
his design for the Crystal Palace. 

After coming to British Columbia Hon. Joseph D. Pemberton took a 
very prominent and influential part in shaping the policy and promoting the 
progress of the province. He was elected to the first legislative assembly of 
Vancouver Island and from 1863 until 1866 he sat in the executive council. 
His ready appreciation for and recognition of opportunity led to his co-opera- 
tion in many measures that had for their object the general good, and he like- 
wise assisted materially in the upbuilding of the province along other lines, 
aside from the legislative. In 1858 he laid out the town of Derby, the pro- 
posed capital of the colony of British Columbia. He took up one thousand 
acres of land, made improvements, and in the midst of that locality built a 
fine residence. He became an extensive breeder of shorthorn cattle and Clyde 
horses, being a pioneer of that industry in his part of the province, and thtis 
he contributed directly to the material progress of the locality by introducing 
grades of stock that advanced the prices of cattle and horses and made a 
better market for the products of the farm. In 1863 he returned to England 
for his wife, whom he brought with him to his new home near the Pacific. 
They became the parents of six children, all born in Victoria, namely : Joseph 
D., who is residing in the Northwest Territory; W. P. D., who is engineer 
for a large coal mining company; Ada G., now Mrs. H. R. Beaven; Sophia 
T., at home; and Harriet S., also at home. The father departed this life on 
the nth of November, 1893, '" the seventy-second year of his age, while 
Mrs. Pemberton is still living. 

Frederick B. Pemberton, after acquiring his preliminary education in 
the province, was sent to England, where he continued his studies in the 
University College of London, from which institution he was graduated with 
the class of 1886, having completed a course in civil and mechanical engineer- 
ing. He followed that profession for some time after his return to Victoria, 
but later engaged in the real estate business with his father, in which he has 
since continued, meeting with eminent success. He is now rated as one of 
the most reliable, prosperous and enterprising business men of his native city, 



356 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

controlling many important realty negotiations and having a clientage in the 
line of his chosen vocation that makes his business a very prosperous one. 

Moreover, as a citizen, Mr. Pemberton is entitled to the regard of his 
fellow men, because of the active and helpful co-operation he has given to 
many movements which have resulted in benefit to the city. He is a director 
of the Provincial Royal Jubilee Hospital. Prominent socially, he is presi- 
dent of the Horticultural Society, the Golf Club and the Hunt Club, and in 
the fall of each year he enjoys a hunting trip and now has a large collection 
of the fine specimens of the game he has killed. He owns a number of valu- 
able hunting dogs and fine riding horses, and also has draft horses of the 
Clydesdale strain. 

Mr. Pemberton was married, on the 29th of November, 1893, to Miss 
Mary A. D. Bell, a native of Toronto, Canada, and they have five children, 
all born in Victoria, namely : Frederick Despard, Armine Morris, Warren 
C, Phillipa Despard and Mab O'Herne. The family are members of the 
Church of England and occupy an enviable social position. Mr. Pemberton 
has erected a most attractive home, which he has appropriately named Mont- 
joy. 

JAMES I. WOODROW. 

, James I. Woodrow has been engaged in the butcher business at Revel- 
stoke and also extensively interested in mines in the vicinity since 1891, and 
is one of the most highly respected and successful men of interior British 
Columbia. He has spent most of his active life in this province, where he 
has proved himself able and enterprising in business affairs, a man of absolute 
integrity and honesty of purpose, and of recognized worth as an individual 
and as a factor in the community affairs. 

Mr. Woodrow was born in Lincolnshire, England, November 30, 1864. 
His father, Charles Woodrow, is still living as a respected old citizen of 
Hampshire, England, but his mother, Matilda (Sebastian) Woodrow, is de- 
ceased. After passing through the ordinary school branches in Berkshire 
and then attending a grammar school, which completed his educational equip- 
ment for life, Mr. Woodrow gave hnnself to the serious business of gaining 
a livelihood, and in 1888 came out tO' British Columbia. He was at Vancouver 
a time, worked on the Eraser river bridge at Mission Junction, took up farm- 
ing at Nicomen and after continuing that a brief season went to work for 
his cousin. J. C. Woodrow, at Vancouver, in the meat business. Leaving 
Vancouver he went to Quilchena in Nicola valley, where he operated a ranch 
for a short time, and then opened a butcher shop in Kamloops. In 189 1, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 857 

as mentioned above, he started his butcher business in Revelstoke, and has 
since continued it with .increasing success and is the leading man in that 
occupation in this vicinity. He has mining interests in this district, and has 
prosecuted his business career with an excellent meed of success. 

In 1898 Mr. Woodrow married Miss Katherine Edith Dunn, whose 
father, John Dunn, was a resident of Woolton Hill, Hampshire, England. 
Mr. and Mrs. Woodrow have two children, Roger Dunn and Leon Prevost. 
Mr. Woodrow fraternizes with Revelstoke Lodge No. 25, Independent Order 
of Odd Fellows, and is also a member of the Sons of England. 

FREDERICK CARNE. 

Frederick Carne, who is one of the representative business men of Vic- 
toria, prominently engaged in the retail grocery trade, has made his home 
in this city since 1864, covering a period of forty years. He was born in 
Burealstone, Devonshire, England, August 18, 1856, and for many genera- 
tions his ancestors resided in that country. His father, Frederick Came, was 
a native of Lescord, Cornwall, England, and was there reared and educated. 
In the place of his nativity he married Miss Harriet Pearce, of Sudruth, 
Cornwall. He was a miner by occupation and leaving his native country he 
went to the mining districts around Lake Superior and afterward to Cal- 
ifornia, arriving in the latter state in 1856. In 1858 he went to the Eraser 
river, attracted by the gold discoveries along that stream and he met the 
usual experiences of the early miner, at times securing a large amount of gold 
and then again investing it in a search for a greater measure of the precious 
metal. Carnes creek was named in his honor, he being one of the pioneer 
prospectors in that locality. He prospected in Cariboo and throughout that 
mining region and in the Big Bend country. Later he returned to Vic- 
toria and there joined his family, who had come to British Columbia from 
England in 1864. About that time he purchased the Angel Hotel, which he 
conducted successfully up to the time of his death, which occurred in April, 
1904, when he was in the seventy-sixth year of his age. For forty years he 
had b«een a popular and well known hotel proprietor of Victoria. He had a 
very wide acquaintance, enjoying the friendship of many citizens of Vic- 
toria as well as of the traveling public. His wife still survives him and is 
yet conducting the hotel. Mr. Carne v/as one of the prominent members 
of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and was a worthy and honorable 
citizen. In the family were the following children: Elizabeth, now the 
wife of J. L. Crimp; Amelia, the wife of A. D. Whittier; Mary Jane, the 
wife of J. A. Grant; and Frederick. 



358 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

In taking up the personal history of Frederick Carne we present to the 
readers of this volume the record of one who has a. wide acquaintance both 
through business connections and socially. He acquired his education in 
\^ictoria and at the age of fifteen years entered upon his business career as an 
employe in the store of David Spencer, who carried a line of books and 
notions. He there remained for two years, after which he entered the 
grocery store of A. Rickman, with whom he remained for twelve years, 
acquiring a thorough knowledge of the grocery business. His careful hus- 
banding of his resources enabled him in 1884 to engage in business on his own 
account and he opened a store in the Odd Fellows Block on Douglas street. 
Later he removed to Johnson street and in 1894 established his business at 
his present location. No. 18 Yates street. For the past twenty years he has 
l3een one of the successful merchants, developing a profitable commercial enter- 
prise through the honorable methods and earnest desire to please his patrons. 
He enjoys the thorough confidence of his customers by reason of his straight- 
forward dealings and among his patrons are numbered many who have 
given him their business support since he started out for himself. In con- 
nection with two others he is also engaged in the sealing trade and is 
the owner of three schooners. 

In October, 1885. Mr. Carne was united in marriage to Miss Agties 
Gowan, a native of Victoria and a daughter of Charles King, a respected 
pioneer of this city. They have had six children, of whom five are living, 
all born in Victoria : August, Fred, Marjory, Harold and Agnes. Theirs is 
one of the pleasant homes of Victoria, attractive in ap;pearance and noted 
for its generous hospitality. Mr. Carne is a member of the Ancient Order 
of United Workmen and of the IndqDendent Order of Odd Fellows, in 
w^hich he has passed all the chairs. He and his wife favor the Methodist 
church, although they are not members thereof. Mr. Carne is a very active 
and creditable business man, highly deserving of the success which has come 
to him, his prosperity having been won by close application and unremitting 
attention to his business. He commands the respect of all with whom he is 
associated by reason of his sterling worth. 

WILLIAM SINCLAIR GORE. 

William Sinclair Gore, of Victoria, is deputy minister of lands and works 
for the province of British Columbia and has had a very successful and 
broadly useful career as a civil engineer and government official, extending 
over forty years. He is thoroughly acquainted with the Northwest Terri- 
tory and the province of British Columbia, his work having taken him over 





^^^/-i^^^-^c^^h^t^^-^ 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 359 

a great part of this country, and his skill and efficiency have given him a 
high rank in the civil service of the provincial government. 

Mr, Gore was born in London, Ontario, June 29, 1842. He is of good 
old Irish lineage, being a descendant of the Earls of Arran. His father, 
Thomas Sinclair Gore, was born at Goremount, County Antrim, Ireland, 
and married Miss Harriet Hitchcock, a native of the same county. After 
their marriage they came out to Canada, in 1841, where Mr, Gore followed 
the profession of civil engineer. 

Mr. Gore and his brother, Thomas Sinclair Gore, are the only members 
of the family in British Columbia. Mr. Gore had excellent educational 
privileges in his youth, part of his early training having been received in 
Dublin, Ireland. He was also at school in Barry, Ontario. He decided to 
follow the profession of his father, and took a course in civil engineering at 
Toronto, where he received his diploma as a Dominion land surveyor in* 
1863. For a num.ber of years he was employed in railroad construction in 
the United States, until he received an appointment from the Dominion gov- 
ernment as a surveyor of the lands of the Hudson's Bay Company. This 
work took him all through the Northwest Territory, and after it was com- 
pleted he received the government appointment as surveyor general of the 
province of British Columbia. In 189 1 he was promoted to the office of 
deputy minister of lands and works for this province, which he has since ad- 
ministered to the entire satisfaction of all concerned. 

In 1868 Mr. Gore married Miss Jennie Blodgett, a native of the state 
of Massachusetts. They have two sons : Thomas Sinclair Gore is now a resi- 
dent of the city of Mexico, and Arthur Sinclair Gore is in the provincial 
government service. Their home in Victoria is one of the many pleasant and 
delightful residences of this city of homes, and the house is surrounded by 
trees and flowers, and everything indicates the good taste and cheerful nature 
of these honored and esteemed citizens. 

JOHN HENDRY. 

In the history of the wonderful development of the northwest no name 
stands forth more conspicuously or honorably than that of John Hendry, for 
he has been the promoter of business interests which, while advancing his 
individual prosperity, have been of the greatest benefit to the province. He 
is to-day president of the Vancouver, Westminster &amp; Yukon Railway Com- 
pany, and also president of the British Columbia Mills, Timber &amp; Trading 
Company, the latter being the oldest and largest enterprise of the kind in 
the northwest. He belongs to that class of men who, because of their recog- 



360 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

nition of business possibilities, their executive force and celerity in action, 
have become known in this great age of commercial and industrial activity 
as promoters, and who are the real founders and builders of industries and 
cities. 

John Hendry, spending his boyhood days in his parents' home, was 
educated in the public schools of New Brunswick, and there learned mill 
engineering, after which he went, in 1872, by way of California, to British 
Columbia, and soon afterward turned his attention to milling at New West- 
minster. He also assisted building a mill at Moodyville, superintending its 
construction, and was thus closely associated with the pioneer development 
of business enterprises in this section of the country. In 1875 he returned 
to Manitoba, but soon afterward again came to British Columbia and en- 
gaged in business on his own account in Nanaimo. Again locating in West- 
minster, he followed the fortunes of that city for some time, and as soon as 
Vancouver gave promise of rapid and substantial development he invested 
in mill property here and eventually became the leader in the movement re- 
sulting in the merging of all the milling interests of this place. He is to-day 
the president of the British Columbia Mills, Timber &amp; Trading Company, 
the largest of the kind in the northwest, giving employment to about two 
thousand men. The sawmill has a capacity of one hundred and seventy-five 
thousand feet of lumber in ten hours, and the daily product of the three mills 
reaches about three hundred and fifty thousand feet in ten hours. Doors, 
sash blinds and all building materials are manufactured, and the company is 
now constructing the ready-made houses, using a patent joint invented by 
the Mahony local manager of the Royal City branch, which renders them 
weather and water tight. The company owns and uses twenty-one logging 
engines, five locomotives and twenty-five miles of railroad, extending from 
their timber districts to the water, and also has seven steamers utilized in the 
lumbering trade. The product is shipped to all parts of the world, including 
Australia, China, Japan, South Africa, South America, the United Kingdom 
and all parts of the world reached by water and rail. 

The Hastings sawmill branch had its origin in 1865, Captain Edward 
Stamp being its first manager. He organized an English company under 
the name of the British Columbia &amp; Vancouver Island Spar LumlDer &amp; Saw- 
mill Company, Limited. He had been interested in a mill on the west coast 
of Vancouver Island, and he built the new mill where the present plant is 
located. The business was conducted under the management of Captain 
Stamp until 1868, when, having some trouble with the company, he was suc- 
ceeded by Captain J. A. Raymon. Not long afterward the affairs of the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 361 

company reached such an involved condition that the mill was shut down and 
the company wound up the business and sold the milling plant. The capacity 
at that time was about fifty thousand feet of lumber in ten hours. The plant 
was purchased by S. F. Dickson &amp; DeWolfe &amp; Company, an English firm, 
and the business was resumed under the name of the Hastings Sawmill Com- 
pany in September, 1870. Captain Raymon was returned as manager, and 
continued in that position until 1882, when his death occurred, and he was 
succeeded by Richard H. Alexander, who had been Mr. Raymonds assistant 
from 1870. In 1886 the Canadian Pacific Railroad was extended to Van- 
couver, and the business was then purchased by the syndicate. The property 
extended from Carroll street to where the sugar refinery is now located and 
back to False creek, where at the head of False creek the company had twelve 
hundred acres of land, all covered with forest trees, at the time the railroad 
was built. The Hastings Sawmill Company, Limited, took the mill site west 
of the railway track and all of the timl:&gt;er and logging camps. In 1891 that 
company was bought out by the owners of the Royal City Planing Mills of 
New Westminster. The two companies were then merged into one, and the 
British Columbia Mills, Timber &amp; Trading Company was formed with John 
Hendry as president and general manager. He had formerly been the presi- 
dent of the Royal City Planing Mill Company. The present officers are 
John Hendry, president, and C. M. Beecher, vice-president. They now own 
the Hastings mill, the Royal City planing mills at the end of Carroll street in 
Vancouver, the Royal City planing mill in New Westminster and the Moody- 
ville mill. The capacity of the works was increased to one hundred and 
sixty thousand feet, and the business was being operated on an extensive 
scale in 1898, when the plant was destroyed by fire. It was then rebuilt and 
supplied with all modern improved machinery, while the capacity was in- 
creased to one hundred and seventy-five thousand feet in ten hours. It is 
capable of being increased to two hundred and fifty thousand feet in ten hours 
as soon as market conditions require it. The company now controls a daily 
product of about three hundred and fifty thousand feet in ten hours. They 
own the wharfs, dry kilns and railroad facilities for shipping, and to the 
ability and energy of Mr. Hendry, Mr. Beecher and Mr. Alexander is due all 
of the credit for the development and upbuilding of this vast business enter- 
prise. 

Mr. Hendry has also acquired large property interests in Vancouver, 
New Westminster and in the Kootenay country. In 1894 he became active 
in forming a company which acquired a local charter for a railroad from 
Vancouver north and extending east through the Cascade range, touching at 



362 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Squamish, Lillooet, Anderson Lake and extending on to the Cariboo country. 
It proved, however, to be too early for this undertaking and the project lapsed. 
In 1900 a number of the enterprising citizens of Vancouver and New Westmin- 
ster secured a provincial charter for a railroad from Westminster by way of 
Squamish, Anderson Lake, Lillooet, thence up the Fraser river by canal to 
Fort George, and on to the boundary of British Columbia, toward the Yukon, 
and subsequently they secured a Dominion charter for the same road to 
Yukon, to Dawson and to the boundary line of Alaska. They purchased 
the interest secured through the provincial charter, and Mr. Hendry man- 
aged the finances required to build and equip the road from Westminster to 
Vancouver. This part of the road has been built, and is now m operation, 
with its terminus exactly in the center of the city of Vancouver. Indeed, he 
has been the president and the moving spirit of the enterprise since the or- 
ganization of the company, and is now negotiating for the continuance of 
the construction of the road. It will cross the lines of the Grand Trunk 
Pacific and the Canadian Northern roads, while connected at Westminster 
with all the southern roads from Mexico and with all the trans-Pacific roads. 
The value of such a road to its projectors and to the country at large is des- 
tined to be very great, and Mr. Hendry in carrying forward such a project 
will confer a benefit upon British Columbia, the extent of which cannot be 
estimated, but which will make him worthy of the gratitude of the entire 
province. 

In 188 1 Mr. Hendry was married to Miss Adaline McMillan, a native 
of Nova Scotia and a daughter of Daniel McMillan. The union is blessed 
with one daughter, Miss Aldyen Irene Hendry. The family have two fine 
residences, one in New Westminster and one in Vancouver. Mr. and Mrs. 
Hendry are adherents of the Presbyterian church, and he is active in church 
work, giving generously toward the building of churches and also being a 
liberal contributor tO' charitable and benevolent objects. He is a thirty-sec- 
ond degree Mason and in his life exemplifies the beneficent spirit of the craft. 
He has served as president of the Board of Trade of New Westminster and 
also of Vancouver, is vice-president for British Columbia of the Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association, and is ever alert to promote the best interests of 
both towns and of the entire province. His business ability and enterprise 
make him one of the foremost men of the great northwest, and his efforts 
have contributed in large measure to the development of its natural resources, 
resulting in great benefit to the entire province.

WILLIAM MUNSIE. 

William Miinsie is a representative business man of Victoria, and dur- 
ing the last twenty-five years his connection with a number of important 
enterprises has made his work effective of great results in the substantial devel- 
opment and business growth of Victoria. He has resided in the province 
of British Columbia since 1878. and his business energy and ability as an 
organizer and director have ever since been in evidence as an aid to the welfare 
of the country. 

Mr. Munsie is a native of Nova Scotia, was born at Pictou, January 4, 
1849, ^nd is representative of an old Canadian family of Scotch antecedents. 
His grandfather, William Munsie. was born in Scotland, and when a young 
man emigrated to Pictou. Nova Scotia. John Munsie, the father of Mr. 
Munsie. was born, reared and educated in Nova Scotia. He married Miss 
Alice Harris, whose father was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where her 
family were early settlers, and that city was named after the family. Her 
grandfather at the time of the American revolution remained loyal to the 
king, and hence it l3ecame necessary for him to move to Nova Scotia, where 
the loyalists from the colonies were granted lands by the crown. The office 
of sheriff in Pictou county. Nova Scotia, has been held by members of the 
Harris family since the early settlement of the province. 

Mr. Munsie received his early education in his native county, and in 
his early years learned the pattern-maker's trade there. He came west to 
San Francisco in 1874 and for the following four years worked at his trade 
there. In 1878 he entered into an engagement with Mr. Joseph Spratt by 
which he went to Victoria and assisted in the opening of a stove manufactory 
in that city, and for six years he was actively associated with Mr. Spratt in 
the manufacture of stoves. In 1884 he entered into a partnership with Mr. 
Fred Carne, and until 1893 they were engaged in the grocery and produce 
business. In the meantime he and his partner had become interested in the 
sealing business, and it is to the credit of Mr. Munsie that he brought out 
from Nova Scotia the " Pathfinder " which was the first schooner to come 
around Cape Horn to engage in the sealing industry from British Columbia. 
They later became the owners of several schooners and carried on the enter- 
prise in an extensive manner. Two of their schooners were seized by the 
Americans during the Behring sea troubles, and this was one of the acts which 
led to serious complications between the governments of England and the 
United States, and which were finally settled by arbitration by the Paris trib- 
unal, at which time Mr. Munsie and his partner were awarded damages for 



364 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the seizure of their ships. They at one time had six schooners employed in 
the seal fisheries. The sealing industries at Victoria are now consolidated 
and carried on as the Victoria Sealing Company, of which Mr. Munsie is a 
stockholder and director. 

In 1 891 he became a member of the Shawnagan Lake Lumber Com- 
pany, whose sawmill is situated at Shawnagan lake and their lumber yards 
in Victoria. He is a stockholder and the secretary of this company. He 
was one of the organizers of the Ladysmith Lumber Company, which has a 
mill at Ladysmith, and he is president of this company. Mr. Munsie in con- 
nection with Mr. C. F. Todd built the first salmon traps at or near Victoria, 
and this is an enterprise which bids fair to become one of great importance 
to this city. 

Mr. Munsie was married in 1870 to Miss Catherine Dunn, a native of 
Wallace, Nova Scotia. He is an active member of the board of trade of 
his city, and in countless ways identifies his efforts with the best welfare 
and progress of the city. 

HON. ROBERT FRANCIS GREEN. 

Hon. Robert Francis Green, chief commissioner of lands and works of 
the province of British Columbia, was born in Pittsburg, Ontario, on the 
14th of November. 1861, his parents being Benjamin and Rebecca (Lep- 
sett) Green. The family is of Irish lineage and the father was born in 
West Meath county, Ireland, whence he emigrated to Canada in 1835, set- 
tling first in Quebec. There he was actively engaged in the grain and prod- 
uce business and in 1840 he removed to Ontario, while later he came to 
British Columbia, becoming a pioneer and representative business man of 
these various districts. He died at Caswell in the eighty-first year of his 
age, while his wife, who was also a native of county West Meath, Ireland, 
departed this life in Ontario. They were devoted members of the Methodist 
church, taking an active and interested part in the various departments of 
church work. 

Robert Francis Green is indebted to the public school system of On- 
tario for the educational privileges which he enjoyed. He engaged in 
merchandising at Hastings and was elected first mayor of Caswell in 1893. 
In fact, he was one of the organizers of the city and aided in framing its 
municipal government and policy. In 1894 he was defeated for the office 
of chief executive of the new city, but in 1896 and 1897 he was again elected, 
discharging his duties in a prompt, business-like and capable manner. In 
1898 he became a candidate for the local house and so efficiently served in 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 366 

that capacity that he was re-elected in 1900 and continued in the position 
until October, 1903, when he was elected for a third term. During his 
first term in the house he supported the Semlin party and at his second elec- 
tion he joined the Dominion party in opposition to the Martin party. He 
was in favor of the Dunsnier government during the latter part of its exist- 
ence and also of the Prior government and under the last named was de- 
feated. He then accepted the office of minister of mines under Richard Mc- 
Bride, premier, and filled the office for several months, after which he engaged 
Avith the department of lands and works and is now with intense and well 
directed energy promoting the interests of the province in this important 
department. He is interested in several mining enterprises and is deeply 
concerned in the development of the great natural resources of the province, 
knowing that there is a vast field for profitable labor here. His own efforts 
have contributed in substantial measure to what has already been done in 
reclaiming the district and its splendid possibilities for the uses of the white 
race and for the advancement of broader civilization here. 

In 1889 Mr. Green was married to Miss Celia McDaniel, a native of 
Erie, Pennsylvania, and a daughter of Percy McDaniel, now deceased, a 
representative of an old American family. They have two children in Brit- 
ish Columbia, William H. and Celia R. Mr. Green is prominent in Ma- 
sonry, having attained the thirty-second degree of the Scottish rite, while he 
is also a member of the Mystic Shrine. Although he has been prominent and 
influential in public affairs his life accomplishments but represent the result 
of the fit utilization of the innate talent which is his and the directing of his 
efforts in these lines where mature judgment and rare discrimination lead 
the way. There is in him a weight of character, a native sagacity, a far- 
seeing judgment and a fidelity of purpose that command the respect of all. 
A man -of indomitable enterprise and fidelity, he has carved his name deeply 
in the record of the political and commercial history of the province which . 
owes not a little of the advancement to his efforts. 

HON. ROBERT GARNETT TATLOW. 

Hon. Robert Garnett Tatlow, whose official record confers honor upon 
the province that has honored him and who as minister of finance is now 
occupying a position in the portfolio of British Columbia, was born in Scawa, 
county Down, Ireland, on the 6th of September, 1855. Back of him is an 
ancestry honorable and distinguished. For many generations the family 
resided on the Emerald Isle and a large number of its representatives fol- 



366 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

lowed professional pursuits, some attaining marked prominence and suc- 
cess therein. 

Mr. Tatlow was educated in England, and in 1879 came to British 
Columbia with Major Strange, being a member of Battery B. He was on 
a tour of inspection of tlie defences but became enamored with the country 
and decided to remain, allying his interests with the great northwest whose 
rapid and wonderful development is almost miraculous, so great has been 
the growth of population and so quick the introduction of all the industries 
and improvements of the older east. Mr. Tatlow came to Victoria as private 
secretary to Hon. A. N. Richards, who was then lieutenant governor of 
British Columbia. Mr. Tatlow remained in that position until the termina- 
tion of his official duties and was then appointed secretary to Lieutenant C. 
F. Cornwall, continuing with him until 1886. He then went to Vancouver 
to represent a syndicate that owned a large portion of the town site of that 
rapidly growing city and Mr. Tatlow became one of the first builders of a 
residence there. His first home, however, was destroyed by fire, but later 
he rebuilt. He remained in Vancouver, engaged in various financial enter- 
prises and was connected with the Stanley Park firm for fifteen years. All 
of the improvements of that magnificent park were made under his man- 
agement and in the work he took a special pleasure and pride. 

On the 4th of June, 1903, Mr. Tatlow was appointed to his present 
position as minister of finance for the province by the Hon. Richard Mc- 
Bridge, premier of British Columbia. He has always been a Conservative 
in politics and has been actively connected with his party organization for 
years, doing everything in his power to promote its growth and insure its 
success. He was married in 1893 to Miss Elizabeth Combie, a daughter 
of J. H. Combie, chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railroad. She is 
a native of Quebec and is of Irish ancestry. There are three children born 
unto Mr. and Mrs. Tatlow : John, Garnet Keneth and Helen, all natives of 
the province. Theirs is a beautiful home in Vancouver and they are mem- 
bers of the Church of England, where their many excellent personal traits 
have gained them a social prominence, giving them entree into the best soci- 
ety of Vancouver. 

GEORGE HERBERT MANCHESTER, M. D. 

Dr. George Herbert Manchester, medical superintendent of the Public 
Hospital for the Insane in the province of British Columbia, has proved him- 
self the right man in the right place, and as the medical head of a great hu- 
mane institution has been a public benefactor and a power for individual bet- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 367 

terment and uplift in the case of the patients under his charge. Almost his 
entire experience in medical practice since leaving the university has been 
confined to work among the insane and feeble-minded, and he has gained an 
indisputably high rank as an alienist, and, what is of equal importance in his 
present office, has powers of influence and control over his patients which 
have given him great success and efficiency in the direction of his duties, and 
it can be fairly stated that the insane hospital has never been in a better con- 
dition than under the present regime. 

Dr. Manchester, a descendant of an old and prominent English-Canadian 
family, was born in the city of Ottawa May 13, 1872. His great-grand- 
father, William J. Manchester, a native of England, emigrated to Philadel- 
phia, thence to the province of Quebec, where he had large interests as a lum- 
berman. William Jacob Manchester, the grandfather, was born in the latter 
province at Rawdon, near Montreal, but has spent most of his life in western 
Ontario, where he still lives; being in his eighty-seventh year. His son, 
David Manchester, the father of the doctor, was born at Rawdon in 1840, 
and married Miss Mary Ann Taylor, who was born in 1839 in Napean, Ot- 
tawa. The father has followed merchant tailoring a large part of his career, 
being now the oldest merchant tailor in Ottawa. He has also been a very 
successful man in other lines. He was one of the -first white men to locate 
on the Manitoulin Island, Ontario, where he had a large amount of govern- 
ment land and was engaged in lumbering, employing several ships in this 
business. He is now sixty-five years of age, and his career has been honor- 
able and successful throughout. His son, David L., is now in the merchant 
tailoring business at Montreal. Dr. Manchester was a child when his mother 
died. She was also of Irish ancestry, and her father, Richard Taylor, Esq., 
was for many years an Irish justice of the peace. 

Dr. Manchester received his literary education at Ottawa, in the Ottawa 
Collegiate Institute and in Albert College, where he took the liberal arts 
course. His medical course was taken at the famous McGill University, 
where he received his degree of M. D. in 1894. His standing as a student 
had been high, and at his graduation he was appointed house surgeon in the 
Montreal General Hospital, where he remained one year. He then became 
assistant superintendent of the hospital for the insane at Verdun, a suburb 
of Montreal. He later spent a year of study in general medicine in London, 
England. While he was abroad the British Columbia government seemed to 
be on the point of losing their superintendent of the hospital for the insane 
by death from blood poisoning, and Dr. Manchester was accordingly called 
to take his place. On his arrival in the province he found the superintendent 



368 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

already recovering, but he was retained for two years as assistant superin- 
tendent, and this was a period of professional growth and acquirement of 
valuable experience on the part of Dr. Manchester, for he had the benefit of 
the knowledge and practice of his superior and was thoroughly equipped for 
the discharge of his official duties when the superintendent was retired on a 
pension and turned over his work to Dr. Manchester. The latter had also, 
while at Montreal, enjoyed the mature wisdom and experience of Dr. Burgess, 
who' for thirty years has given his attention to mental afflictions and is one 
of the most eminent alienists on the continent. Dr. Burgess's next assistant, 
Dr. Manchester's successor in Verdun, is now superintendent in the hospital 
for the insane at St. Johns, New Brunswick, manifesting the fact that Dr. 
Burgess is regarded as an adequate teacher in the field of alienism throughout 
Canada. Since taking entire charge of British Columbia hospital he has ef- 
fected many improvements, the grounds and the property are in fine condi- 
tion, and it is an abiding ambition with him to bring about many other addi- 
tions and changes for the better, so as to keep this hospital in the front rank 
of institutions of its kind. He desires especially to introduce better appli- 
ances for the comfort of the patients. Many of the inmates have been dis- 
charged permanently cured, and many others have been in large measure re- 
stored, so that Dr. Manchester may take much pride in his record during the 
last few years. During his superintendency the number of patients has 
doubled, but he is pleased to be able to state that the proportion of insane 
is very much less in British Columbia than in other parts of Canada or in the 
States. And it may be added that the general condition of the Public Hos- 
pital for the Insane is better noAv than it has ever been at any other period in 
its history. Dr. Manchester gives his whole time and attention to the duties 
of his position, and his work, so important to this province, has gained high 
recognition in many other parts of the country. 

Dr. Manchester was married in 1899 to Mrs. Victoria Orr, who was 
born near Picton, Ontario, a daughter of William Keys, Esq., and she has 
two sons. The doctor and his wife are members of the Methodist church, 
and are held in high esteem in the social circles of New Westminster. 

HENRY FRY MacLEOD. 

Henry Fry MacLeod, district registrar of lands for east and west 
Kootenay and a resident of Nelson, was born in York county, Ontario. 
October 29, 1868, his parents being Norman Tor and Margaret (Fry) Mac- 
Leod, both of whom are deceased. His early education was acquired in the 
public schools and he advanced through successive grades until he l^ecame 



BRITISH COLUMBIA . 369 

a high school student in Ontario. He also received private instructions from 
a clergyman. He took up the study of law in Toronto under the direction 
of C. C. Robinson and was also a student in the law office of G. Filmore 
Cane, being admitted to the bar in 1892. He began the practice of his chosen 
profession in Toronto and remained there until 1898, when he came to Nel- 
son, British Columbia. Here he engaged in the practice of law for six 
months with the firm of Galliher &amp; Wilson and was licensed to practice in 
December, 1898. He then continued with the firm mentioned until the 
close of the year 1900, when he was appointed district registrar of lands 
for east and west Kootenay, which position he still occupies, having dis- 
charged its duties with promptness and fidelity. 

CAPTAIN GEORGE PITTENDRIGH. 

Captain George Pittendrigh, whose career as a gallant soldier of the 
crown and later as a prominent man of affairs and active in tlie public life 
of British Columbia is deserving of more than passing mention, is an old 
resident of New Westminster, having come here over thirty years ago. 
Now when past the age of three score and ten, with the battles of life already 
fought, he enjoys that deep respect and veneration which come to the vet- 
eran who has made a brave and successful fight whether in actual war or in 
the struggles of civic affairs. 

Born in London in 1831, a son of George and Sarah Pittendrigh, natives 
of Essex, he comes of an old and substantial English family, whose record 
for usefulness and honor goes back several generations. His grandfather 
was a soldier in the royal artillery, serving in the struggle with the colonies 
and being severely wounded at Bunker's Hill. He later became superin- 
tendent of the royal powder mills at Waltham Abbey, and retired at the 
age of sixty-three. He was born in Adair, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Cap- 
tain Pittendrigh's father was connected with the civil service in London. 

The captain was educated in the private schools and under the tuition 
of the Rev. Thomas Mason at Ipswich. In 1844, when fifteen years old, 
he left school and entered the Sixty-third Foot Infantry, with which he 
served for many years up to and through the Crimean war. Captain Pit- 
tendrigh fought with the allied forces against Russia at the battles of the Alma, 
Balaklava, Inkerman and in the siege of Sebastopol, and with becoming 
pride he still wears the Turkish and Crimean war medals, with clasps de- 
noting the Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman and Sebastopol. He served at Scu- 
tari in the Bosphorus Command, as provost marshal for the latter part of the 
war. On his return home after this memorable campaign he was appointed 



370 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

on the staff of the Depot Battahon at Chichester. In 1857 he was appointed 
to the Second Battahon of the " Buffs " Regiment. On his retirement in 
1874 the officers of the battahon showed their appreciation of this gallant 
soldier by presenting him with a handsome table clock with suitable in- 
scriptions, which he treasures as a memorial of his long military service 
so replete with associations and experiences. 

Captain Pittendrigh arrived in British Columbia in June, 1874. He 
took up about seven hundred acres of land, with the intention of engaging 
in ranching, but after a year he found that did not suit him, and he was 
then appointed assistant Indian agent at New Westminster for the New 
Westminster district. In 1877 he conducted an office as notary public, con- 
veyancer, and he served for some years as a justice of the peace. In 1894 
he was appointed stipendiary magistrate, which he still holds, and in 1895 
judge of the small debts court. He has served as coroner since 1892. He 
could not entirely dissociate himself from military affairs after coming to 
this province, and in 1877 he reorganized the old Seymour Artillery, which 
was formed into the British Columbia Provincial Artillery, No. i Battery, 
of which he was made the commander. Captain Pittendrigh is one of the 
oldest Masons in the province, having joined that order on December 12, 
1856. 

Captain Pittendrigh was first married in 1849, to Miss Caroline Bry- 
ant, a native of England. Six children were born of this union, but Emily 
J., the widow of Judge Haines, is the only survivor. In 1863, while sta- 
tioned at Gibraltar, Captain Pittendrigh married Maria Rosaria Morsiciana 
Blount, who was born at Gibraltar, of English parentage. Of this second 
marriage there were fourteen children, and eleven of them are still living. 
Mrs. Pittendrigh died at New Westminster in 1892. 

SIDNEY S. OPPENHEIMER, M. D. 

It is the young men who are winning notable success in the profes- 
sions and among the abler representatives of the medical fraternity in Green- 
wood is Dr. Sidney S. Oppenheimer, one of the native sons of British Colum- 
bia, his birth having occurred in Yale, February 12, 1873. His parents 
are Isaac and Celia (Sidenbach) Oppenheimer, old residents of Vancouver, 
now residing in New Orleans, Louisiana. His youth was spent in his par- 
ents' home, and as a student in the public and high schools of Victoria and 
Vancouver he mastered the common branches of English learning and was 
also tutored by Mr. Tucker, of Montreal, a brother of the Rev. Tucker, of 
Vancouver. Thus well qualified to enter upon the study of medicine he pur- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 371 

sued a full course in medicine in McGill University of Montreal and was 
graduated with the class of 1898. During six years he practiced in Green- 
wood, his patronage constantly growing in volume and importance. When 
he had been located here for six months he entered into partnership with 
R. W. Jakes, with whom he continued for three years, when he took charge 
of the first hospital established in Greenwood. He has since practiced alone 
and now numbers among his patrons many of the best families of this city, 
for he has fully demonstrated his ability to cope with the intricate problems 
that continually confront the physician and surgeon. He keeps in touch with 
the advanced thought of the medical fraternity and with the most modern 
methods and success has attended him in his efforts. He is dominion med- 
ical health officer for the boundary, and medical health officer for the city 
of Greenwood. Like many residents of British Columbia he has made in- 
vestment in mining property. Fraternally he is connected with Greenwood 
Lodge No. 29, K. P. 

DAVID ROBSON. 

David Robson, until lately government agent and mining recorder and 
assistant commissioner of lands and works for New Westminster district, 
is a well known old-time resident of New Westminster, and he has been more 
or less permanently identified with the welfare of this province since the 
spring of 1862. He is a man of broad character, liberal-minded, and fol- 
lows the best traditions and emulates the worthy careers of a family of 
Robsons who have proved themselves important factors in public and pri- 
vate affairs wherever their interests and home have been centered. 

Mr. David Robson was born in Perth, Ontario, July 21, 1840. His 
father, John Robson, was born in Scotland, whence, as a single young 
man, he emigrated to Canada, and in Perth was married to Mrs. Euphemia 
Richardson Thompson, a widow lady with two children. She and Mr. 
John Robson became the parents of sixteen children, all but three of whom 
attained maturity. The father, who was a valued member and an elder 
in the Presbyterian church and who reared his family to excellent ideals 
and honest careers, died at the age of sixty-five, and the mother passed 
away when sixty-three years old. There are three sons and three daugh- 
ters of this family still living. The Rev. Ebenezer Robson, D. D., is a 
resident of Mount Pleasant, Vancouver. Mrs. T. D. Pearson, residing in 
New Westminster, is the wife of a retired clergyman of the Methodist 
Episcopal church. Perhaps the best known member of the family in Brit- 
ish Columbia was John Robson, who came to the province in i860, was a 



372 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

journalist by profession, was elected to the local legislature and later ht-» 
came premier of British Columbia, and was a man of high intellectual at- 
tainments and held in high esteem wherever known. He died in 1892, leav- 
ing his widow, Mrs. Susie Robson and one daughter, who is now the wife 
of Joseph Hunter, a prominent citizen of Victoria. 

Mr. David Robson was educated in the common and grammar schools 
of Sarnia, Ontario, and in 1870 graduated with the degree of A. B. in the arts 
course at Victoria University in Toronto. He then established the Bulletin 
at Collingwood, Ontario, a paper which he edited and published for eleven 
years. He then returned to New Westminster and became assistant to his 
brother, Hon. John Robson, in conducting the Columbian. This was for- 
merly the Pacific Herald, published as a semi-weekly, and the Robson broth- 
ers bought it from Mr. John C. Brown. On his brother's election to the legis- 
lature, Mr. Robson continued the publication of the Colmnbian, giving it a 
daily edition, and as a most successful independent paper it remained under 
his control until 1885. He then sold it and accepted the position of city clerk 
of New Westminster, and after a long period of service resigned this office in 
1896 to accept his place in the government service. In 1888 he was elected 
secretary of the New Westminster Board of Trade, and as such served until 
1902. He was also an alderman during 1897-98, and has always done every- 
thing in his power to build up the best interests of his city and province. 

In 1876 Mr. Robson was married to Miss Emma Ida Henry, a native of 
Chatham, Ontario, and they have three children : Charles Edgar, born in 
Collingwood, is a citizen of San Francisco ; Gertrude Estelle is the wife of 
Norman Williams, a lawyer of Los Angeles ; John Stanley is at home, at- 
tending Columbia College. The family are members of the Methodist 
church. They have one of New Westminster's comfortable homes, and en- 
joy the esteem of all their fellow citizens. 

PROFESSOR EDWARD ODLUM. 

Professor Edward Odium, lecturer, writer and capitalist of Vancouver, 
is one of the promoters of the city's upbuilding, and with firm faith in a 
splendid future for its district he has labored untiringly and efficiently to 
advance the interests of the city along lines contributing to its material prog- 
ress, its beauty, its social, political and intellectual advancement. A mind 
of wide compass and of ready recognition of possibilities has enabled him to 
look beyond the exigencies of the moment to the opportunities of the future 
and his labors have been for future good as well as immediate benefit. 

Professor Odium came to British Columbia in 1889. He was born in

■1 : V 

A I t', ii ■. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 373 

Tullamore, Peel county, Ontario, on the 27th of November, 1850. He rep- 
resents one of the old families of the mother country, the ancestry being 
traced back in England to the year 1690, when authentic records give account 
of four brothers, officers of the British army, who went to Ireland with King 
William. Abraham Odium, grandfather of Professor Odium, was born in 
Ireland and he, too, represented the military interests of his country as an 
officer and fought under the Duke of Wellington. Subsequently he settled 
on Guernsey Island, and in 1820 he chartered a ship and brought his family 
to America, his destination being Quebec. John Odium, father of Professor 
Odium, was of the party, and both he and the grandfather were soldiers of 
the war of 1837. John Odium followed the occupation of farming and 
lived an upright, honorable life in consistent harmony with his professions 
as a member of the Church of England. He married Miss Margaret Mc- 
Kenzie, who' was of Scotch descent, but was born in county Tyrone, Ireland. 
They had nine children, seven of whom are living. The father has attained 
the venerable age of eighty-four years and resides in Lucknow, Bruce county, 
Ontario. His wife departed this life in 1892, in the seventieth year of her 
age. 

Professor Odium supplemented his early educational privileges by study 
in the Collegiate Institute at Cobourg, Ontario, and graduated from the Vic- 
toria University, that institution conferring upon him in recognition of work 
done the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts and Bachelor of Science. 
He then traveled for the Canadian Government for two years in England, 
Wales, Scotland, Ireland and the Orkney islands, lecturing and presenting 
to the people of Great Britain the great advantages and resources of Canada 
and thus inducing emigration. Subsequently he returned to the new world 
and made his way to the Cariboo district of British Columbia, where he was 
engaged in gold mining, representing a large company. He found, however, 
after considerable work had been done, that the output of the mines would 
not be sufficient to meet the heavy expense of its operation and he advised its 
abandonment. He prepared for the British Columbian government a report 
on the description of the economic woods of the province, and as a repre- 
sentative of the same government he went to Manitoba and the older districts 
of Canada to report upon the subject of education in the province and to 
induce the setting aside of government lands for educational purposes. This 
subject is still under consideration. 

Professor Odium has devoted much of his life to the work of public 
instruction as teacher, lecturer or writer. He was for some years president 
of a college in Tokio, Japan, having six hundred students and fourteen pro- 



374 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

fessors and tutors under his direction, and his special effort was along the 
line of instruction in science and the classics. While in Japan Professor 
Odium was called upon to mourn the loss of his wife, whose death resulted 
from malaria and pneumonia. This caused him to leave that country and 
he afterward traveled in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, but 
after visiting various sections of the country he gave Vancouver his prefer- 
ence as a place of residence and as the place of investment. He, therefore, 
purchased city property and has never had occasion to regret his determina- 
tion in tliis direction, for the rapid growth and development of Vancouver 
has greatly promoted property values, and Professor Odium has therefore 
realized a splendid financial return. He has both built and purchased houses 
in Vancouver and is still the owner of extensive property interests here. His 
attention is now largely given to the supervision of his realty, for having 
spent nineteen years in educational work he decided to retire from that field 
of activity and has since declined various offers of college professorships. 
In addition to the care of his property, however, he is writing for the news- 
papers on the subject of " Who are the Japanese and Who are the Saxons ? " 
letters which have received favorable comment and which show wide research 
and ability. 

In 1892 Professor Odium was elected alderman of Vancouver, receiving 
the largest vote ever cast in the city. It was after this term of service that 
he traveled for the government in Great Britain, and in January, 1904, he 
was again elected to the office of alderman. Progress and patriotism might 
well be termed the keynote of his character, and these have been strongly 
manifest in his official service on the aldermanic lx&gt;ard. In all community 
affairs tending to elevate mankind and promote the interests of the city he 
is deeply interested, and as the champion of many progressive measures his 
value in citizenship has long since been proven. He is an active member of 
the Princess Street Methodist church, and he is chairman of the Carnegie 
public library. 

Professor Odium was married in 1877 to Miss Mary Elvira Powell, a 
native of Ontario, descended from a family of United Empire loyalists of 
English origin. The first of the name in America had located in what is 
now the United States, but when the American Revolution was inaugurated 
they were loyal to the king and removed to Canada. Professor and Mrs. 
Odium became the parents of four sons, Edward Farady, Victor Wentworth, 
Garnet McKenzie and Joseph Wellesly. The eldest is head bookkeeper for 
Thomson Brothers, the second is city editor for the Daily World of Van- 
couver, and the fourth is a clerk in one of the city stores. Three served in 



BRITISH COLUMBIA • 375 

the Boer war in South Africa, the youngest being but sixteen years of age 
when he entered the army and the eldest twenty-one years of age. They 
fought in many of the battles, and at the end of a year's service returned to 
Canada, entering the army here as lieutenants, one being but seventeen years 
of age and the other twenty-one years. This service in behalf of their 
country was highly creditable and commendable. Professor Odium and his 
father served in the army during the Fenian war, so that there is no lack of 
loyalty or patriotism in the family. They are a family of military men as 
well as excellent private citizens. 

Professor Odium is identified with various organizations for intellectual 
advancement and scientific research. He has been a member of the Austra- 
lian Science Association and of the Royal Association of Japan. He be- 
longed to the British Science Association both in Canada and Great Britain, 
and has been an active and valued representative of these organizations, pre- 
paring and reading many papers at their meetings. The chief work of his 
life during the past thirty-live years may be termed investigation along the 
line of theistic science — the study of God in nature. He is now president 
of the Art &amp; Science Association of Vancouver. It would be almost tauto- 
logical in this connection to enter into any series of statements showing him 
to be a man of broad mind and strong native talents which educational culture 
has developed. It might well be said of him, as it was said of an eminent 
man of old, that he has done things worthy to be written and that he has 
written things worthy to be read, and by his life has contributed to the wel- 
fare of his province and the happiness of mankind. 

PAULUS M. IRVING. 

Paulus M. Irving, one of the judges of the supreme court of the prov- 
ince of British Columbia with residence in Victoria, came to the province in 
February, 1882. He is a native of Hamilton, Ontario, torn on the 3d of 
April, 1857. His father was ^milius Irving, K. C, and his mother was 
Miss Augusta Louise Gugy, a native of Quebec. The father was very prom- 
inent in legal circles, being for many years treasurer of the Law Society of 
Upper Canada. 

Judge Irving was educated in Trinity College school at Port Hope, and 
in Trinity College of Toronto, Canada, where he took the degree of Bachelor 
of Arts in 1877 and Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa in 1900. Soon after- 
ward he entered upon the practice of his profession in Victoria, becoming a 
partner of Mr. Ebberts, late attorney general. Judge Irving served as deputy 
attorney general for several years, after which he entered into partnership 



376 • BRITISH COLUMBIA 

with Mr. Bodwell, and this relation was maintained up to the time when he 
was appointed to the supreme court bench in 1897. 

In 1883 Mr. Irving was united in marriage to Miss Diana Hamley, a 
daughter of Hon. W. Hamley, of Victoria. 

F. T. UNDERHILL, F. R. C. S., D. P. H. 

For seven years a successful practicing physician of Vancouver, and the 
present efficient health officer, Dr. Underhill in his official capacity is doing 
a splendid service for the city. He was born in Staffordshire, England, on 
the 19th of June, 1858, descended from a long line of English ancestors who 
were prominent members of the medical profession. His paternal grand- 
father spent his entire life in the successful practice of medicine and surgery, 
and his son, William Lees Underhill, father of Dr. F. T. Underhill, was also 
a life-long practitioner. He was also prominent in community interests and 
was a justice of the peace in his county for over forty years. He married 
Miss Emily Roe, a daughter of Dr. William Roe, who had the honor of 
being the court physician of William the Fourth, king of England. She 
was of Scotch and Irish ancestry. Dr. William L. Underhill died in 1894, 
at the age of eighty-four years, and his wife departed this life in the sixty- 
seventh year of her age. They had seven children and there was a former 
marriage by which there were two children. Eight of the number are now 
living, one being a lawyer, one a minister and six physicians — all eminent in 
their professions. Only two are in British Columbia, the brother of . Dr. 
Underhill being the Rev. Harold Underhill, who is rector of St. Paul's 
church, in Victoria. 

Dr. Underhill, of Vancouver, acquired his education in Edinburgh, Scot- 
land, winning his medical degree there, and afterward practiced his profes- 
sion as a family physician in South Stafford until 1894. He then spent 
three years at Mission, British Columbia, and returned to Edinburgh to ob- 
tain his D. P. H., and in 1897, on his return he established an office in Vancou- 
ver, where he has since been very successful as a practitioner of medicine 
and surgery. His methods are modern, he keeping in touch with the advanced 
thought of the day and informing himself thoroughly concerning every 
new idea or invention which he believes will prove of value in eradicating or 
checking disease. The board of aldermen of Vancouver in order to increase 
the efficiency of the health department of the city passed a law for the pur- 
pose and appointed Dr. Underhill to fill that important office of city health 
officer. He is now giving his entire attention to this important work. His 
appointment was dated August i, 1904, and he is the first officer whose duty 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 377 

it has been to give his entire attention and time to the heahh conditions of 
Vancouver. One of the principal tasks which devolves upon him is the 
stamping out of infectious diseases such as diphtheria, scarlet fever and 
measles. He takes a deep interest in the work of his position and is regarded 
by the public as the right man in the right place. For eighteen years he 
served in the Volunteers, retiring with the rank of major. 

Dr. Underbill was married in 1885 to Miss Beatrice Alice Murial, a 
native of Norfolk, England, and a daughter of Dr. Evans Murial. They 
have six sons and five daughters, namely: Murial Beatrice, Reginald, Ella 
Marg-aretta, Frederick Clare, James Theodore, Charles Bertram, William 
Leslie Larube, Sybil Mary, Enid, Helen and William. The doctor has 
erected a delightful residence at the corner of Broughton and Barkley 
streets, and they have surrounded their home with many beautiful flowers, 
shrubs and vines, which indicate the refined and cultured taste of the family. 
The parents and children are communicants of the Church of England, hold- 
ing membership in the Catholic Apostolic church. The social prominence 
of the family is indicated by the hospitality which is so freely accorded 
them in the best homes of the city, while Dr. Underbill's ability, in the line 
of his profession is acknowledged by his fellow practitioners and the public 
at large, all uniting in bearing testimony to his skill and learning in practice 
and his genuine personal worth. 

FREDERICK JOHN FULTON. 

Frederick John Fulton, member of the provincial parliament from the 
North riding of Yale district, prominently active in Conservative politics, 
and for the past sixteen years a leading representative of the bar of British 
Columbia, was born in Northumberland, England, December 8, 1862. His 
father, Alexander Fulton, of Scotch descent, and his mother, Barbara (Gib- 
son) Fulton, of English lineage, are both living in- England, and three 
brothers and three sisters complete the family. 

Educated in the Havershan grammar school and later at Cambridge 
University, from which he graduated in 1883, Mr. Fulton, on leaving school, 
was articled to a solicitor and after a thorough course of legal studies was 
admitted as a solicitor in London in 1887. In August of the same year 
crossing the Atlantic to the new w^orld, he located at Hamilton, Ontario, and 
for two years was with the law firm of T. C. Haslett. He came to British 
Columbia in August, 1889, and in the following October took up active 
practice at Kamloops, which has been the center of his successful efforts to 
the present time.

He was official administrator and judge of the court of revision for the 
Yale district from 1891 to 1900, and in the latter year successfully contested 
the North riding of Yale district and was returned by a good majority as 
member of the provincial parliament, in which his chief public services have 
since been rendered in a most public-spirited and effective manner. He was 
appointed a queen's councillor in 1901, re-elected in October, 1903, appointed 
president of the council without portfolio in October, 1903, and provincial 
secretary and minister of education in May, 1904, which latter position he 
still holds. Mr. Fulton is an attendant of the Church of England. 

WILLIAM J. BOWSER, LL. B., K. C, M. P. P. 

William John Bowser, a prominent barrister of Vancouver, who has 
won prominence as a practitioner in the department of criminal law, is a na- 
tive of New Brunswick, his birth having occurred in Rexton, in December, 
1867. He is of English and Scotch lineage. His paternal grandfather, 
John Bowser, a native of England, emigrated to New Brunswick and was a 
judge there for many years. His son, William Bowser, father of William 
J. Bowser, was born in New Brunswick and became a merchant there. He 
married Miss Margaret Gordon, a lady of Scotch lineage. He was a mem- 
ber of the Church of England and she of the Presbyterian faith. His death 
occurred when he was in the seventieth year of his age, and his wife, still 
surviving him, is now in her sixty-eighth year. They were the parents of 
eight children, of whom four are living: Frank Bowser and William J. 
Bowser being residents of British Columbia. The former occupies a position 
in the custom house in Vancouver. 

William J. Bowser, having acquired a knowledge of the elementary 
branches of learning, continued his education in Allison Academy and in 
Delhouse University, at Halifax. When he had completed a two years' 
course in the arts he eAtered the law department and was graduated with the 
degree of Bachelor of Laws in the class of 1890. He was then admitted to 
the bar of New Brunswick and has since devoted his energies to the practice 
of his chosen profession. 

Mr. Bowser came to Vancouver in 1891, and was at once admitted to the 
bar of the province. Opening an office, he has since been at the head of his 
firm and has enjoyed a large general practice, taking especial interest in 
criminal law. He was crown prosecutor for three years, and has been re- 
tained on nearly all the murder cases that have been tried in the courts of 
Vancouver. He is very thorough and painstaking in the preparation of 
his cases, is logical in argument, forceful in his presentation of a cause and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 379 

his oratory as well as his sound reasoning enables him to gain the verdict 
desired. In no profession does success and advancement depend more largely 
upon individual merit, and that he stands to-day as one of the leading rep- 
resentatives of the legal profession is due to his ability and thorough under- 
standing of the principles, of jurisprudence. In 1900 Mr. Bowser was gazetted 
a Queen's Counsel. 

In 1896 Mr. Bowser was married to Miss Lorinda Doherty, a native 
of New Brunswick. He is a member of the Masonic fraternity, having 
joined that organization in 1895. He belongs to Mount Hermon Lodge and 
has always been an interested student of Masonry, its tenets and teachings, 
while in- his life he has exemplified the beneficent spirit of the craft. He has 
passed all the chairs in the blue lodge and has held the highest office in the 
grand lodge of the province. His promotion was very rapid and well earned, 
and he is now most capably filling the high position of Grand Master of the 
Grand Lodge, being the youngest incumbent ever in the office. He is also' a 
Royal Arch Mason. 

Mr. Bowser has been an active participant in the politics of the province, 
and in 1896 was a Conservative candidate for the Dominion parliament. In 
1898 he stood for the provincial parliament, but the whole ticket was de- 
feated. He has taken a very active part in the campaign and has been an 
effective speaker in behalf of the principles which he advocates, his logical 
argimients and clear presentation of his cause never failing to make an im- 
press upon the minds of his auditors. In 1903 he was elected to the local 
legislature from the city of Vancouver as a supporter of the Conservative 
government. In religious faith a Presbyterian, his interest centers along 
those lines which he believes contributes to the material upbuilding and the 
social, political and intellectual advancement of the people at large, and he 
is a broad-minded man, having intimate knowledge of the great questions 
of the day which affect the general interests of society. 

ARCHIBALD BIRNIE MACKENZIE.

capability who are the leaders in public life and business activity and in 
Rossland Mr. Mackenzie occupies such a position. He is now engaged in 
the real estate and insurance business, also deals in coal and has mining in- 
terests. His attention is thus largely occupied and his business career is 
such as any man might be proud to possess for he never makes an engage- 
ment that he does not fill or incur an obligation that he has not met.

great northwest and came to the province, locating in New Westminster, 
where he turned his attention to the real estate and insurance business. 
There he remained until 1895, when he removed to Rossland and opened a

FREDERICK NORRIS. 

Frederick Norris, during the past thirty years of active connection with 
business afifairs, has acquired the reputation of being one of Victoria's most 
successful business men and the largest leather and trunk manufacturer in 
the province of British Columbia. He began his career by learning a trade 
and by his own persevering efforts advanced through the details to mastery 
and control of the workmanship of others, and in time built up a business 
which he can look upon with pride and which stands as an element of sub- 
stantial worth to the industrial and commercial importance of Victoria. 

Mr. Norris has lived in Victoria for forty years, and has known the 
city from its early days when it was his boyhood home. He was born in 
Toronto, Canada, November 15, 1852, and is of old English ancestry. His 
parents, William G. and Mary (Dean) Norris, were both born in England. 
The father came out to British Columbia with his eldest son, John T., in 
1862. He embarked in the hotel business on Yates street in Victoria, and for 
a number of years ran the old Pioneer Hotel, a hostelry well known to the 



382 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

older inhabitants. He later engaged in the hardware business and continued 
it on an extensive scale and with much success until his permanent retire- 
ment from active affairs. He is now living in the eighty-fifth year of his 
life. His life partner died in 1902, when eighty years old. They were the 
parents of nine children, and the four living are : John T., Frederick, Mary, 
now Mrs. L. G. McQuade, her husband's history appearing elsewhere in this 
work, and Louisa, the wife of C. I. Todd, one of Victoria's prominent busi- 
ness men, 

Mr. Frederick Norris was educated in Victoria, and when a boy began 
learning the harness-maker's trade and carriage trimming. He has since 
continued his activity along this line, but with constant progress and in- 
creasing success. He is now the proprietor of a large leather manufactory 
and trunk factory, and makes leather both for sale and for his own articles 
of manufacture. His trunks and harness and other leather products have 
gained an enviable reputation in this province, and his wholesale and retail 
business totals up to large amounts every year, and has not yet reached its 
high-water mark. 

He built and owns the three story structure in which his trunk factory 
is located, and is also owner of much other city property, besides his beautiful 
residence, which is a representative among the many charming homes for 
which the city of Victoria is noted. He owns farming lands in the province, 
and assisted in the organization of the Agricultural Society, in which he is 
a member of the executive board. 

Mr. Norris' wife is Mrs. Mary Ann (Elley) Norris. She was born in 
England. Their union has been blessed with three children. Frederick 
John, the eldest, is foreman in his father's harness factory. This son married 
Miss Allie Alfred, and they have two children. The: other son, H. L, is 
also connected with his father's business, and the daughter, Lottie Louise, 
is at home with her parents. Mr. Norris affiliates with the Independent 
Order of Odd Fellows, and he and the family adhere to the Church of Eng- 
land. 

MAJOR F. W. BOULTBEE. 

Major F. W. Boultbee, the second in command of the Sixth Regiment 
of Duke Connaught's Own Rifles, and one of Vancouver's representative 
citizens, arrived here in 1887 as a member of an engineering staff of the 
Canadian Pacific Railroad, who continued to serve in that capacity for a 
year. He is a native of Ancester, Ontario, born on the 23d of May, 1864, 
and is descended from an English family, tracing its ancestry back for many

generations in the mother country! His father, Washington Boultbee, was 
born at Baxtely Hill in Warwickshire in 1806 and in 1837 crossed the At- 
lantic to Ancester. which was then situated in the midst of a new and un- 
developed country, the work of improvement and progress having scarcely 
been begun in that district. He was a civil engineer and in the line of his 
profession continued to contribute in important and beneficial measure to the 
progress and upbuilding of that section of the Dominion in which he made 
his home. He married Miss Eliza Bourne, a native of Kent, England, who 
was born in 1828. They remained residents of Canada, the father passing 
away in 1875, in his sixty-ninth year, while the mother still survives, and is 
now in her seventy-sixth year. She is a communicant of the Church of 
England, to which Mr. Boultbee also belonged. He had improved a farni 
near Hamilton and there reared his family of ten children, of whom nine 
are still living, four being residents of Vancouver. 

Major Boultbee was educated in the city of Hamilton and when a youth 
of eighteen years he left home, going to Manitoba in 1882. He has since 
been dependent entirely upon his own resources, and whatever success he has 
achieved in life has come as the direct reward of his labor. There he was 
engaged in railroad surveying and he afterward entered the employ of the 
Canadian Pacific Railroad, being engaged in the construction of snow sheds 
for a year. Later he was connected with the Manitoba and Northwestern 
Railway Company for four years, and he came to Vancouver as a member of 
the engineering staff for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Subse- 
quently he turned his attention to the task of making the surveys for the 
city water works and since that time he has been continuously connected with 
the water works system of Vancouver, acting for the past twelve years as 
secretary of the board. 

Interested in military affairs. Major Boultbee joined the Winnipeg Field 
Battery in 1885, and served with that command as a gunner for a number 
of years. In 1894 he joined the Fifth Regiment of Artillery as a lieutenant, 
and was with that command until it became the Sixth Regiment of Duke 
Connaught's Own Rifles. He is now acting as major, being second in com- 
mand of the regiment. He has made a thorough study of drill and military 
tactics and takes much laudable pride in his regiment and its efficiency. It 
is composed of a representative body of men of the province and has won a 
most honorable name in military circles. Major Boultbee is a member of 
the Church of England and is prominent socially as well as in connection 
with municipal and military interests in Vancouver.

JOHN MOUNT LANGLEY. 

John Mount Langley, who for sixteen years was a member of the pro- 
vincial poHce force of British Columbia, and since 1900 has served as the 
chief of police of the city of Victoria, was born in this city, on the ist day 
of July, 1864. His father, James Langley, was a native of Litchfield, 
Staffordshire, England, and after arriving at years of maturity married 
Miss Annie Thain, a native of New Brunswick. In i860 James Langley 
came to British Columbia, and here engaged in the real estate business, buy- 
ing and selling property on his own account and also for others. Unto him 
and his wife were born three children, all natives of Victoria, namely : 
George, who is a druggist; John M., of this review; and Arthur, who is head 
bookkeeper for the Victoria Sealing Company. 

John M. langley pursued his education in the schools of Victoria and of 
San Francisco and remained in the latter city for some time. Returning 
to British Columbia he entered upon his business career here as a salesman 
in a drygoods store, and in 1883 he entered the public service in connection 
with the police department, being appointed deputy sheriff and sergeant of 
provincial police, in which capacity he remained until January, 1900. In 
1900 he was promoted to chief of the city of Victoria. During his long serv- 
ice on the police force he has become intimately acquainted with the entire 
country of British Columbia, his duties calling him to all parts of the prov- 
ince. He has been very active in the arrest of criminals and the suppression 
of crime by bringing law breakers to justice, and while he is feared by the 
disobedient and criminal classes he has the entire respect and confidence of 
those who hold themselves amenable to law. 

On the 22d of June, 1888, Mr. Langley was united in marriage to Miss 
Fannie Allott, a native daughter of Victoria and a daughter of Thomas Al- 
lott, who was of English ancestry and made his home in Victoria. Mr. 
and Mrs. Langley have a son whom they have named Stanley Pawson. They 
have a host of warm friends who hold them in high esteem and who greatly 
enjoy the generous and cordial hospitality of the Langley household. Mr. 
Langley is a charter member of the Native Sons of the Province. 

DR. GEORGE JOSEPH CHIPPERFIELD. 

Dr. George Joseph Chipperfield, of Revelstoke, is one of the prominent 
practitioners of the northwest. Combined with his native talent and natural 
qualifications for the arduous profession of medicine, are a most thorough 
preparation in the leading schools of this country and abroad and an exten- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 385 

sive practical experience duringf his actual professional career of some ten 
vears, so that he is a representative of the highest proficiency in medical' 
circles, and his career in Revelstoke promises to be one of great value and 
usefulness. 

Dr. Chipperfield is a native of London, England, where he was born 
.September 15, 1869. He attended school in the great world metropolis 
luitil he was twelve years old, and then, in 1882, his parents, William and 
Mary (Goodspeed) Chipperfield, emigrated to Manitoba, locating first at 
Brandon, and are now both living, respected and honored old people, in 
Winnipeg. After coming to this country the son attended Brandon Acad- 
emy, and when school days were over he learned by practical experience 
the drug business and at an early age passed an examination as a licensed 
druggist. He was in the drug business for six years. In 1891 he entered 
the Manitoba Medical College at Winnipeg, where he was graduated with 
the class of 1895, and for the following two years was engaged in prac- 
tice at Alexander, Manitoba. Being ambitious for further advancement 
and study, he went abroad and took a year of post-graduate work in Lon- 
don, Edinburgh and Glasgow. In these three famous centers of medical 
science he made a most creditable record in his studies, and at Edinburgh 
took the well known degrees of L. R. C. P. and L. R. C. S., and in Glas- 
gow his work was rewarded with an L. F. P. &amp; S. In 1898 he returned to 
Manitoba and for about five years was in active practice in Minnedosa, being 
in partnership with Dr. Roche, M. P. January i, 1903, he located at Revel- 
stoke. and has since advanced rapidly in the esteem of the people and in 
extent of practice. He is physician to Revelstoke Hospital. Fraternally 
he is affiliated with Prince of Wales Lodge No. 14, A. F. &amp; A. M., at 
Minnedosa. 

HARRY B. ABBOTT. 

Harry B. Abbott, who, having arrived in Vancouver before the place 
was named, has continuously made his home in the city and has taken a 
helpful part in its growth and upbuilding, is a native of Quebec, his birth hav- 
ing occurred in the town of Abbottsford, on the 14th of June, 1829. His 
ancestors resided in England through many generations. His father. Rev. 
Joseph Abbott, was born in that country, and whien he had reached adult age 
he married Miss Harriet Bradford, a native of Chatham, Quebec, and the 
daughter of Rev. Richard Bradford, who was one of the early clergymen of 
that part of the country. Rev. Abbott devoted his life to the work of the 
ministry and lived to be seventy-two years of age, while his wife died in 



386 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

her sixty-eighth year. They were the parents of three daughters and four 
■sons. 

Harry B. Abbott, now the only survivor of the family, pursued his edu- 
cation in the country schools and in McGill University, at Montreal, where he 
pursued a course in civil engineering. His entire life has been devoted to 
that calling. In his professional capacity he did much work for the Grand 
Trunk Railroad Company and other lines of the east and later he entered 
the service of the Canadian Pacific Railroad Company, with which he be- 
came connected during its construction to Vancouver, having charge of the 
building of eastern portions of the line till 1886. He was general superin- 
tendent from Vancouver as far as Donald, and in March, 1886, let the con- 
tract for clearing the townsite, at which time the population of the embryo 
city did not exceed five hundred. In the eighteen years which have since 
come and gone there has been a steady and substantial growth until Vancou- 
ver now numbers forty thousand inhabitants, making it the metropolis of 
British Columbia. He has continued in the service of this road to the present 
time and in connection with railroad construction he has contributed in large 
measure to the upbuilding and development of this part of the country. 

Mr. Abbott was married in 1868 to Miss Margaret Amelia Sicotte, a 
native of St. Hyacinth, Quebec, and they have had three children : John 
Lewis Graham Abbott, registrar of titles; Henry Hamilton Abbott, who is 
agent for the Canadian Pacific Railroad Company at Victoria; and Beatrice 
Amelia, now the wife of Osborne Plunkett, a solicitor in Vancouver. 

On one occasion Mr. Abbott was the candidate for the local parliament, 
but being taken seriously ill was unable to attend to the canvass and was 
defeated by eleven votes. In politics he has always been a Conservative. 
He and his wife have a nice home at 720 Georgia street and have many 
friends in the city. Abbott street in Vancouver was named in his honor. 
He has taken a deep interest in the almost phenomenal growth of Vancou- 
ver, has been the champion of many measures for general progress and as a 
man and citizen his position in the public regard is most enviable. 

SAMUEL NORTH. 

Samuel North, chief of police of Vancouver, has been a resident of the 
city since 1886. He arrived here just after the great fire which destroyed 
the town, finding but a small village surrounded by a dense forest. To-day 
there is a population of three hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, to 
whom Samuel North in his official capacity affords police protection, using 
every effort in his power to maintain law and order and rendering to the

city service that has made his name a synonym for safety to the law-abiding 
citizens and a source of terror to those who do not hold themselves amenable 
to the rules which govern the individual in his relation to the rules of life, 
privilege and property. 

Mr. North is a native of Waltenham, Norfolk county, Ontario, born on 
the 24th of December, 1861, and is of Irish lineage, although his more re- 
mote ancestors were natives of England. At an early day they removed 
from the " Merrie Isle " to the green isle of Erin. 

John North, father of Samuel North, was born in the city of Cork, Ire- 
land, and prior to his marriage emigrated to Canada, where he formed the 
acquaintance of Miss Elizabeth Hutchison, a native of Canada. Her father 
was born in Ireland and the line of descent is traced back to Scotch ancestry. 
On the maternal side he was descended from the Aliens of Scotland. The 
acquaintance of John North and Elizabeth Hutchison developed into friend- 
ship and later into love that was consummated in marriage. In order to 
provide for his family Mr. North worked in the lumber woods of Lake county, 
Michigan, where he was killed by the falling of a tree, his death occurring 
when he was comparatively a young man. His remains were then sent back 
to Canada for interment. His wife survives him and is now in the sixtieth 
year of her age. They were the parents of three daughters and two sons, 
only two of whom are in Vancouver, Jane, now the wife of J. W. Little, and 
Samuel North of this review. 

When a young lad Samuel North lost his father and he went tO' live 
with an uncle, John Hutchison, by whom he was reared. He acquired his 
education in the public schools and in his extreme youth began earning his 
own livelihood, facing the varied and difficult problems which confront each 
individual as he starts out to cope with the world and wrest fortune from 
the bands of fate. In 1877, when but sixteen years of age, he went to the 
lumber district in Bay -City, Michigan, where he worked for three years. He 
was afterwards employed in farming in Manitoba and also in the Northwest 
Territory, where he spent eight years, during a part of which time he was in 
the transport service during the Northwest rebellion. 

In the fall of 1886 he arrived in Granville, British Columbia, now the 
city of Vancouver. The building of the town was then proceeding with 
great rapidity, and there was a constant demand for laborers of all kinds. 
Mr. North secured work as a day laborer and was thus continued until 1890, 
when he accepted the position of patrolman on the police force of Vancouver. 
He afterward served for two years as a jailer and in 1897 was promoted to 
sergeant, while on the 15th of July, 1901, he was appointed chief of the 



388 BRITISH COLUMBIA, 

police department, which position he has since followed with due regard to 
the obligations and duties that devolve upon him. During the past four years 
he has been intimately and continuously connected with the duties of the 
police department of Vancouver, and his long continuance, combined with 
his natural keen perception, quickness of action and firmness of disposition, 
tempered with a kindly, charitable spirit and marked executive ability, have 
combined to make him one of the most capable officials that Vancouver has 
known. His public service receives hearty endorsement from the large ma- 
jority of Vancouver citizens, and has gained him high encomiums. He has 
made a study of the needs of the department and during his service as chief 
Vancouver's model police station has been built, largely according to the 
plans instituted by Mr. North. It is a brick structure, three stories and 
basement, and is located at No. 236 Cordover avenue. The building and 
equipment cost about forty thousand dollars, and the ground is now valued 
at about forty thousand dollars. There are now about twenty-seven steel 
cells, twelve cells for intoxicated people, one of them padded for the insane 
temporarily confined here. There is one dock cell for those brought to the 
jail on the charge of misbehavior, and there is a female department and 
yard entirely separated from the main section of the prison. There is also a 
nice police courtroom and all the offices and conveniences of every descrip- 
tion, and the building is a credit to the city of Vancouver. The department 
is now manned with seventy-nine men, including the chief, two sergeants, 
four detectives, three desk clerks, one police court clerk, three jailers and 
seventeen patrolmen, and the entire force is under Chief North and is thor- 
oughly modern and efficient, and law and order are very severely maintained 
in the city; in fact, the criminal classes here have little opportunity and the 
property and lives of the citizens are very thoroughly protected, the behavior 
of Vancouver police department being highly commended. 

In 1894 Mr. North was married to Miss Joanna* Stewart, a native of 
Canada and of Scotch lineage. Their home has been blessed with six chil- 
dren, all born in Vancouver, namely : John Wilson, Samuel Stewart, Caro- 
line Margaret, Ann Elizabeth, Aleck Neil and William Roy. Mr. North 
and his family are Presbyterians in religious faith. They have a nice home 
in Vancouver and many warm friends here. Mr. North is a valued member 
of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, but his time is completely en- 
grossed with the duties of his office, and therefore he has given little time 
to social matters. He yet has the esteem and friendship of a large majority 
of Vancouver's citizens.

FRANK BERNARD LEWIS. 

Frank Bernard Lewis has been closely identified with the business 
and civic affairs of Revelstoke and vicinity for several years, and is a man 
of recognized business ability and integrity, and has been found a willing 
and efficient coadjutor in all enterprises looking to the welfare and growth 
of Revelstoke. 

Mr. Lewis is a native of Oswestry, Shropshire, England, where he was 
born October 5, 1876, and his parents, Thomas and Mary (Davis) Lewis, 
are both living in Revelstoke. After receiving his education he entered 
commercial pursuits, and has been connected with affairs of a commercial 
nature for many years. The family home was established in Revelstoke 
in 1890, and up to 1900 he was in the general merchandise business. In 
the latter year he entered insurance, real estate and mining business as 
agent and broker, and is at the present writing also largely interested in 
mining on his own account. His business connections place him among 
the leading men of affairs in the city, and he is a stockholder in many of 
the business enterprises of the city and district. He is one of the youngest 
men actively engaged in private business affairs in Revelstoke, and the 
executive ability and capacity for large responsibilities already displayed are 
an earnest of a broad and eminently useful career in the world of business 
and public affairs. He is a member of the Revelstoke board of trade, and 
is a city alderman, being a member of the fire, water and light committee 
of the city council. In politics he is a Liberal, actively interested in that 
victorious and progressive party, and is secretary of the local Liberal As- 
sociation. 

In 1900 Mr. Lewis was married to Miss Bertha Powell, a daughter of 
Frederick Powell, of Liverpool, England. Their two children are Francis 
Ernest and George Winyard. The family are Church of England people. 

CLARENCE BURPEE HUME. 

Clarence Burpee Humie is a man of progress, of great energy and enter- 
prise, and, although young in years, has accomplished much during his brief 
career. He is recognized as one of the foremost business men of Revel- 
stoke, where he has been prosperously engaged in merchandising during almost 
the entire history of the town and where he is now at the head of one of 
the most complete ^and up-to-date mercantile establishments to be found in 
interior British Columbia. 

Mr. Hume was born in Florenceville, New Brunswick, October 18, 



390 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

1867. His father, R. W. Hume, for many years a merchant, is still living 
in Florenceville. The son spent most of his youth in St. John, New Bruns- 
wick, where he attended first the public schools and then a business college, 
after which he entered the employ of W. H. Thorne &amp; Company, hardware 
merchants of St. John, with whom he remained three years. He then came 
to British Columbia to work for his cousin, J. Fred Hume, in Revelstoke, 
and continued as an employe three years more. He was then ready to 
enter business on his own account, and in 1892, with C. F. Lindmark as 
partner, he established the general merchandise business which has since 
been so steadily successful. The concern grew rapidly, and in 1902 a new 
store building was erected and a joint stock company organized. The build- 
ing, all of which is devoted to the business, is a two-story brick, fifty by one 
hundred feet, and was constructed at a cost of twenty-five thousand dollars. 
As has been stated, this is one of the finest and most modem mercantile 
houses in the province, and would be a credit to any city. Mr. Hume is 
secretary of the Revelstoke Lumber Company, president of the Lawrence 
Hardware Company, Revelstoke, has large mining interests, has stock in 
the McCullough Creek Mining Company, and is a generally prosperous and 
influential business man. Mr. Hume is a Conservative in politics, and his 
religious faith is that of the Methodist church. 

FRANCIS BEDDORS WELLS. 

Mr. Wells is a native of London, England, and in 1883 he came out 
to Winnipeg and began work in the construction of the Canadian Pacific 
Railway at Swift Currents and at Calgary. Following that he took up 
government land in the Northwest Territory, and in 1886 came to Revel- 
stoke. since which date his interests have chiefly centered at this place. For 
a short time he did work for the Canadian Pacific, but then went into the 
mercantile business by purchasing the general merchandise establishment of ' 
T. A. W. Gordon. James A. Gilker, now of Nelson, British Columbia, 
was his partner for a time, but later sold out to Mr. Wells, and the latter . 
has since conducted this well known enterprise alone and with a high and ; 
worthily gained success. He is manager of Trout Lake City townsite, and 1 
is president of the Keystone Mines, Limited, and of the Camp Creek Hy- j 
draulic Company. 

GEORGE W. URQUHART. 

George W. Urquhart, who for ten years has been a r.esident of Rossland 
and since 1886 has made his home in British Columbia, arrived in the prov-« 
ince when a young man of twenty-one years. He has therefore throughout the; 




^i 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 391 

entire period of his manhood Hved in this portion of the country and his 
advancement has here been won through capabiHty, close appHcation and 
honorable effort. He was born in Indian Land, Ontario, in January, 1865, 
his parents being Alexander and Catherine (McNaughton) Urquhart. His 
father is deceased, while his mother still makes her home in Ontario. 

George W. Urquhart was a public-school student in Athol, Ontario, 
and entered business life as a salesman in a general mercantile store at 
Dun vegan, where he remained for fifteen months. In 1886 he came to 
Vancouver, having but recently attained his majority. Thinking that the 
west afforded a more advantageous field of labor for a young business man 
he came to the coast country and worked in a meat market in connection 
with Patrick Gannon in Vancouver. He was afterward with the firm of 
Hayes &amp; Mackintosh, being thus connected for six and a half years. Later 
he was engaged in the express business in Vancouver for a short time and 
subsequently he renewed his efforts as a dealer in meats. In the fall of 
1895 he came to Rossland, where he prospected for two years, and he then 
entered the employ of P. Burns &amp; Company as assistant bookkeeper. His 
capability won him recognition there in a desirable promotion and in 1901 
he was made manager of the business, in which capacity he has since served, 
capably and successfully controlling its affairs. 

Mr. Urquhart belongs to Pacific lodge. No. 26, I. O. O. F., of Van- 
couver. He is a Liberal in his political views and is a member of the 
Presbyterian church. During his residence in Rossland he has gained many 
friends who esteem him highly for his many excellent traits of character 
and he is popular in the city. 

ROBERT J. SKINNER. 

On the roster of officials in Vancouver whose capable service have won 
them high encomiums is found the name of Robert J. Skinner, provincial 
timber inspector and mining recorder for the province of British Columbia. 
He is one of the honored pioneers of the province, having made his home in 
this part of the country since the i6th of January, 1853. He was born in 
Essex, England, on the 24th of March, 1844, and comes of English and 
more remotely of Dutch ancestry. His father, Thomas James Skinner, was 
born in England and the record of the family in that country can be traced 
hack for more than four hundred years, but prior to that time the ancestors 
ived in Holland. Thomas James Skinner married Miss Mary Lowdham 
Goodell, a native of Buckinghamshire, England, and they secured passage on 
the vessel, Norman Morrison, which weighed anchor at an English port on 



392 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the 15th of August, 1852, and sailed around Cape Horn, reaching what is 
now Victoria upon the i6th of January, 1853. Mr. Skinner was for five 
years in the employ of the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, after which 
he settled upon a farm on Vancouver island and improved his land, spending 
his remaining days upon that place. He took a very active part in the early 
affairs of the county, aiding in molding its public policy and shaping its| 
destiny. He served as a member of the colonial legislature and also held a 
magistrate's commission. A man of strong mentality and public-spirited | 
interest, he was well fitted for leadership in thought and action, and his efforts^ 
proved of marked value in the line of material, political, intellectual am 
moral development. Both he and his wife were members of the Church oi 
England. The former lived to the advanced age of eighty years and his 
wife was also about the same age at the time of her demise. They enjoyed 
the respect of all who knew them and had the warm friendship of many of | 
the pioneer residents of this province. They brought with them from Eng- 
land five children, and three were born to them after their arrival in British 
Columbia. With the exception of the. oldest son, all are now living, these 
being Ernest M., who resides on the old homestead in the Cowichan district;- 
Annie L., who is now the wife of John Bremner, who occupies a position 
in the navy and is in New England ; Mary, who' resides at the old home with 
her brother; Constance, the widow of Hon. A. B. E. Davis, who was attorney 
general and premier of the province; Ada, the wife of John Stevenson, sheriff 
of Cariboo county; and Emily, at home. 

Robert J. Skinner was educated in the Hudson Bay school in Victoria, 
being a youth of about eight years when he accompanied his parents on their 
emigration to the new world. He also received private instruction and at 
fourteen years of age entered upon his business career, becoming a general 
utility boy in a wholesale commission store in Victoria. His adaptability, 
energy and faithfulness were demonstrated in the fact that he continued with 
that company for nine years. He then joined the Hudson's Bay Company 
and went into the interior, visiting the Kamloop, Kootenay and Cariboo dis- 
tricts, buying furs and selling goods for that company for twenty years, dur- 
ing which time he had charge of. several of the trading posts. He con- 
ducted an extensive and profitable business for the company, and while visit- 
ing these places in the interests of the business he became widely known, 
winning the respect and confidence of all with whom he was associated. This 
led to his election to the legislature as a member of the last house of the 
assembly in the colony, and while serving in that capacity he voted for con- 
federation.- He continued with the Hudson's Bay Company until given his 



. L 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 393 

present office on the 15th of April, 1888, since which time he has served as 
provincial timber inspector and mining recorder for the province of British 
Columbia. Upon receiving the appointment he took up his residence in the 
new city of Vancouver, and he is now serving in his sixteenth year in that 
capacity. He is very thoroughly acquainted with nearly every portion of 
the province, and it is safe to say that there is no pioneer of the county more 
widely or favorably known than he. 

On the I St of February, 1877, Robert J. Skinner was united in marriage 
to Miss Annie Lindsay, a native of Scotland, and they now have one daughter. 
Miss Constance Lindsay Skinner, who was born in Cariboo. She has been 
provided with excellent educational privileges, and is now engaged in news- 
paper and literary work. The family home is a delightful residence and the 
members of the household belong to the Church of England. Mr. Skinner 
has advanced in business and political circles by reason of his inherent force 
of character, his marked fidelity and capability, and is known as an honored 
man in all life's relations. 

P. I. PALMER. 

P. I. Palmer, manager of the Vancouver Sash &amp; Door Company, lim- 
ited, and thus closely identified with one of the leading productive indus- 
tries of Vancouver, has gradually advanced from compairatively humble 
financial surroundings to his present responsible position in connection with 
trade circles of British Columbia. He was born in Buckingham, Quebec, 
on the 2d of August, 1876. His father, Mathew H. Palmer, was a native 
of England, and in his boyhood emigrated to Canada, where he was mar- 
ried to Miss Rosina Cosgrove. For some years he was engaged in lum- 
bering and subsequently turned his attention to the harness and saddlery 
business. He filled the office of secretary and treasurer of Buckingham, 
Province of Quebec, and remained an active and valued representative of 
business inetrests in that place through a long period. He died in the 
seventy-third year of his age and his wife, still surviving him, is now in 
her sixty-second year. 

P. I. Palmer was educated in Ottawa, Ontario, and entered upon his 
business career in the lumber woods, but in iSg6, attracted by the business 
opportunities, which according to re,port were offered on the Pacific coast, 
he came to Vancouver when in his twentieth year. His brother, A. E. 
Palmer, had an interest in the Vancouver Sash &amp; Door factory, limited, 
and it was through his influence that P. I. Palmer was induced to make 
this city his home and the field of his business operations. He was first 



394 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

employed by the company as an accountant and in 1901 was promoted to 
his present position, having for the past three years conducted the business 
with satisfactory success as manager of the Vancouver Sash &amp; Door fac- 
tory. The property was purchased by the present company in 1892. This 
is a private stock company, the officers being J. B. MacLaren, president; 
J. T. De Pencier, secretary and treasurer; and P. I. Palmer, manager. The 
company manufactures sash, doors, moldings, trimmings and all kinds of 
house furnishing materials and has a thoroughly equipped factory supplied 
with the latest improved machinery. There is a large demand for the 
manufactured product all over the northwest in addition to a profitable city 
trade, and the annual business amounts to one hundred and twenty thousand 
dollars, while employment is furnished to from fifty to sixty-five men. The 
business methods of the company are liberal and honorable and its success 
has long been assured, while under the capable direction of Mr. Palmer of 
this review the enterprise is being profitably conducted and has become 
one of the leading productive industries of Vancouver. 

Mr. Palmer was married in 1901 to Miss Lilian E. Morency, a native 
of Canada, and they have two children : Bemice Evelyn Rose and Albert 
Edward, both born in Vancouver, where they have a pleasant residence. 
They are faithful adherents of the Roman Catholic church. Mr. Palmer 
has never had occasion to regret his determination to ally his interests with 
those of the far west in early manhood, for in its business conditions he 
has found opportunity for his expanding powers and has made for himself 
an honorable name in commercial circles. 

THE ALBION IRON WORKS COMPANY, LIMITED. 

The Albion Iron Works Company, limited, of Vancouver, is one of 
the large manufacturing enterprises of British Columbia, the company being 
engaged in the manufacture of marine engines and boilers, logging engines, 
logging machinery, sawmill machinery and, in fact, everything which usu- 
ally constitutes the output of large iron works. In 1902 the property was 
purchased by The Albion Iron Works Company, Limited, of Victoria, the 
president being Mr. John Bryden. 

W. H. R. Collister, who- is the manager of this large manufacturing 
enterprise in Vancouver, has throughout his business career been a practical 
mechanical engineer, with constantly developing ability and powers. He 
is a native of Liverpool, England, and a son of R. Collister, who came to 
British Columbia in 1875. He has been a prominent shipbuilder, is now 
Dominion government inspector of hulls and also surveyor for Lloyds. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 395 

W. H. R. Collister learned the shipbuilding trade with his father 
and with other prominent shipbuilders. He was educated in Liverpool and 
came to British Columbia with his family in 1875, settling in Victoria. 
He engaged in ship-building there and was for several years connected with 
the Albion Iron Works Company, Limited, of Victoria and Vancouver, re- 
signing that position in order to take charge of the plant of the Albion Iron 
Works Company, Limited, in Vancouver. His intimate and thorough knowl- 
edge of the business has made him particularly well qualified for the con- 
trol of this extensive industry and he has the full confidence of the business 
community as well as of the company which he represents. 

Mr. Collister was married in 1887 to Miss E. C. Lewis, a daughter 
of ex-Mayor Lewis, of Victoria. Their union has been blessed with a 
son and daughter, William K. and Ethel A. They have a nice residence 
in Victoria and have the high esteem of a wide circle of friends. Mr. 
Collister devotes his undivided attention to the management of the manu- 
facturing plant and yet is deeply interested in public afifairs concerning 
the welfare and progress of his adopted city. 

JAMES PATERSON. 

James Paterson, managing director of the Paterson Shoe Company, 
Limited, at Victoria, is a well known business man in this city, and as a 
principal member of one of the largest shoe firms of the northwest he has 
made his influence widely felt in commercial circles. He is progressive, 
capable and public-spirited, a comparatively young man hardly past forty- 
five, and his energy and enterprise are valuable factors in the general wel- 
fare of Victoria. The Paterson Shoe Company, Limited, are wholesale 
and retail dealers, and conduct five stores in this province, three at Victoria, 
one in Vancouver and one in Nanaimo. Mr. Paterson founded this shoe 
business in Victoria in 1888, and ten years later the business was incor- 
porated under the present name. The company are also special agents of 
the Granby Rubber Company. They have a large warehouse on Langley 
street, Victotia, and their extensive trade extends throughout this province. 

Mr. Paterson was born in the city of Toronto, Canada, June 19, 1858, 
l3eing of Scotch ancestry. His father, John Paterson, was a shoe manu- 
facturer in Toronto, but is now retired from active affairs and residing in 
Alberta, being seventy years old. His wife and the mother of Mr. James 
Paterson was Miss Elizabeth Walker. They are Presbyterians, and highly 
respected people. 

Mr. Paterson's early education was received in Aberdeen, Scotland, 



396 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and he learned the shoe business with his father. He was in the employ 
of the Hudson's Bay Company at Winnipeg for a time, and in 1887 came 
to Victoria and in the following year established his present business, which 
has l&gt;een developed under his firm control and executive management into 
the foremost shoe business of Victoria, 

In 1886 Mr. Paterson was married to Miss Jennie Mclntyre, of Strath- 
roy, Ontario. Their only child, Gilzean, was born in Victoria. Mr. and Mrs. 
Paterson are valued mem.bers of St. Andrew's Presbyterian church, in which 
he is one of the managing board. He is also a member of the board of 
trade of the city, and during the period of his residence here he has never 
lacked the civic spirit which means so much for the progress of a city. 

ADOLPHUS WILLIAMS. 

Adolphus Williams, a lawyer of Vancouver, ex-member of the provincial 
parliament and now police magistrate of his city, was born in Aylmer, On- 
tario. His father. Dr. Adolphus Williams, was a native of London, Eng- 
land, whence he crossed the Atlantic to Canada. He married Miss Jane 
Burdick, a daughter of C. Burdick, a New England loyalist, who at the time 
of the American Revolution never swerved in his allegiance to the king, and 
because of his fidelity he received property in New Brunswick. Dr. Williams 
practiced his profession in Aylmer during his remaining days and was a 
helpful citizen in matters of public progress and improvement, taking an 
active interest in all that pertained to the general good. He belonged to the 
Church of England and was a man of the highest respectability, enjoying in 
unusual degree -the friendship and confidence of those with whom he was 
associated. Unto him and his wife were born six children, five of whom are 
living. 

Adolphus Williams, the only representative of the family in British 
Columbia, was educated in St. Thomas, Canada, and in the University of 
Toronto. Determining to devote his attention to the practice of law, he 
studied in the latter institution and afterward practiced in Toronto until 
1889, when he came to Vancouver. He was alone there for -a year, after 
which he entered into his present partnership as a member of the firm of 
McRiillips &amp; Williams. This relation has since been maintained and the 
firm has a large law practice of an important character, being connected with 
much of the leading litigation here in the courts of this locality. 

Mr. Williams in politics has always been a Conservative, and as such 
was elected to the provincial parliament, becoming a member of the first 
session that held its meeting in the new parliament building. He was a 




.^^yty^^^e^c 



i 



BRITISH COLUMBIA ' 397 

member for five years, was active in connection with constructive legislation 
and did all in his power to advance the welfare of the people through the 
enactment of wise and beneficial laws. After his retirement from parliament 
he re-entered upon the practice of law, and in December, 1903, he was ap- 
pointed police magistrate, which position he has since filled. 

In 1890 Mr. Williams was married to Miss Katherine Wylie Raeburn, 
a native of Edinburgh, Scotland. They are members of the Episcopal church, 
in which he has filled the offices, acting as church warden for a number of 
years. They are deeply interested in the various church activities and Mr. 
Williams has been prominent not only in professional circles, but also in 
promoting the intellectual, moral and political advancement of his adopted city. 

JOHN J. SEHL. 

John J. Sehl is one of Victoria's prominent business men and a native 
son of the city, having been born on March 15, 1864, when this flourishing 
city was little more than a village. He is now actively associated with the 
mangement of the extensive business which was built u,p by his father's 
energies and broad capacity for mercantile affairs. His father, recently 
deceased, during a career extending from the pioneer history of Victoria, 
made his name a synonym for success, integrity and conscientious devotion 
to every undertaking, and his life has much of inspiration and permanent 
impress for good to the succeeding generations of Victoria's citizenship. 

Born in Germany in 1832 and emigrating from the fatherland to New 
York when twelve years of age, Mr. Jacob Sehl, the father, finished his 
education and learned thoroughly the cabinet-maker's trade in the latter city, 
but being full of enterprise and the spirit of adventure, he joined the hosts 
of forty-niners and took passage by way of the Panama route for the golden 
west. Arrived in San Francisco, he went directly to the gold diggings and 
tried for success in this exciting and strenuous occupation, but working in 
the water gave him rheumatism, and he then abandoned gold prospecting 
and mining and returned to San Francisco to take up his trade. A few 
years later the discoveries on Eraser river in British Columbia again allured 
him to the attractions of placer mining, and in pursuit of this second golden 
phantom it chanced that he made his arrival in Victoria in the year 1859, 
when almost primeval conditions were on every hand. From Victoria he 
went to Sooke, but again he was not long in concluding that gold mining 
was not his forte, and he then turned his attention to the manufacture of 
shingles at Sooke. He also did carpenter work. He had the honor of 
erecting the first house in Victoria to be covered with weather-boarding, 



898 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

all previous houses having been of logs. Somewhat later Mr, Sehl entered 
into a partnership by w^hich a furniture business was to be instituted in 
Victoria, but the partner, l&gt;eing intrusted with the joint money for the 
purpose of laying in stock at San Francisco, went off and was never again 
heard of. This left Mr. Sehl in straits for a time, but his known honesty 
and integrity proved to be capital for all the backing he needed. He went 
to San Francisco and secured a stock of goods on time from a dealer who 
had entire faith in liim and who told him he might have all the goods he 
wanted. The furniture business, once established in Victoria, met with 
well deserved success from the start, and the industry and honorable meth- 
ods of its proprietor soon gave the enterprise an impetus toward becoming 
one of the foremost mercantile firms of the city. In time he acquired prop- 
erty on Government street on which he eercted a large brick block forty- 
eight by one hundred and thirty-three feet, with three stories and a base- 
ment, this structure being used to accommodate his retail trade, and he 
also put up a three-story brick furniture factory. The entire business block 
is filled throughout with stocks of furniture, crockery, glassware and house- 
furnishing goods, and is the best known emporium of the kind in Victoria, 
if not in the entire province. He devoted all his energies to this enter- 
prise, and private business and the welfare of the city were the principal 
objects of his attention until his death. He organized the Sehl Hastie Furni- 
ture Company, but later became sole proprietor of the business. 

The death of this pioneer and representative business man of Victoria 
occurred on June i8, 1904. He was a member of the Odd Fellows and 
also of the city volunteer fire department. His wife was Elizabeth (Van 
Allman) Sehl, a native of Iowa, and four of their nine children are still 
living, as follows: Elizabeth Sherwood, a resident of New York city; 
Dorothy Louisa, the wife of Julius Elizalda; and John J. and William, the 
two brothers being only about a year apart in age. Both brothers are actively 
engaged in the business founded by their father, they having been educated 
in this city and brought up in the furniture establishment and honorably 
and successfully filling the place left vacant by their father. Mr. John L. 
Sehl is now manager for the other heirs. He was married in 1892 to 
Miss Celia Tiber, a native of North Dakota. He is affiliated with the 
Knights of the Maccabees and the Order of Pendox, being a trustee in 
the latter.

RICHARD MAYNARD. 

Richard Maynard is one of the foremost of Victoria pioneer citizens, 
widely known for his connection with business interests, for his prominent 
identification with the pnbhc welfare and municipal progress and for his 
large-hearted and public-spirited citizenship. He came to Victoria forty- 
five years ago. and has ever since been active in his own department of 
work an.d a representative of the best interests of business and society. 

Mr. Maynard was born in Stratton, Cornwall, England, February 22, 
1832. He belongs to good old English stock, and his parents were Thomas 
and Mary (Squires) Maynard, both natives of England. Both parents were 
active workers in the Church of England, and his father for many years 
was a member of the church choir. 

When Mr. Maynard was two years old the family moved from Strat- 
ton to Bude, and in that place he was reared and received his early educa- 
tion. For his serious business in life he was apprenticed to learn the shoe- 
maker's trade and the leather business in general. But his strongest inclina- 
tion when a lx)y was for the life of a seaman, and "he consequently went to 
sea in the ship Stickly, under Captain Greenway, and for a year was en- 
gaged principally in the coasting trade between England and Wales. He 
then returned to Bude, and for some years following he worked at his 
trade during the winter and followed the sea in the summer. 

In 1852, when in his twentieth year, he was happily married to Miss 
Hannah Hatherly, who was born in England. Soon after their marriage 
they came out to Canada, and settled at Bowmanville, Ontario, where he 
engaged in work at his trade. The year 1859 was the date of his coming 
to Victoria, being attracted thither by the gold excitement, and he did some 
mining on the Eraser river. He also spent a year of prospecting and min- 
ing with moderate success at Stickeen, after which he decided upon returning 
to Victoria and establishing himself in his regular business. In pursuance 
of this plan he returned to Bowmanville for his wife, and they came out 
to Victoria together. Mrs. Maynard had during the interim learned the 
photographer's art, and when they located in Victoria she engaged in that 
occupation while he started in a small way a shoemaking business, and 
success came to both enterprises. Mr. Maynard also learned photography, 
and the two, husband and wife, have been in that business in Victoria 
longer than any other firm. They have also bought and sold all kinds of 
photographic materials. Later Mr. Maynard retired from the shoe business. 
One of his sons now conducts a first-class store in Victoria, and another son 



400 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

gives his active attention to the photographic supphes store. As a business 
man Mr. Maynard has enjoyed a reputation for integrity and genial treat- 
ment of all his associates of which he may well be proud. It is a pleasure 
for him to recall the fact that he was able to retain one employe in his shoe 
business as long as he remained in that trade, and he and his wife have 
a man with them in the art gallery Avho has been continuously in their 
employ for twenty-eight years. 

Mr. Maynard's photographic work has been of the highest order of 
excellence, and all the photography bearing the Maynard imprint represents 
the best in that art. He has done a great deal of work along this line for 
the government. He was in the Behring sea and took the photographs of 
the seals which were sent to Paris to be used for evidence in the famous 
arbitration case concerning the seal fisheries. He has also taken a number 
of pictures of Indian villages. On one occasion while photographing in 
an Indian village, a native inhabitant, frenzied by fire-water, knocked him 
down with a club, broke his camera, and would undoubtedly have killed 
him on the spot had not a constable opportunely reached him and effected 
his rescue. During his long career Mr. Maynard has passed through many 
experiences of a dangerous and trying nature, and his life story is far re- 
moved from monotony and routine chronology. When on his first voyage 
to Victoria, on June 20, 1859, when the ship Forward was nearing her 
landing her magazine blew up and discharged through the skylight half the 
kitchen furniture and dishes high into the air. The third ofKcer of the ship 
was killed by the explosion, and the captain's sons and the captain's servant 
also lost their lives. At the time Mr. Maynard was standing by a table in 
a room adjoining the place where the cataclysm occurred, and the door 
was blown from its hinges and precipitated with great force against the 
table, and had Mr. Maynard been standing on the other side of the table 
he would undoubtedly have been cut in two, but as it was he escaped with 
only a few scratches., 

The following children have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Maynard : 
George H. is one of the sons engaged in the shoe business in Victoria; Zela 
is the wife of W. H. Smith; Albert H. manages the photographic supply 
store which was founded by his father; Emma, the deceased wife of J. F. 
McDonald, left a small family of children ; Lillie is also deceased ; Albert 
H. married Miss Adelaide Graham, the daughter of James Graham, and 
they have a son and two daug'hters, who are nearly through with their 
educations. 

Fraternally Mr. Albert H. Maynard is a member of the Foresters and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 401 

the Woodmen, and served as banker in the latter order for a number of 
years. He is also a member of the Natural History Society, and has always 
given a more than passing interest to the study of the wonders and beauties 
of the nature around him. For eighteen years he was treasurer of the 
Vancouver Building Society. When the Victoria free museum was founded 
he was the curator's helper and hunted with him in order to obtain speci- 
mens of animals, and in order to be of greater service in this work he 
learned the art of taxidermy. Mr. Richard Maynard and his wife erected 
a good brick building in which are located their photographic stock and 
their art gallery, and they also own several residences in the city. This 
venerable pioneer couple have wrought well in their life work, and they 
have much ground for satisfaction wijth their past efforts and are free to 
spend the declining years of their life as they choose, whether in quiet 
pleasure or in continued usefulness to themselves and the world. 

WILLIAM MACRAE LAWRENCE. 

William Macrae Lawrence, managing director of the Lawrence Hard- 
ware Company, Limited, of Revelstoke, has been a resident of this thriving 
little city of interior British Columbia since 1897, and has brought to his 
private affairs and the community life such a degree of energy and execu- 
tive ability combined with high public spirit that he has been a most effective 
factor in promoting the varied departments of activity of this community 
and has become recognized as one of the most valuable assets in the citizen- 
ship of Revelstoke. 

Mr. Lawrence has had a varied career and diversified experiences dur- 
ing his lifetime. He was born in Cape Town, South Africa, August 22, 
1861. His father, Rev. James Lawrence, did all the photographic work for 
the Livingstone expedition on its return from the famous explorations in 
the heart of Africa. The mother is Margaret (Lyle) Lawrence, and both 
parents are now living in Winnipeg, Canada. 

The first five years of Mr. Lawrence's life were spent in Cape Town, 
and he was then taken to Edinburgh, Scotland, where he attended the 
Newington school, and at Glasgow was a pupil in the old normal school. 
After spending a few years in travel he located in Winnipeg, Canada, where 
he established a hardware business and conducted it successfully for several 
years. In 1897 he came to Revelstoke, and has since been closely identified 
with the business affairs and general progress of this place. In 1904 he 
organized the Lawrence Hardware Company, Limited, and has since been 
its managing director. For the business of this flourishing firm a new brick 



402 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

building has been erected, fifty by one hundred feet, two stories high, and 
at a cost of twenty-two thousand dollars, a structure which in itself is 
a credit to the town and its owners, and the business carried on beneath 
its roof is in the first line of importance in this part of the province. 

Mr. Lawrence was married in 1889 to Miss Carrie Grant, a daughter 
of William Grant, of Emerson, Manitoba. Three children have blessed 
their home, named Robert Grant, James Lyle and Eileen. Mr. Lawrence 
is a member of Kootenay Lodge No. 15, A. F. &amp; A. M., and in religion is 
a Presbyterian. 

WILLIAM D. BRYDONE JACK, M. D. 

Dr. William D. Brydone Jack, a. successful representative of the medical 
profession in Vancouver and a member of the board of aldermen, has been 
a resident of this city since 1890. Born in Fredericktown, New Brunswick, 
on the 13th of June, i860, he is of Scotch ancestry, his father, William 
Brydone Jack, having b€en a native of St. Andrews, Scotland, where he was 
reared and educated. Emigrating to New Brunswick, he was there identi- 
fied with the educational development of the province for many years, becom- 
ing professor of mathematics and afterward president in the University of 
New Brunswick. He married Miss Caroline Disbrow, whose ancestors were 
among the United Empire Loyalists of English lineage, who, leaving the 
United States at the time of the American Revolution because of their loyalty 
to the king, removed to New Brunswick. Professor Brydone Jack died in 
the sixty-fifth year of his age, but his widow still survives and occupies the 
old home at Fredericktown, New Brunswick, in her seventy-fifth year. They 
were adherents of the Presbyterian church and of the Church of England, 
respectively. 

Dr. Brydone Jack, supplementing his early education by collegiate train- 
ing, won the Bachelor of Arts degree in the University of New Brunswick, 
■and prepared for the practice of medicine in the Gill Medical College, Edin- 
burgh, Scotland, where he won the Doctor of Medicine degree. He then 
located for practice in Staffordshire, Cheshire, England, and while there 
learned of British Columbia and the possibilities for future greatness for the 
young city of Vancouver. His brother, A. C. Brydone Jack, had already 
come to the province, and gave glowing accounts of the prospects for the 
city and its rapid and substantial development. Dr. Brydone Jack therefore 
accordingly decided to make Vancouver his permanent home and the field of 
his professional labor, and, opening an office here in 1890, he has since given 
undivided attention to his practice, which he carries on along general lines,

but also makes a specialty of obstetrics and the diseases of children. His 
practice grew so rapidly that he found it necessary to secure the aid of an 
assistant, and in 1901 he admitted Dr. Monro to a partnership. They have 
spacious offices in the McKinnon block at the corner of Hastings and Grand- 
ville avenue, in the very center of the business district of Vancouver. 

As soon as Dr. Brydone Jack was settled in his adopted city and had 
entered upon his practice he became deeply interested in public affairs and 
has been the champion of many progressive measures, whose beneficial 
influences are now widely felt. He has done everything in his power to pro- 
mote the city's growth along substantial lines and in January, 1904, he 
was elected alderman. He was instrumental in securing the appointment 
of Dr. Underbill as health officer of the city. That gentleman is an eminent 
physician whose entire time is devoted to looking after sanitary conditions 
and the health interests of Vancouver, thus preventing the spread of dis- 
ease. Dr. Brydone Jack is a Liberal in politics and was chosen by his party 
as the candidate for the provincial parliaments, but was defeated at the 
election. 

In 1893 Dr. Brydone Jack was married to Miss Alice Hicklin, a native 
of Staffordshire, England, and they have four children, the three eldest 
born in England and the other in Vancouver. Frederick William. is now a 
student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada ; Cyril Herbert and Gladys 
are at home. The family are Episcopalians in religious faith. Their home 
is at the corner of Landow and Westmin3ter avenue and is one of the fine 
residences of the city. Dr. Brydone Jack belongs to the Masonic fraternity, 
is a past master of Acacia Lodge No. 22, A. F. &amp; A. M., likewise belongs 
to the Royal Arch Chapter and has taken the Scottish Rite degrees. He 
is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of 
Pythias and the Independent Order of Foresters. He was president of Van- 
couver Medical Association, 1903-6, also president of British Columbia Med- 
ical Association, 1905, and is prominent both professionally and socially, 
having the strong intellectual force and devotion to his profession which 
have made him one of the leading representatives of the medical fraternity 
in Vancouver. 

WILLIAM SULLEY. 

William Sulley is connected with an industry which has contributed 
largely to the wealth and prosperity of Vancouver. The early founders of 
the city are the promoters of its commercial and industrial enterprises and 
in this respect William Sulley has contributed in large and valuable measure 



4U4 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

to the substantial upbuilding of Vancouver. He is connected with the 
lumber trade and in his business he displays untiring energy, quick percep- 
tion and a mental celerity that enables him to form his plans readily and 
execute them with dispatch. It has been his close application to business 
and his excellent management which have brought to him the high degree 
of success that is today his. 

Mr. Sulley, who was born in Nottingham, England, on the i6th of 
May, 1841, is descended from worthy English ancestors. His parents were 
Edward and Charlotte (Pennstone) Sulley, both of whom were natives of 
England. The father was a merchant and became the resident member 
in England of a large New York mercantile firm, conducting an extensive 
business there. He attained the venerable age, of eighty-eight years, while 
his wife passed away in her seventy-third year. They were Baptists in re- 
ligious faith and Mr. Sulley was very active in church work, devoting almost 
his entire attention to his business life and church duties. His was an 
honorable manhood, characterized .by activity and crowned with successful 
result. Unto him and his wnfe were born seven children, of whom six 
are yet living. 

William Sulley acquired his education in the schools of Nottingham, 
England, and in Germany, and in early life become connected with clerical 
duties and commercial business. He was engaged in the manufacture of 
lace in Nottingham from 1866 until 1890, when selling out he made arrange- 
ments to establish his home in the new world and in 1891 arrived in Brit- 
ish Columbia. His early identification with its business interests was as the 
representative of a London financial institution engaged in investing in 
real estate and loaning money. He continued as the manager of the busi- 
ness until 1896, in which year he entered into partnership with E. H. Heaps. 
They had at first a small shingle mill, which has grown to be one of the 
largest manufactories of the kind on the Pacific coast. The plant at Van- 
couver covers twenty-one acres of ground. The business is carried on 
under the firm style of E. H. Heaps &amp; Company, manufacturers of lumber 
and shingles. Their large mills at Vancouver are situated at Cedar Cove 
on Powell street and they also have mills at Ruskin on the Eraser river. 
The specialties of their output are A.A.i, high grade shingles, flooring, 
ceiling, siding, drop and two cheek siding, cedar bevel siding, sash and 
doers, casing, base, moldings, turnings, etc. The main office of the com- 
pany is at the corner of Powell street and Victoria drive. The growth of 
Vancouver has been phenomenal, but not more so than the development of 
the Heaps Lumber Company, which now ships its manufactured product to 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 405 

Ontario and many points in the northwest, enjoying a very large and suc- 
cessful business. Mr. Sulley was married in 1868 in England to Miss 
Helen Place, a native of Nottingham, England. They have three children. 
The eldest, William, is now in charge of the machinery in the mills, having 
had special training as a machinist. Harry is connected with the firm of 
I. &amp; R. Morley on Wood street, London, England, one of the largest, oldest 
and best known mercantile houses of that city. Helen Kathleen is now the 
wife of E. C. Taylor, of Vancouver, manager of the Empress Manufactur- 
ing Company. The home of Mr. and Mrs. Sulley is a beautiful residence 
in the west end of the city and they are prominent in social circles here. In 
fact, few men are more widely or favorably known in the enterprising city 
of Vancouver than Mr. Sulley. He has been an important factor in busi- 
ness circles and his popularity is well deserved as in him are embraced the 
characteristics of an unbending integrity, unabating energy and industry 
that never flags. 

M. J. BARR. 

M. J. Barr, a well known business man of Vancouver, was born in Mon- 
mothshire, Wales, on the 25th of November, 1875, ^"^^ i^ ^^ Scotch ancestry. 
His father, Mathew Barr, was a native of Paisley, Scotland, while his mother, 
who bore the maiden name of Hannah Chancey, was born in India. Both of 
her parents were killed in the memorable Indian mutiny. Mathew Barr was 
a sergeant major of the First Foot Tenth Regiment, and served in the Crimean 
and Indian wars, receiving in recognition of his military service four medals 
and three clasps in addition to the pension which was granted him. He died 
in the year 1889 and is still survived by his widow, who now resides with 
her son, M. J. Barr, in Vancouver. Another son, James Barr, is engaged in 
the transfer business in Vancouver. 

The family came to Vancouver in 1891, M. J. Barr being then in his 
sixteenth year. He completed his education in the schools of this city and 
afterward learned the plumber's trade with W. G. Warren. In 1896 he 
formed a partnership in the plumbing business with Mr. Anderson, the present 
firm of Barr &amp; Anderson being thus formed. They have worked harmoni- 
ously together in the development of a business which has now become ex- 
tensive. Their work has ever given the utmost satisfaction to those by whom 
they have been employed and they have been awarded the contracts for the 
plumbing in several of the city school buildings and many other prominent 
structures. They have also put in furnaces and installed high grade heating 
plants in many good buildings of Vancouver. They are now doing work 



400 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of this class in the large Vancouver General Hospital and today their con- 
tracts amount to eighty thousand dollars. They have erected a two story 
brick shop at No. 114 Hastings street and are the leading plumbers of the 
city, a position which they have gained through their capability, earnest de- 
sire to please their patrons and conscientiousness in all business relations. 

Mr. Barr was married in 1901 to Miss Ella Dillabaugh, a native of 
Carlton, Ontario, and daughter of M. S. Dillabaugh, of that place. This 
union has been blessed with a son, whom they have named Mathew Lislie. 
They have a nice home of their own in Vancouver and are members of the 
Presbyterian church. Mr. Barr is an active member of Mount Herman 
lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., and also belongs to Vancouver chapter, R. A. M. He 
has always taken an active part in athletics, and played with the Vancouver 
Lacrosse Club for eight years. A young man, he has attained an enviable 
position in business circles and his qualifications and ambition argue well for 
still greater success in the future. 

JOHN GUY BARBER. 

John Guy Barber has the honor of having been the first jeweler in Revel- 
stoke, and for the past fifteen years he has made that little city the center of 
his prosperous and constantly expanding trade in this line. He also has other 
interests in the vicinity, and is one of the best known and most highly esteemed 
citizens. He is a man of great personal popularity, has made a reputation for 
ability and high integrity in his business relations, and in many ways is to be 
accounted one of the mainstays of Revelstoke's commercial and civic pros- 
perity and substantiality. 

Mr. Barl^er is a native of the United States, having been born in New 
Haven, Connecticut, November 25, 1866. His parents, E. L. and Barbara 
(Logan) Barber, are still living and are residents of Winnipeg. The public 
schools of Winnipeg and St. John's College furnished Mr. Barber his literary |i 
training, and after school days were over he learned the watch-making trade j 
at Diamond Hall, in Winnipeg. After a brief period of employment by 
Walter Harris he started in business for himself at Winnipeg, but continued 
it for only one year, when he sold out and in 1887 located at Kamloops, Brit- 
ish Columbia, where he was in the employ of J. E. Saucier for a time. In 
1890 he came to Revelstoke and started a jewelry establishment, being, as 
stated, the first one to embark in that line in Revelstoke, which was itself at 
that time a new town, about five years old. Since then his business has ex- 
panded rapidly, and he now conducts both a wholesale and retail trade, being 
the acknowledged leader in this line in this part of the province. He has 




"^f-^tJitLCL/yvx. (7W. V^ AlpJ^iAJj^ 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 407 

also acquired large mining and real estate interests, and is a successful and 
enterprising man in all departments of his activity. 

Mr. Barber affiliates with Kootenay lodge. No. 15, A. F. &amp; A. M., and 
with Gold Range lodge. No. 26, Knights of Pythias. He is a Conservative 
in politics, and a member of the English church. 

WILLIAM H. P. CLUBB. 

William H. P. Clubb, enterprising and energetic, is a member of the 
firm of Clubb ik Stewart, proprietors of the largest clothing and men's fur- 
nishing gQods establishment in the province of British Columbia. In view- 
ing the mass of mankind in the varied occupations of life, the concluSiion 
is forced upon the observer that in the vast majority of cases mien have 
sought employment not in the line of their peculiar fitness but in those fields 
where caprice or circumstances have placed them, thus explaining the reason 
of the failure of ninety-five per cent of those who enter commercial and pro- 
fessional circles. In a few cases it seems that men with a peculiar fitness for 
a certain line have taken it up, and marked success has followed. Such is 
the fact in the case of the subject of this biography. 

Mr. Clubb was born in Peterhead, Scotland, on the 24th of April, 1862, 
and belongs to an old family long resident of Aberdeenshire, Scotland. His 
father, James Clubb, was born there in 1841 and died in 1904 at the age 
of sixty-seven years. His mother, who bore the maiden name of Isabella 
Watson, was also a native of Aberdeenshire. William H. P. Clubb is in- 
debted to the public school system of Ontario for the educational privileges 
he enjoyed and when he had put aside his text books he began learning his 
business with his father, remaining in Ontario until he came to Vancouver. 
In that country he was a friend of Mr. Stewart, his present partner, and they 
decided to come together to this city and establish a business in the young but 
growing metropolis. Accordingly they inade their way to the Pacific coast 
and established their present store with a small capital and a limited stock of 
goods, but as the city developed with remarkable rapidity their patronage 
also grew until they now carry the largest stock and have the most extensive 
clothing and men's furnishing goods establishment in the province. It is 
located at No. 315 Hastings street in the center of the business district of 
Vancouver. It was established in April, 1890, and has since been success- 
fully conducted by the original proprietors. The store is fifty by one hun- 
dred and twenty feet, filled with all of the goods in their line most carefully 
selected. Both have been connected with the clothing business since boyhood, 
entering no other business field, and their equipment for the conduct of the 



408 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

store in Vancouver was therefore naturally good, their success being based 
upon broad experience as well as marked enterprise and industry. They 
have a tailoring, business in the iDasement and in this department cater to 
the very best trade. Both the partners are industrious, energetic men of 
laudable ambition and determined purpose, devoted to the business and fol- 
lowing the most progressive and honorable methods in the conduct of their 
enterprise. 

In 1893 Mr. Clubb was married to Miss Elizabeth Houston, of Glas- 
gow, Scotland, daughter of the late Andrew Houston. They have a daugh- 
ter, Jessie, born in Vancouver. Both are members of the Wesley Methodist 
church and take an active and interested part in its work, Mr. Clubb serving 
as a member of its board of trustees and also as treasurer. He is also a 
meml&gt;er of the school board of the city. They have a nice residence on 
Nicola street and its attractive hospitality is enjoyed by many friends. 

A. M. STEWART. 

A. M. Stewart, junior member of the firm of Clubb &amp; Stewart, whose 
activity in the field of commercial enterprise in Vancouver, dating from 
April, 1890, has been a factor in promoting the general business prosperity 
of the city, was born in Em.bro, Ontario, on the loth of March, 1864. His 
father, William Stewart, was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, while the mother, 
who bore the maiden name of Isabella Clark, was born in Petty Inverness- 
shire, Scotland. They emigrated to Canada in 1836. 

A. M. Stewart was educated in Embro, Ontario, as a public school stu- 
dent and entered upon his business career in the capacity of a salesman for a 
dealer in men's furnishing goods. He has continued in this line of mercan- 
tile enterprise and coming to Vancouver with Mr. Clubb, they formed their 
present partnership and have since conducted a business which has constantly 
grown in volume and importance until it now returns a very gratifying an- 
nual income. Mr. Stewart was married in 1894 to Miss Agnes Brown, a 
native of Ontario and a daughter of the late J. T. Brown, who for eight years 
was license inspector in this city. They have two children : Charles and 
John, both born in Vancouver. They are members of St. John's Presby- 
terian church, of which Mr. Stewart is one of the managers. Theirs is a 
nice residence on Denman street. Both Mr. Clubb and Mr. Stewart are mem- 
bers of the board of trade, the former belonging to the civic committee, and 
both take a deep interest in promoting the substantial progress and welfare 
of Vancouver.

ROBERT E. LEMON. 



Robert E. Lemon has been closely identified with the substantial im- 
provement and development of the northwest, and his efforts have been of 
material benefit in promoting the progress and substantial growth of the 
section of the country in which he makes his home. He is now filling the 
position of warden of the prison at Nelson and throughout the community 
in which he resides he is held in high esteem as a worthy pioneer citizen. 

Mr. Lemon, a native of Paris, Kentucky, was born April 24, 1855, and 
is a son of Samuel and Ann (Haslet) Lemon, both of whom are deceased. 
When he was but a boy his parents removed to Plattsville, Wisconsin, settling 
upon a farm, where their son Robert was reared. He attended the public 
schools in the winter months to some extent and in the summer seasons 
assisted in the work of the home farm. The greater part of his education, 
however, was acquired under the direction and through the instruction of 
his mother, a most highly educated and cultured lady, while from his father 
he received practical training in the work of the fields. When eighteen 
years of age he held a second grade certificate and for six years he engaged 
in teaching in Colorado and Wisconsin. On leaving the latter state he went 
to Alabama, where he spent two years in a general mercantile store and there 
he also learned the drug business, making a specialty of that branch of trade. 
He went to Alabama in 1875 and continued in the south until March, 1877, 
when he removed to Colorado and engaged in teaching school in and near 
Pueblo until August 12, 1880, with the exception of one summer. At the 
date mentioned he went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he occupied a 
clerical position in an eating house in Coolidge, then called Bacon Springs. 
For a year he acted in that capacity and then took charge of the eating house 
at Williams, Arizona, which he conducted for a year. He afterward became 
manager of all the eating houses on the line in the territory, but while he 
met with fair success there he felt that he would have still better business 
opportunities in the northwest, and on the ist of July, 1884, he left Arizona 
for Puget Sound. Having spent a short time in Seattle and in Tacoma, Wash- 
ington, he made his way to Van Horn, British Columbia. His first position 
in the northwest was that of purser on the steamer L^dy Dufferin, in which 
capacity he served for two months. On the ist of November he took a posi- 
tion in a general store, where he worked until the ist of May, when he em- 
barked in general merchandising at Eagle Pass, conducting his store there 
from May, 1885, until 1886. It was a prosperous period in his career and 
gave him opportunity for still larger business interests. He removed from 



410 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Eagle Pass to Revelstoke and afterward to Nelson in 1888. In 1901 he 
was appointed w-arden of the prison at Nelson, which position he still holds. 
A detailed account of the history of Mr. Lemon would be to present a clear 
picture of business development in the northwest, for he came to this section 
of the country as a pioneer and has been closely associated with the work of 
progress and upbuilding through the intervening years. He ran the first flat 
boat down the Columbia river on the 14th of May, 1888, making his way to 
Sproat's Landing. He erected the first building on the Columbia river in that 
part of the country. Of the ten men who made the trip on that ferry boat 
but four are living in this locality. Mr. Lemon reached Nelson by building 
a trail from the Hall mine to the Poorman trail, a mile and a half, and took 
his own supplies in September, opening his store here in 1888. He con- 
ducted the store through the winter and sold out there the following sum- 
mer. He then went to New Westminster and contracted on the Westmin- 
ster &amp; Southern road, doing all of the crib work on the river. He then re- 
turned to Nelson, where he has since remained, and he is today one of the 
valued citizens of the place, a typical pioneer resident, entirely free from 
ostentation or display, but with strong purpose, marked individuality and 
unflagging energy, qualities which have enabled him to contribute much to 
the pioneer development and later progress of the northwest. 

CHARLES MORGAN KINGSTON, M. D. 

Dr. Charles Morgan Kingston, whose thorough preparation and resource- 
ful effort in the practice of medicine have gained him prominence as one of 
the representatives of the profession in Grand Forks, was born in West Hunt- 
ingdon, Hastings county, Ontario, December 27, 1867, his parents being 
Charles Kingston and Mary (Fletcher) Kingston. The father is a retired 
farmer now living in Sterling, Ontario, but he has been called upon to mourn 
the loss of his wife, who passed away in 1871. 

Charles Morgan Kingston at the usual age became a student in the public 
schools and advanced through the successive grades of primary and grammar 
school work until he had entered the high school at Sterling. His literary 
course completed he began preparation for the practice of medicine as a stu- 
dent in Trinity Medical College in Toronto, and there he was graduated with 
the class of 1894. He took the post-graduate work in the summer of that year 
in the Post-graduate College of New York and thus by thorough and careful 
preparation was well qualified for the responsible duties of the profession. 
He entered upon practice in Everett, Ontario, spending four years there, and 
on the expiration of that period he came to British Columbia. Having prac- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA _ 411 

ticed for one year in Shoal Bay he came to Grand Forks in 1899 and has since 
been a representative of the medical fraternity in this place. He is also 
medical health officer and city physician. In this field of labor where promo- 
tion depends entirely upon individual merit he has steadily worked his way 
'upward and with a full realization of the responsibility that devolves upon the 
medical practitioner he has put forth his best efforts to alleviate human suf- 
fering, his work being prompted not only by the laudable desire for financial 
gain but also by a love of scientific research and humanitarian principles. He 
is surgeon for the Granby Smelter Company, provincial health officer for the 
district and belongs to the Canadian Medical Association. Fraternally Dr. 
Kingston is connected with the Masonic lodge, the Knights of Pythias and the 
Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and he has the warm esteem of his 
brethren of these organizations. 

GEORGE SMITH McCARTER. 

George Smith McCarter, lawyer and .prominent man of affairs at Revel- 
stoke, has not only acquired a fine reputation and practice as a lawyer since 
locating in this little city some seven or eight years ago, but has also become 
closely identified with the public life and direction of the affairs of his munici- 
pality, and has extensive business and real estate interests in the district. 

Mr. McCarter was born in Haldimand county, Ontario, March 4, 1867, 
a son of George and Sarah (Sherwood) McCarter, the former of whom is 
living in St. Thomas. Ontario, and the latter is dead. The common and high 
schools and the collegiate institute of St. Thomas furnished him his early 
literary education, after which he applied himself to preparation for the legal 
profession. In St. Thomas he was first a student with Coyne and Mann and 
then with D. J. Donohue. and later was in the offices of Kerr. McDonald; 
Davidson and Paterson at Toronto. Being admitted to the bar in 1891. he 
commenced practice at St. Thomas in partnership with T. W. Crothers. In 
1892 he established himself at Calgary, where for five years he was a partner 
of Senator Lougheed. and since 1897 he has been located at Revelstoke, where 
in the meantime he has built up a good practice and enjoys a front rank among 
the legal fraternity of this part of the country. 

For one year Mr. McCarter served as alderman of Revelstoke. was city 
solicitor for five years, and at the present writing is official administrator 
for the district. He has numerous business interests in this vicinity, in min-

Howard Douglas, of Calgary. They have three children, Douglas, Arnold 
and Doris. 

GEORGE KENNEDY— THE KENNEDY BROTHERS. 

George Kennedy, present postmaster of New Westminster, is the second 
son of the late James Kennedy, and was born in New Westminster, August 
II, 1859. Educated under the tuition of his father and in the excellent 
schools of the " Royal City," he graduated thence, in his sixteenth year, 
into that university of varied experience, observation, and practical educa- 
tion — a newspaper office, and followed this vocation in various capacities, 
on the Pacific coast, for upwards of ten years. Two brothers, James M. 
and Robert Kennedy, who had had a similar training, also learned the print- 
ing business about the same time, and in the spring of 1888 these three 
formed the afterwards well known publishing and printing firm of Kennedy 
Brothers, which acquired the daily and weekly Columbian from a company 
of which the late Hon. John Robson, premier of British Columbia, was 
founder and a leading member. 

For twelve strenuous years thereafter, during a stirring period of great 
political upheaval and development in the province, which the Cobimbian 
under their management was largely instrumental in promoting and direct- 
ing, the Kennedy Brothers continued to publish this influential organ of 
public opinion, throwing themselves into the fight for fair representation of 
every portion of the province in the provincial legislature, hitherto denried by 
the powerful sectionalistic clique at the island capital which had dominated 
the government. Inseparably bound up with this fundamental question of 
fair representation was the question of a just distribution of the revenue, 
sectionally speaking, which had also been denied by means of the unfair 
system of representation maintained. Other issues raised and vigorously 
advocated and advanced by the Columbian under the control of the Kennedy 
Brothers and by the political party evolved as a result of this agitation, were 
land and railway policies devised with a view to conserving what was left 
of the public domain and generally safeguarding the public interests as 
opposed to the reckless policy of give-away and monopoly-fostering that had 
hitherto obtained. 

Through three provincial general elections, starting with a small reform 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 413 

party in the elections of 1890, the light along these lines, under the banner 
of Fair Representation, was ceaselessly waged, the Columbian, which had 
been foremost in throwing down the gage, being throughout in the forefront 
of the battle, and the publishers, Kennedy Brothers, had the satisfaction of 
seeing the cause steadily gaining both in the country and in the legislature. 
Each succeeding general election found a larger and stronger reform party 
in the legislature, which wrested, piecemeal, some measure of reform in the 
representation and along the other lines indicated, from the reluctant party 
in power, until that party was completely and finally overthrown in the gen- 
eral election of 1898. The victorious party of reform in the legislature un- 
fortunately developed internal discords and weaknesses which robbed it of 
the fruits of its victory, and a crisis was precipitated, resulting in another 
general election in 1900, from which was evolved a new reform party, under 
the leadership of the famous Joseph Martin, which effectually held the bal- 
ance of power between several contending factions until a thoroughly fair 
measure of representation was brought forth from the rather peculiar situa- 
tion, and a most important measure of long delayed and hitherto denied 
justice to New Westminster city and district was also secured at the same 
time by this same vigorous and consummate reform faction — namely, the 
construction of the great railway and trafiPic bridge across the Eraser river 
at New Westminster city, at a cost of over a million dollars. Having 
wrested these boons from the weak transition government of the day, the 
reform faction, holding the balance of power, precipitated another general 
election, which was held on altogether new lines of cleavage in the province 
— and the old order of things political, with the old sectional and clique 
abuses, against which the Kennedy Brothers, through their paper, had waged 
unremitting and strenuous warfare for more than a decade, was ended, the 
chief things for which they had contended having also been secured. 

The Kennedy Brothers also took a leading part, with their paper, in 
the Dominion general election of 1896, in winning the New Westminster 
Dominion electoral district and the province generally from a former almost 
unbroken Conservative allegiance to the support of the new Liberal admin- 
istration of Wilfred (now Sir Wilfred) Laurier, which was returned to 
power, for the first time, in the elections of that year. 

The Columbian, under the ownership and control of Kennedy Brothers, 
also took a prominent part in promoting and inaugurating, in 1889, the an- 
nual Provincial Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition at New Westminster, 
for which the Royal City has since been famous. The establishment of 
the highly successful City Market and the inauguration of the electric light 



414 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

system and water works as civic enterprises were also strongly advocated and 
vigorously fought for by the Columbian in their initiatory stages, although 
determinedly opposed by conflicting private and corporate interests. 

The history of the Columbian under the Kennedy Brothers is, in fact, 
the history of a most stirring, eventful, overturning as well as reconstructive 
and significant epoch in the annals of the province and of their native city. 
Costly and important libel suits they had to defend more than once, and on 
one memorable and historic occasion, during the session of 1891-92, they 
were summoned before the bar of the provincial legislature by the incensed 
government because of some unusually vigorous criticism of its acts. Defy- 
ing the summons, the arm of the law was invoked, and sheriffs and deputies, 
sergeants-at-arms and provincial police, with the chief at their head, were 
pressed into service to bring the political offenders into the toils. The much 
wanted publishers had to take refuge south of the international boundary 
for two weeks, until an absent judge of the supreme court returned to New 
Westminster, before whom habeas corpus proceedings could be taken im- 
mediately on their arrest. They returned voluntarily as soon as they learned 
the judge was in the city, and were at once placed under arrest, and their 
application for a writ of habeas corpus being denied, they were lodged in 
the New Westminster jail over night, on the next day taken to Victoria in 
custody of the chief of provincial police and the sergeant-at-arms, and 
brought before the bar of the house, where, refusing to apologize, but main- 
taining the justice of their criticisms, they were thrust into the jail at Vic- 
toria. The most eminent legal talent of the province was retained in their 
behalf, and application for a writ of habeas corpus was made before another 
supreme court judge, but before he could render his decision the astute at- 
torney-general, foreseeing defeat, had the legislature prorogued, thus auto- 
matically releasing the incarcerated newspaper men, and the judge then de- 
clined to give a decision since it could have no effect. The attorney-general 
afterwards promised to have a test case submitted, but failed to do so. All 
these proceedings consumed nearly a month, during which the legislature 
was kept in session, although when the episode began, its work was prac- 
tically ended for that session. After the summons had been issued and de- 
fied, the government also introduced and put through a special act of the 
legislature, endeavoring to fortify themselves with the power which they 
feared they did not possess when they found their authority defied. But 
even with this special act, as has been seen, they did not abide the issue. 

In the spring of 1900, after twelve years of such strenuous and costly 
newspaper and political work, which has been only barely sketched in the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 415 

foregoing pages, having been twice in that time completely burned out — 
once in 1889, and again, with the almost total destruction of the city, in 
the fall of 1898 — and having, as they considered, accomplished their work 
for the time being, and feeling that they needed a period of recuperation, the 
Kennedy Brothers sold their newspaper and printing business to the present 
proprietors, the Columbian Company, Limited. The then incumbent of the 
postofifice. Mr. J. C. Brown, resigning his office about the same time, the posi- 
tion was offered by the federal government at Ottawa to Mr. George Ken- 
nedy, and accepted by him. James M. and Robert Kennedy, retiring from 
the publishing business at the same time, turned their attention to the exten- 
sive agricultural and real estate interests of the family. 

The Kennedy family, father and sons, have therefore been prominent 
factors for over forty-five years in affairs that nearly concern the city of New 
Westminster and the province of British Columbia, their work has been 
largely public-spirited and given to the causes which were dear to them, 
without such adequate compensation as would have been gained from like de- 
votion to pure business, and for this reason the careers of the father, now 
deceased, and of the sons, so potential in the business and public affairs to 
which they severally directed their attention, have a more than ordinary in- 
terest to the readers of the annals of British Columbia. 

JOHN MANNING SCOTT. 

John Manning Scott is a representative member of the British Columbia 
bar, carrying on a regular and profitable practice in Revelstoke, is active in 
public and political affairs, and a man of high standing socially and profes- 
sionally in this part of the province. He is one of the best equipped lawyers 
in British Columbia, being a graduate of one of the most famous law schools 
of America, and his subsequent experience in active practice has brought him 
into contact with all departments of his profession. He wields a wide per- 
sonal influence in interior British Columbia, and his legal business is con- 
stantly increasing. 

Mr. Scott was born in Brampton, Ontario, November 23, 1870. His 
father, now deceased, was A. F. Scott, who had a long and honorable career 
of twenty-seven years as county judge, and was a man of much prominence 
in his community. His mother, Annie Sophia (Furby) Scott, is now living 
in Winnipeg. Mr. Scott is a nephew of Hon. D. L. Scott, supreme justice of 
Edmonton. 

After passing through the common and high schools at Brampton Mr. 
Scott took up the study of law in the law department of Toronto University, 



416 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

from which he was graduated in the class of 1891 with the degrees of B. A. 
and LL. B. Osgood Hall at Toronto is the best known law school in Canada 
and has probably turned out more eminent lawyers than any other school in 
the Dominion. It was in this institution where Mr. Scott, after leaving 
Ontario University, continued his legal preparation for three years, and in 
1894 he was admitted to the bar. His first practice was at Brampton and 
then at Owen Sound, and he has been established at Revelstoke since 1898, 
having in the meantime gained a large and profitable share of the legal busi- 
ness of this part of, the province. He is a member of the British Columbia 
Law Association. He is a Conservative in politics, was president of the Con- 
servative Association one year, and is crown prosecutor for this district. He 
also has business interests, and is secretary of the Prince Mining and De- 
velopment Company. 

In February, 1900, Mr. Scott married Miss Marguerite Estelle Brown, 
step-daughter of H. A. Brown, a well known citizen and business man of 
Revelstoke, elsewhere represented in this work. Mr. and Mrs. Scott are mem- 
bers of the Church of England. 

ERNEST H. S. McLEAN, M. D. 

Ernest H. S. McLean, M. D., for a number of years recognized as the 
leading physician and surgeon of Revelstoke, has brought great ability and 
thorough preparation to the practice of the medical science, and his success 
is attested by his large and influential patronage and by his standing in the 
community where his professional career has been worked out. 

Born in Brockville, Ontario, May 18, 1871, a son of Henry and Harriet 
(Dulmage) McLean, his mother being deceased and his father a well known 
civil engineer and architect of Toronto, Dr. McLean had excellent youthful 
advantages, a good and inspiring home, and all influences and environments 
which tend to culture and strengthen character. Educated in the public 
schools of Brockville, then at the Collegiate Institute at Kingston, Ontario, in 
order to prepare himself for the medical career which was his ambition, he 
entered Queen's University at 'Kingston and was graduated with the class 
of 1 891. Having followed this up with a post-graduate course in the New 
York Polyclinic Institute, he then established himself in practice at Calgary, 
where he remained about a year, and for the following six months was assist- 
ant to Dr. Brett in the sanitarium at Barff. He has been located at Revel- 
stoke since 1892, and has enjoyed a large and profitable practice in the town 
and surrounding country. He is a progressive practitioner, keeping abreast 
of the strong current of medical progress by constant study, and he keeps 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 417 

in touch with the local fraternity by his membership and active participation 
in the Northwest Territories Medical Association and with the British Colum- 
bia Medical Association. He has been district provincial health officer 
throughout his residence in Revelstoke, and held the office of coroner for six 
years, from 1893 to 1899. Besides attending to his large professional busi- 
ness he has interests in the adjacent mining localities, and is broad-gauged and 
progressive in all his beliefs and activities. 

In 1894 he married Miss Maud Hamilton, whose father, W. L. Hamilton, 
is inspector of inland revenue at Belleville, Ontario. Mr. and Mrs. McLean 
have one child, Jean. The doctor is a member of Revelstoke lodge, No. 25, 
I. O. O. F., is a Conservative in politics, and he and his wife are members of 
the Church of England, and are esteemed members of society in their home 
town. 

JONATHAN MILLER. 

Jonathan Miller, who is filling the position of postmaster at Vancouver, 
is a pioneer of 1862 and his interest in the welfare and upbuilding of this por- 
tion of the country has been manifest in tangible efforts for the general prog- 
ress along many lines. He was born in Middlesex, Ontario, Canada, on the 
5th of September, 1834, and is of English and Scotch ancestry. His grand- 
father, Jonathan Miller, was of English descent, his ancestors having emi- 
grated to America at an earl)' period in the colonization of the new world, set- 
tling in Connecticut. He removed to Middlesex county, Ontario, and there 
received a grant of land in recognition of his loyalty to his king. His son, 
Jonathan Miller, father of our subject, was born in MioMIesex county, and 
after arriving at years of maturity he wedded Miss Martha Lockwood, whose 
birth occurred in the same county and who was a daughter of Henry Lock- 
wood, also a Loyalist who settled in Canada about the time of the Revolu- 
tionary war in the United States. The parents of our subject spent their 
entire lives in the county in which they were born. He was a farmer and also 
owned a store, and was known as one of the substantial and respected residents 
of his locahty. Both he and his wife were among the earliest advocates of 
the Alethodist religion in their community. He died in the sixty-fourth year 
of his age, while his wife, long surviving him, passed avv^ay at the advanced 
age of eighty-two years. The family numbered a son and three daughters. 

Jonathan Miller of this review, the only member of the family in British 
Columbia, was educated in Craddock Academy in his native county and after- 
ward engaged in merchandising there until the time of his removal to the 
west. Going to New York city, he took passage on the North Star steamer 
bound for the Isthmus of Panama and again embarking in the Pacific waters 



418 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

he arrived in San Francisco on the 28th of May, 1862. Soon afterward he 
again started on his way, arriving at Victoria on the 3rd of June. The fol- 
lowing day he went to Westminster and has continued to reside there ever 
since. For a short time he was engaged in teaming and later became general 
agent for the provisional government, in which position he continued until the 
1st of May, 1886, when he received the appointment of postmaster at Vancou- 
ver. That city had just received its name and the Canadian Pacific Railroad 
had just been completed to the town. Mr. Miller assisted in drawing up the 
charter for the town and he is now the only survivor of the board that executed 
that important document, and one of the very few surviving early settlers. 
When he entered upon the duties of postmaster eighteen years ago there were 
between eight hundred and a thousand inhabitants in the town and within 
this space of time it has reached a population of forty thousand. At first he 
had a boy as his assistant and now there is an assistant postmaster and thirty- 
four clerks. This is a distributing point for the mails for China, Japan and 
Australia, and is also the supply point for one hundred and twenty-five offices. 
On the 9th of February, 1856, Mr. Miller was married to Miss Margaret 
Springer, who was born in his native locality, a daughter of Benjamin Spring- 
er, who was likewise descended from Loyalist ancestry. They have had nine 
children, of whom seven are living, namely : Carrie, who is now the wife 
of T. D. Lees ; Alice, the widow of H. A. Berry, residing with her parents ; 
Gerta. the wife of A. C. Hitchfield, editor and publisher of the Atlin Clarion: 
Fred, at home ; Ernest, who is engaged in the practice of law at Grand Forks, 
British Columbia;. and Edwin and Walter, who were also residing at Grand 
Forks. The family are connected with the Church of England in their re- 
ligious faith and Mr. Miller is a member of the Ancient Order of United 
Workmen. He and his wife have a host of warm friends in the province, of 
which they are worthy pioneer settlers, and they now have a delightful home 
in Vancouver. His official service has ever been above reproach and no trust 
reposed in him has ever been betrayed in the slightest degree. 

WILLIAM L. FAGAN. 

William L. Fagan, provincial assessor and collector for the city and 
county of Vancouver, came to the province in 1886 and was the first agent of 
the Canadian Pacific Railroad Company at Moody and also at Westminster. 
A native of Ireland, he was born in the city of Dublin on the 22d of October, 
1843. His father, John Leonard Fagan, also a native of Dublin, was a 
solicitor there and in that city was married to Miss Ann Ambrosia Reed, a 
native of London, England. Mr, Fagan died at the age of forty years.

while his wife passed away at the age of thirty years. They w-ere the par- 
ents of four sons and three daughters, but WiUiam L. Fagan is now the only 
survivor of this family. His uncle, James Fagan, was a member of parlia- 
ment from the county of Wexford, was an extensive lumber merchant and 
one of the most prominent citizens of his locality. 

The preliminary educational advantages which William L. Fagan en- 
joyed ^\ere supplemented by a course of study in St. Patrick's College of 
Armagh, Ireland, from w'hich institution he was graduated with the class of 
1858. He afterward learned the hardware business and subsequently was 
connected with railroad service in the employ of the Great Western Railway 
Company in Ontario. Resigning that position he then entered the employ 
of the Canadian Pacific Railroad Company and after five years came to Van- 
couver to reside in 1888. Here he was called to public office and was at first 
assistant assessor and collector, while in 1889 he was promoted to his present 
position, giving the fullest satisfaction in the j&gt;erformance of his official 
duties. He is an honorable, reliable and capable government official, dis- 
charging his duties with the same fidelity which he would give to a private 
business transaction. He is deeply interested in his adopted city and its 
welfare, and his earnest support can always be counted upon to advance any 
movement calculated to prove of general good. 

Mr. Fagan w-as married in 1865 to Miss Ellen Thornton, a native of 
Dublin, and their union has been blessed with the following children : James 
E., head landing w-aiter in the Vancouver custom house; James S., who is 
assistant manager in the office of the Northwestern Telegraph Company; 
W. L., a newspaper reporter who did reportorial work in China and is now 
in Panama; May Alberta, the wife of James W. McGovern, immigration 
agent for the Dominion government at Port Arthur: Annie S., who was edu- 
cated in a Toronto College and is now at home with her parents, and all are 
members of the Roman Catholic church, thus adhering to the faith of their 
ancestors. Mr. Fagan belongs to the Ancient Order of United Workmen 
and has a wide and favorable acquaintance in Vancouver, where his capable 
official service has won him high respect. 

HENRY L. EDMONDS. 

Henry L. Edmonds, barrister and solicitor at New Westminster, is a 
prominent representative of the bar of the province, young, progressive, able 
and ambitious, and has already taken an honorable place among his fellow 
citizens and legal brethren. Fie is a native son of the city, born November 
2, 1870, was educated in the public schools and at Lome College, and received 



420 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

his law training under the late Chief Justice McColl and E. A. Jenns. On 
his admittance to the bar in 1894 he became a meml^er of the firm of Jenns and 
Edmonds, but retired from that firm in 1895 to join his brother, W. H. Ed- 
monds, in the firm of Edmonds &amp; Edmonds. This partnership continued until 
the fall of 1899. when W. H. Edmonds, received his present appointment as 
registrar of titles at Kamloops, British Columbia. Mr. Edmonds has trans- 
acted a large amount of the legal business of the district and enjoys a rep- 
resentative and increasing clientage. Mr. Edmonds has given his principal 
attention to commercial law. As a Conservative he has taken an active in- 
terest in politics, serving as secretary of the New Westminster campaign com- 
mittee in 1903, and as secretary of the New Westminster electoral district 
campaign committee in 1904. Fraternally he is consul commander of the 
local Woodmen of the World and a member of the Holy Trinity Episcopal 
church. 

The prestige of the Edmonds name has been so long established in this 
province, and especially in the city of New Westminster, that no introduction 
is necessary to recall one of the foremost personalities that shaped the early 
history and development of the institutions and industrial and business affairs 
of the city. The late Henry Valentine Edmonds, who was the father of the 
above mentioned barrister, and whose place and influence in the history of Brit- 
ish Columbia deserve especial prominence, was born in Dublin, Ireland, Febru- 
ary 14, 1837, and died in Vancouver, British Columbia, on the 14th of June, 
1897. He was the second son of William and Matilda E. (Humphries) 
Edmonds, both natives of Dublin. On the paternal side the descent is traced 
from an old English family that settled in Ireland during the early days, and 
on the maternal side the ancestry is French Huguenot, which escaped from 
France at the time of the St. Bartholomew massacre and the subsequent per- , 
secution of the Huguenots. 'fll 

Until his twelfth year the late Mr. Edmonds was educated in the schools 
of his native Dublin, and then the family moved to Liverpool, England, where 
he attended the high school Mechanics Institute. He later went abroad on the 
continent and was a student in the famous Moravian institute at Neuwied on 
the Rhine, finishing his education in Dresden, Saxony. His early business 
career was spent in Liverpool, and later in London. While in the latter city 
he joined the First Surry Volunteers, the first of the new corps established in 
that city. But upon the formation of the London Irish Volunteers he joined 
his national corps. Passing rapidly through the non-commissioned offices, 
he was selected by the Marquis of Donegal, the colonel commanding, as ensign 
of a new company especially formed for the marquis' son-in-law. Lord Ash- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 421 

ley. On receiving this appointment, July 5, i860, Mr. Edmonds was at- 
tached to the Third Battalion, Grenadier Guards, for drill instructions, and 
passed with a first class certificate of efficiency. April 13, 1861, he was pro- 
moted to a lieutenancy, and held this rank until he resigned in April, 1862, in 
order to come to British Columbia. At that time he stood second on the list 
for succession to the captaincy. Lieutenant Edmonds took part in the cele- 
brated reviews held, in i860, in High Park, in 1861, at Wimbleton, and in 
1862, at Brighton, under the late Lord Clyde. One day, after he had taken 
part in a parade, he was with part of his company when the London bridge 
fire occurred, and he and his men rendered material service in keeping the 
grounds clear so that the firemen could work freely. 

In May, 1862, Mr. Edmonds sailed from England, and on the following 
fourth of July arrived in San Francisco. He was there during the great re- 
joicing occasioned by the passage through congress of the Pacific Railway 
bill. In the same year he came on to Victoria and thence to New Westmin- 
ster, where his career of usefulness was henceforth to be so conspicuously 
wrought out. For twenty-five years he was one of the foremost real estate 
and insurance men of New Westminster, doing business with nearly all the 
property holders of the city. At the same time he gave his efforts gratuitously 
to the advancement of all the best interests of the city. He was active in 
the organization of the Royal Columbian Hospital and the Mechanics Insti- 
tute, and his services as secretary, treasurer or president were always, in de- 
mand. On the formation of the Board of Trade in New Westminster he 
served as its secretary for the first year, and had much to do with carrying out 
the details of the board's organization, later being its vice president and for 
many years continuing as a factor in its work. He gave freely of both means 
and time for the proper celebration of such annual events as the Queen's anni- 
versary, and also for the reception of distinguished visitors like the governor- 
general of Canada. He worked hard in committee and private to make these 
occasions a credit to his city^ He is honored as the originator of the May 
Day festival throughout the province, and its first celebration was held in 
his city. 

He helped to organize the Howe Sound Silver Mining Company and 
the Eraser River Beet Sugar Company. In 1873 he and other public-spirited 
citizens organized the Eraser Valley Railway Comnanv. of which he was made 
secretary. Later this became the New Westminster Southern Railway Com- 
pany, in which he continued his interests. In December, 1867, he was ap- 
pointed clerk of the municipal council, and during the seven years of his in- 
cumbency of this office all the city's business was performed without any legal 



422 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

costs to the municipality. He himself drew up all the by-laws and did all 
the work necessitated by the incorporation of the city. 

In December, 1872, Mr, Edmonds was selected as the agent of the gov- 
ernment under the Walkem government. In addition to the exactions of 
his private afitairs, he performed all the duties of this office for the district of 
New Westminster until January, 1876, when, on the advent into power of 
the Elhott ministry, it was decided to apportion the duties of agent to several 
officers, Mr, Edmonds thenceforth, until July, 1880, retained the office of 
sheriff, and gave a most creditable performance of its work. He enjoyed 
the confidence of the entire legal profession, and no suits were ever brought 
against him nor did he bring any except such as were entirely justified and 
eventuated in his favor. 

In 1870, on the organization of the New Westminster Rifle Volunteers 
under the late Captain Bushby, Mr. Edmonds was appointed lieutenant and 
adjutant, which position he held until 1874, when, on the formation of the 
No. I Rifle Company he was gazetted as captain, the following memo, being a 
part of the record : " Formerly lieutenant London Irish Volunteers, holding 
A- 1 class certificate for efficiency, and remained in command until May, 1875, 
when he retired, retaining rank of lieutenant." 

Mr. Edmonds served his city both in the council and as its honorable 
mayor, and also stood for the provincial legislature, as an independent can- 
didate,- but was defeated. In 1883 he received the appointment of justice of 
the peace for New Westminster city and district. Throughout his career here 
his confidence in the future and boundless resources and possibilities of New 
Westminster, city and district, and the entire Fraser river valley, was un- 
shaken, and he gave evidence of this confidence by his extensive investments 
in the city and district and especially at Port Moody and what has since de- 
veloped into the phenomenal city of Vancouver. He had large sawmill in- 
terests and timber tracts and mines in the province. He was a large share- 
holder in the New Westminster street railway, the Vancouver Electric Rail- 
way and Light Company. His benefactions were large, not only of individual 
effort as previously indicated, but of material value. He gave Vancouver 
the site for its most pleasantly situated public school, and the beautiful site for 
the Episcopal church and parsonage, and to New Westminster he donated 
a public school site. Flis activity and philanthropy were always manifest in 
the work of the Episcopal diocese of New Westminster, and the Churchman's 
Gazette records his repeated benevolences. 

In November, 1867, Mr. Edmonds was very happily married to Miss 
Jane Fortune Kemp. She was born in Cork, Ireland, eldest daughter of 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 423 

Thomas P. Kemp, of Cork. Six children blessed the home of Mr. and Mrs. 
Edmonds, all of them born in New Westminster, and five are living, namely : 
William Humphries, registrar of titles at Kamloops; Henry Lovekin. whose 
name begins this sketch; Beatrice Elvina, wife of W. A. Monro; Walter 
Freth, a tea and coffee merchant in Edmonton, Northwest Territory; and 
Mary Gifford, wife of C. M. Marpole, of Vancouver. 

ROBIE LEWIS REID. 

Robie Lewis Reid is one of the representative members of the bar of 
Xew Westminster, where he has taken a prominent part in legal and political 
affairs since taking up his residence some ten years ago. He is a capable and 
talented lawyer, of broad experience and learning, of known probity of char- 
acter and popularity among all classes, and he has been able to exert a wide 
influence wherever his career has placed him. 

Mr. Reid was born in Kentville, Nova Scotia, November 3, 1866. He 
is a member of a very old American family, various individuals of which 
have been men and women of .distinguished ability and with a sturdiness of 
character that has been one of the greatest inheritances handed down to their 
descendants. This branch of the Reids go back to an old New England 
Congregational family, and it is known that the earliest ancestor, Samuel 
Reid, landed on the shores of Massachusetts as long ago as 1660, he and his 
son, Samuel, Jr., settling at Holton. About 1760 the branch from which Mr. 
Reid is descended settled in Nova Scotia, where was bom Gideon Reid, the 
father of Robie Lewis Reid. Gideon married Ruth Ann Cogswell. 
She was a native of King's county. Nova Scotia, but her first American 
ancestor had settled in Massachusetts in 1649, from which colony his de- 
scendants came to Nova Scotia with the Pre-Loyalist immigration of 1760. 
On both sides of the house the male members were as a rule farmers. The 
parents, who are both still living, the father at the age of seventy-three and 
the mother sixty-eight, are Baptists in religious faith, and people of he highest 
worth and esteem among their fellowmen. There were five children in their 
family, but only two are living, Harry H. Reid, being a resident of Kent- 
ville, Nova Scotia. 

With his early education obtained in Picton Academy and at Dalhousie 
College, and his law studies being pursued at Dalhousie College and in Michi- 
gan State University at Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was graduated, Mr. 
Reid took up his active practice in Fairhaven, Washington, where he con- 
tinued for three years, and during that time he was admitted to practice in 
that state and in the United States district court. He first came to British 



424 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Columbia in 1885, and made permanent location in 1892, being admitted to 
the bar of the province in the following year. He has since practiced his 
chosen profession at New Westminster, and has a general law practice of 
profitable and broad extent. 

As a Conservative in politics Mr. Reid, in 1900, ran as the candidate of 
his party against Hon. John C. Brown for the local house, and was defeated 
by a majority of eighty-two votes in twelve hundred, his opponent being one 
of the most prominent citizens of the district. Mr. Reid is chairman of Mr. 
Taylor's committee, and on the stump has been able to do much effective work 
in behalf of his party. He has been a member of the debenture commission 
for the city of New Westminster since 1900. He is president of the Colum- 
bian Company, Limited, present proprietors and publishers of the well known 
daily and weekly Columbian, one of the most influential papers of the prov- 
ince. He also owns real estate interests in the city. 

October 17, 1894, Mr. Reid married Miss Lillie McKenzie, who was born 
in Kincardine, Ontario, a daughter of Duncan McKenzie. Mrs. Reid is an 
Episcopalian, and he attends that church with her. Mr. Reid served his city 
as alderman for two years,. 1899 ^""^^ 1900. 

FREDERICK ROBERTSON GLOVER. 

Frederick Robertson Glover, local manager of the Westminster branch 
of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, descended from a Cov- 
entry family prominently identified with the Reformation in England, for 
zeal in furthering w^hich two of its members suffered martyrdom, was bom 
in 1861 in Glasgow, Scotland, Mr. Glover is the oldest surviving son of 
the late William Glover, M. D., and Jessie (Wilson-McCallum), his wife, 
of Hemmingford, province of Quebec, where the family resided from 1867 
till 1894. 

Hemmingford was the scene of Mr. Glover's early boyhood and school 
days. From Montreal, where he spent several years in commercial life, in 
1881 he went to Winnipeg, and from there, in 1886, came to British Co- 
lumbia. Actively identified with the Dominion militia from a youth, dur- 
ing the Northwest Rebellion of 1885 he served as a lieutenant in the Winni- 
peg Battalion of Infantry, a special service corps afterwards known as the 
Ninety-fifth Battalion of Infantry. Coming to British Columbia he entered 
the journalistic field, first with the Vancouver Nezvs and later was city 
editor of the Nczvs- Advertiser for a time. In the fall of 1887 he took up 
his residence in New Westminster, and from then until the end of the year 
1895 '^v^s city editor of the Daily Columbian. In 1895 he was appointed to 





r^

the office of City Clerk, and filled that position for six years until the close 
of 1901. He then accepted the position of manager of the Westminster 
Branch of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, which office 
he still holds. 

As a member of the Board of Trade, and in many other ways, he has 
taken an active part in public affairs. He is still identified with the military, 
service, and at this writing holds the rank of lieutenant in the Corps of 
Guides. 

In 1889 Mr. Glover married Ada, third daughter of the late James 
Ellard, one of the pioneer and leading residents of New Westmnister. 

JOHN KIRKUP. 

John Kirkup, who has long been in the public service and has made an 
honorable record, his course reflecting credit upon those whom he has rep- 
resented, was born in Kemptville, Ontario, March 13, 185.5, his parents 
being James and Hannah (Taylor) Kirkup. His parents are now deceased. 
They were both natives of Northumberland county, England. 

In the grammar schools of his native city Mr. Kirkup pursued his edu- 
cation and afterward prepared for a business career by serving an apprentice- 
ship to the carriage-making trade. He afterward followed that business for 
a short period and later turned his attention to housebuilding. In 1876 he 
removed to Winnipeg, where he engaged in housebuilding and in 1877 he 
began operating a ferry on Red river. In the fall of the same year, how- 
ever, Mr. Kirkup came to British Columbia, settling at Victoria, where he 
engaged in carpentering and building and also in the manufacture of car- 
riages, following the dual pursuit until the fall of 1879. In that year he 
entered the public service as city policeman of Victoria, occupying that posi- 
tion until May, 1881, when he entered the service of the provincial govern- 
ment as constable and collector at Yale, making his home at that place until 
August, 1884, when he was assigned to duty in charge of police work on 
the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway at Savona. In May, 1885, 
he was transferred to Revelstoke, where he continued until 1890 and in the 
summer he had charge of the police work on the Columbia &amp; Kootenay Rail- 
road. Later he returned to Revelstoke, where he remained until May, 1894, 
when he took a trip to the east and upon his return he went to Duncan's 
or Vancouver Island, where four months were passed. He was sent to Ross- 
land in March. 1895, as constable and collector, and in 1898 he was made 
government agent and gold commissioner for the district, still acting in the 
dual capacity. In the varied official service which he has performed he has 



426 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

always been found faithful to duty, reliable and trustworthy, looking tO' the 
best interests of the general government and of the locality. 

On the ist of January, 1891, Mr. Kirkup was married to Miss Sue 
Kerr, a daughter of Robert Kerr, of Kemptville, and they have two children, 
Jack and Robert. The parents are communicants of the Church of England, 
and fraternally Mr. Kirkup is connected with Corinthian lodge, No. 27, A. 
F. &amp; A. M., having been treasurer thereof since its organization. He is 
esteemed for his many good qualities, for his reliability in office, his trust- 
worthiness in private life and well deserves mention among the leading citi- 
zens of Rossland. 

HON. RICHARD McBRIDE. 

Hon. Richard McBride, premier of British Columbia, comes of a well 
known family of the province, his father, Arthur H. McBride, having come 
from the north of Ireland to Canada in 1858, while his mother, Mary Darcy, 
was a native of Limerick county, Ireland. Premier McBride was born at 
New Westminster, December 15, 1870. Educated in the grammar and 
high school of New Westminster up to the age of sixteen, Mr. McBride 
then entered Dalhousie University at Halifax and graduated from that well 
known institution with the degree of LL. B. in 1890. Returning to this 
province he began his law reading with T. C. Atkinson, and his second 
preceptor was the Hon. Angus J. McColl, late chief justice of British Co- 
lumbia. Called to the bar in July, 1892, he at once began practice as a 
junior member of the firm of Corbould, McColl, Wilson and Campbell, at 
New Westminster. In 1893 he struck out for himself and practiced alone 
until 1895, when he took as an associate Mr. W. J. Whiteside, which part- 
nership being dissolved in the following year he formed a connection with 
H. F. Clinton, since deceased, which continued until the present firm of 
McBride and Kennedy was formed. 

Mr. McBride's entrance in the larger field of politics began in 1896, 
when he contested unsuccessfully the New Westminster riding with Mr. 
Aulay Morrison. In 1898, again in the field, he was elected a member for 
the Dewdney constituency as a supporter of the government of Hon. J. H. 
Turner over Charles H. Whitham, and later was returned from the same 
riding over the same opponent, by an increased majority. On June 21, 
1900, he was called to the executive department of the provincial gov- 
ernment and given the portfolio of minister of mines, and, going to the 
people for endorsement, was re-elected by acclamation. |fl 

When Premier Dunsmuir, on September 3, 1901, joined with the party 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 427 

of Hon. Joseph Martin, leader of the opposition, by inviting Mr. J. C. 
Brown to join the cabinet, Mr. McBride resigned to show his disapproval 
of the union. The result w^as that he was largely instrumental in Mr. 
Brown's defeat in the ensuing by-election. In September, 1901, Mr. McBride 
was elected president of the Liberal-Conservative Union of British Co- 
lumbia, and, being chosen leader of the opposition at the opening of the 
legislature in February, 1902, has remained the leader of his party ever 
since. On June i, 1903, Mr. McBride was called by the lieutenant governor 
to form a new cabinet, since which time he has been premier of the province. 
He also holds the portfolio of minister of mines. 

He was married in September, 1896, to Miss Margaret McGillvray, a 
native of Ontario and whose parents came from Inverness, Scotland. 

MARTIN BEATTIE. 

Martin Beattie, in the insurance, real estate and general brokerage 
business at Kamloops, prominent in business and public affairs of his dis- 
trict, has been closely identified with this section of British Columbia for the 
past twelve or thirteen years, having transferred a most successful business 
career, begun and for a long time carried on in his native Ireland, to this 
western country, where his ability in the conduct of large affairs has enabled 
him to take a like commanding place among his fellow citizens. 

Born in county Cavan, Ireland, in 1850, the son of a successful farmer, 
Martin Beattie and his wife Eliza (Beatty) Beattie, both of whom are now 
deceased, Mr. Beattie was reared on his fathers farm and received his edu- 
cation in the Royal School of Cavan. He early turned his attention to 
agricultural affairs, and at the age of nineteen held the important position 
of land steward for L. T. B. Saunderson, one of the large landed pro- 
prietors of Ireland. Two years later he began farming on his own account, 
and continued that pursuit very successfully until 1880, in which year the 
chronic land agitation broke out afresh and disturbed all agricultural condi- 
tions. In this controversy Mr. Beattie sided with the property owners, and 
his sympathies led him to take a prominent part in succeeding events, espe- 
cially as manager of the Property Defence Association of Dublin from 1881 
to 1886, after which he organized the Cork Defence Union at Cork, of 
which he was secretary and manager from 1886 to 1891, inclusive. Owing 
to the continued unsettled condition of affairs at home, he came to America 
in 1892, direct to Victoria, this province, and shortly afterward he went to 
Lytton, where he was provincial constable and collector for a year, and then 
located in Kamloops. At the latter place he was for some years assessor 



428 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and collector and mining recorder for the district. In 1900 he engaged in 
the insurance, real estate, and general brokerage business, which he has 
been successfully prosecuting down to date. Since 1901 he has been secre- 
tary of the Kamloops Agricultural Association. A member of the Masonic 
fraternity, he is a past master of his lodge. 

Mr. Beattie married, in 1872, Miss Mary Jane Beatty (not a relative), 
also a native of Ireland. Their family consists of six daughters and one 
son, named as follows: Elizabeth, Mary Jane, Harriet, Emily, Florence, 
John, Mabel. 

WILLIAM JAMES HANNA. 

W. J. Hanna, the leading undertaker in Victoria, is well known and 
prominent in business circles of the city, and takes an active part in the 
various private and public activities. His establishment is located in his 
new block on Yates street opposite the residence of the Catholic bishop, 
and there his increasing business will have most eligible quarters and the 
very best appointments. 

Mr. Hanna was born in Durham county, Ontario, March 4, 1854. He 
is of Scotch-Irish ancestry, only the present generation being native to 
Canada. His father, James Hanna, was bom in county Monahan, Ireland. 
Grandfather James Hanna was a soldier in the British service, being quar- 
tered at different places, and his son James was born while the family 
lived at county Monahan. At the close of his military service this soldier 
of the crown emigrated to Canada with his family and located on lands in 
Durham county, Ontario, where he spent the rest of his life. Mr. Hanna's 
father was reared in this locality and became a prominent importer and 
breeder of Ayrshire cattle, and did much to raise the standard of stock ex- 
cellence. His wife was Miss Sarah Jane Lang, who survives her husband 
and resides on the old Ontario^ homestead. James Hanna died of heart 
failure in 1865. He was a Presbyterian, and everywhere known as a man 
of high moral character. These parents had seven children, two of whom 
are residents of British Columbia, J. J. Hanna being a prominent undertaker 
in Vancouver. 

Mr. Hanna spent his youth on his father's stock farm, and received his 
education in the schools of his native county. In 1887 he went to^ Winnipeg 
and became interested in real estate, and later moved to Vancouver and 
made investments in that city. He left the latter city and came to Victoria 
in order to establish his present business, which has prospered from the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 429 

first. He took his professional course in the United States College of Em- 
balming at New York city, and received his diploma from there in 1893. 

June 15, 1887, Mr. Hanna was married to Miss Ida A. Preston, the 
youngest daughter of the late Major Preston. They have four children. 
They are attendants of the Metropolitan Methodist church, and are well 
known in Victoria society. They have two good residences in this city, 
one at 114 Pandora street and the other at 66 Royal street. Mr. Hanna is 
a justice of the peace, having received his appointment to that office May 
23, 1899, and was elected as alderman for the north ward for the present 
vear, and is one of the most active members of the present city council. 
His fraternal affiliations include the Masonic, Odd Fellows and Pythian 
fraternities. 

JAMES KENNEDY. 

James Kennedy, deceased, belonged to the preeminent pioneers and men 
of affairs who have made British Columbia .what it is today, who always 
wielded his influence for the welfare and progress of his city and province, 
and in whose life are found many elements of strength and character and 
high-minded personality which in all times and places are found to be the 
most important factors in a nation's or a community's stability and prosperity. 

The long career of this former citizen of New Westminster began on 
the 9th of December, 18 17, in Ballymena, near Belfast, county Antrim, Ire- 
land. His father's name was also James, of the Rampart, Ballymena. In 
1839, being then in his twenty-second year and having completed his studies 
and practical preparation for the profession of architect, Mr. Kennedy sailed 
for America. For some time he followed his profession in Rochester, New 
York, and also' traveled through Wisconsin, Illinois, and other middle west- 
ern states. He visited Chicago when the present metropolis consisted of 
a village of wooden houses, situated on a swampy site reached by stage 
coach. His inborn love for the old flag and British institutions led him to 
settle in Canada, and the latter forties and early fifties found him in Toronto. 
Some of this time was spent in Whitby, Ontario, where several buildings of 
his designing are still standing. The discovery of gold in Australia in- 
duced him to take passage on a sailing vessel for that country, which was 
then chiefly known as the dumping ground for England's convicts. Sailing 
from New York in November, 1852, six months later the southland of gold 
was reached, some of the intervening time having been spent in Cape Town, 
South Africa. After passing about a year in Australia he returned to 



I 



430 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Canada, by way of San Francisco, which was then a small city, thence down 
the California coast and across Nicaragua to the Atlantic. 

In 1854 Mr. Kennedy was happily married at Whitby, Ontario, to Miss 
Caroline, second daughter of Hon. Marshall B. Stone, state senator of Min- 
nesota. Early in the spring of 1859, after a short stay at St. Paul, Minne- 
sota, the late Mr. Kennedy and his wife started for British Columbia via 
Panama, there being no trans-continental railways in those days. After a 
tedious coasting trip of over a month New Westminster was reached. This 
settlement had just begun, the site having been located by the Royal En- 
gineers under Colonel Moody, and known as " Queensborough." The virgin 
forest had only recently and here and there been encroached upon by the ex- 
ploiters of this northwest city, and in this spot the new arrivals literally 
pitched their tents and for years sustained the usual vicissitudes of pioneers 
in a new land. As architect and builder Mr. Kennedy employed himself 
to good advantage, but he also varied his activity, as opportunity and cir- 
cumstances directed,, by teaching school, road contracting and ranching. In 
later years he superintended for the Dominion government the construction 
of the postofifice building, which has since been destroyed by fire, and for 
the provincial government the Provincial Asylum for the Insane, to which 
considerable subsequent additions have been made. A number of substan- 
tial business blocks, designed and superintended in their construction by 
Mr. Kennedy, were noticeable architectural features of the town before the 
disastrous fire of 1898. 

In addition to his other interests and activities he was an enthusiastic 
and skilled horticulturist, and planted one of the first and choicest orchards 
in the country, in the vicinity of New Westminster, which he had the satis- 
faction of bringing to a bountiful bearing condition in the later sixties. 

Mr. Kennedy always took a keen and intelligent interest in public af 
fairs, both local and general, and was interested with his sons, the Kennedy 
Brothers, during the first years that they published the daily and weekly 
Columbian, to whose columns he occasionally contributed. In religious mat- 
ters he adhered to the faith of his Presbyterian ancestry, but in his sympathy 
with every good cause and work he knew no denominational bounds. 

Ripe in years, rich with the esteem and honor of his fellow citizens, his 
life came to a close on November 23, 1902, when eighty-five years old. His 
probity of character and breadth of interests had made him well and widely 
life came to a close on November 23, 1902, when eighty-five years old. His 
wife still survives, and his children are as follows : The sons James, George, 
and Robert were the publishers and owners of the daily and weekly Colum-

biun, a history of which appears in this work. Captain Wilham Kennedy is 
master of a steamer in the fisheries protective service (federal). Thomas 
Kennedy is engaged in the tinsmith and cornice business at Vancouver, 
Miss Mary Emily Kennedy, the only daughter, resides at home with her 
mother. John Kennedy is a newspaper man, having learned the business in 
the office of the Columbian and since engaged on other papers. Benjamin 
S. Kennedy is also a newspaper man and a practical printer. Thomas and 
Benjamin are married, the others are single, 

GEORGE M. FOSTER, M. D. 

Dr. George M. Foster, engaged in the practice of medicine in Green- 
wood since 1898, was born in Pembroke, Ontario, November 20, 1875, his 
]&gt;arents being Archibald and Margaret (Rowan) Foster, who are still resi- 
dents of Pembroke, while the father, who was long engaged in merchan- 
dising, is now living a retired life in the enjoyment of a well earned rest. 

Dr. Foster entered the public schools of his native city at the usual age 
and continued his studies in the high school at Pembroke, after which he 
pursued a full course in medicine in McGill University, for he had resolved 
to make the practice of medicine his life work. After a thorough prelim- 
inary training he was graduated with the class of 1897 and was further 
qualified by nine months' practice in Victoria Hospital in Montreal. He 
came to Greenwood in 1898 and has since been a member of the medical 
fraternity, here enjoying a large and constantly growing practice. He is 
a member of the British Columbia Medical Association and of the Dominion 
Medical Association. 

Dr. Foster is interested in mining, having made judicious investment 
along this line. He has served as coroner of Greenwood since 1901 and in 
his political views he is a Conservative. Fraternally he is connected with 
Greenwood Lodge, No. 28, A. F, &amp; A. M. 

CAPTAIN DANIEL C, McMORRIS, 

Captain Daniel Chesterfield McMorris, filling the position of city clerk 
of Nelson, was the first male child born in Chesterfield, Ontario, his natal 
day iDcing February 6, 1854. His parents, William and Mary (Shield) 
McMorris, are now deceased. He was a public-school student in Markham 
and in Gait, Ontario, and he afterward entered upon an apprenticeship to 
the printing business in St. Marys, Ontario, being connected with news- 
paper work until 1875, when his health became impaired and he turned 



432 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

to sea-faring- life, hoping that it would prove advantageous to him. He 
worked on the lakes during the summer and followed printing during the 
winter months and gradually he was advanced until he became captain. He 
was thus engaged until 1881, when he returned to the journalistic field, 
becoming editor of the Meaford Mirror, continuing the publication of that 
paper until October, 1888, when he accepted a position as editor of the 
Kamloops Sentinel, remaining in charge of that paper until June, 1901, 
when he returned to seafaring life, accepting a position as captain with the 
Columbia &amp; Kootenay Steam Navigation Company on the steamer Nelson, ply- 
ing on Kootenay Lake, remaining in that capacity until March, 1903. He then 
accepted a position as city clerk of Nelson, British Columbia, and is still 
serving in that way, his public duties being discharged in a manner most 
gratifying to the municipality. 

In December, 1875, occurred the marriage of Mr. McMorris and Miss 
Lucy Publow McPherson, a resident of Kincardine, Ontario. They had 
one child, William. In December, 1881, Mr. McMorris was again married, 
his second union being with Miss Elizabeth J. Winters, of Ontario. They 
are members of the Presbyterian church and Mr. McMorris is affiliated with 
the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. 

HERBERT RIDLEY TOWNSEND. 

Herbert Ridley Townsend, who is occupying a position in the supreme 
and tounty court registry office at Rossland as district registrar, was born 
in Victoria, British Columbia, September 29, 1868, his parents being Will- 
iam B. and Eliza (Ridley) Townsend, both of whom are living in Ross- 
land. The father arrived in Victoria in January, 1858, becoming one of 
the pioneer residents of the locality, for the work of improvement and prog- 
ress had scarcely been begun throughout the province, the settlements being 
largely those of a shifting mining population drawn hither by the hope of 
the discovery of gold. He took an active and helpful part in the substan- 
tial improvement of his locality and is now one of the honored pioneer 
residents of this part of the province. 

Mr. Townsend of this review was six years of age when he accom- 
panied his parents on tlieir removal from Victoria to New Westminster. 
He attended the public schools of both cities and was graduated from the 
high school of the latter place. He afterward accepted a clerkship with the 
company that built the New Westminster &amp; Nanaimo Gas Works and 
subsequently he was a purser on his father's boat, the Gladys, on the Eraser 
river, while later he entered the employ of the Canadian Pacific railroad in 




(4m^ ^''of, 9&gt;xcxJiao^'^^^-^ 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 433 

the machine shops at Kamloops. He afterward occupied a similar position 
at Vancouver, but later resig-ned on account of his health and in 1888 went 
to New Westminster. He continued as purser on the Gladys until the boat 
was sold in 1889, in which year he entered the employ of S. T. Mackintosh 
and when the merger took place he worked for the tram company. Later 
Mr. Townsend turned his attention to the printing business, but did not 
find that a profitable field of labor and he entered the public service in May, 
1893, in the land registry office in New Westminster. In July, 1896, he 
was transferred to Rossland, where he has since remained and in the dis- 
'charge of his public duties he is prompt, .capable and reliable, having the 
entire confidence of those concerned. 

In 1899 Mr. Townsend was united in marriage to Miss Mary Augusta 
Vercoe, a resident of Toronto, and they have two children : Dorothy Frances 
and Helen Alma Ridley. The parents are members of the Church of 
England and are prominent in the social life of Rossland, having the warm 
regard of many friends. Mr. Townsend is actively interested in military 
affairs. From the 2d of October, 1885, until 1888, he was a member of the 
New Westminster Rifle Company, and from 1888 to 1896 belonged to the 
Fifth Canadian Artillery. In April, 1898, the Rocky Mountain Rangers, 
No. I, was formed and Mr. Townsend has since been a member of the 
organization, sennng as lieutenant in command since the fall of 1902. He 
is well versed in military tactics and has a well trained company noted for 
its skill and efficiency. 

JAMES ST. LEGER MAITLAND-DOUGALL. 

James St. Leger Maitland-Dougall, of Duncans, has for a number of 
years been a leading public official in the Cowichan district, holding numerous • 
offices of trust and responsibility, and his public-spirited exertions and en- 
terprise have contributed much to the substantial welfare and progress of 
his district. 

Mr. Maitland-Dougall was bom in Scotland, on January 17, 1867, a 
son of William H. and Elizabeth (Stark) Maitland-Dougall. both deceased. 
His father attained the position of admiral in the British navy, and was a 
man of strong and forceful character and eminent in every station of life. 
The son received his education in the English public schools and in Fettes 
College at Edinburgh. For three years he was a clerk in a Liverpool estab- 
lishment, and in 1886, when an ambitious and energetic youth of not yet 
twenty years, he came out to British Columbia. For the first three years he 
was engaged in farming in the Cowichan district, after which he returned to 



434 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Scotland on a visit. On his return to this country he engaged in surveying 
in this province for two years and a half, and then became an employe in 
the Dominion immigration office at Vancouver, remaining in that office a 
year and a half, until it was closed down. He then returned to the Cowichan 
district and served eight years as constable. In 1899 he was made acting 
government agent and stipendiary magistrate, and after fifteen months' serv- 
ice he received the regular appointment to these offices, which he still holds. 
His other official positions are registrar of county court, magistrate under 
the small debts act, registrar of voters, registrar of births, deaths and mar- 
riages, and assessor and collector. He owns considerable residence property 
at Duncans and in the district, and throughout has had a prosperous and 
honorable career. 

Mr. Maitland-Dougall was married in March, 1894, to Miss Winifred 
McKinstry Watson, a daughter of Dr. Watson, of England. The two chil- 
dren of this union are Hamish Kinnear and William McKinstry. Mr. Mait- 
land-Dougall affiliates with Temple Lodge No. 33, A. F. &amp; A. M., and his 
church is the Church of England. 

CHARLES HAYWARD. 

Charles Hayward (ex-mayor), arrived in Victoria in the spring of 1862, 
at once became identified with one of the city's most important early indus- 
tries, has since followed out a most successful business career, has devoted 
himself to the general welfare and progress of this city, and in all the rela- 
tions of a very busy life iSeen found on the side of right and reform and per- 
manent civic advancement. 

Mr. Hayward is an Englishman by birth, having been born in Strat- 
ford, Essex, May 12, 1839, eldest son of Charles and Harriet (Tomlinson) 
Hayward. His father was a merchant, and both parents were consistent 
members of the Church of England. Mr. Hayward received his early educa- 
tion in Salem College, Middlesex. When it became time to turn his atten- 
tion to some life work he was at fourteen years of age apprenticed to the 
carpenter and joiner's trade, and thoroughly prepared himself by seven years' 
service under all the formalities of the old style of indenture. 

In 1862 he married, and in the same year set out for the new world. 
He came round by the Isthmus of Panama and arrived in San Francisco 
late in April. There being no overland telegraph at that time his ship brought 
to that port the latest news of the American civil war, and there were large 
and excited' crowds at the wharf eager for the tidings of the conflict in the 
east. From San Francisco Mr. Hayward continued his voyage via Portland 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 4:35 

by boat to Victoria, where he arrived in May. He at once started a sash 
and door factory and engaged in contracting and building, so that he was 
one of the first connected with that Hne of business in this city, and in the 
subsequent years he has accompHshed a great deal along that line. Imme- 
diately on his location here he became interested in the city's welfare, and he 
has ever since shown his confidence in the future greatness of Victoria by 
investments in city property; and his own prosperity and interests have kept 
pace with the city's growth. 

Mr. Hayward's public career is especially notable in its place in this 
history. He was elected and served three years as councilman of his city, 
and on the progressive ticket was elected to the office of mayor. In that 
office for three successive years he used his power and influence for many 
excellent works. He actively promoted the filling up of the James Bay mud 
flat and the building of the fine causeway there, an enterprise which has 
borne good fruit and become one of great importance to the city. He also 
gave his influence to the settlement of the bridge disaster claims without fur- 
ther recourse to law, and to the rebuilding of the fine steel bridge at Point 
Ellis. He also succeeded in consolidating a portion of the city debt, whereby 
the rate-payers benefited to the extent of about four thousand dollars per 
annum, extending over twenty years. 

The school system of the city has likewise found an earnest and effective 
supporter in Mr. Hayward. He served as a member and chairman of the 
school board for fifteen consecutive years, and during that time several fine 
school buildings were erected, a local superintendent appointed, and other 
matters for the progress of education promoted. He has been president

England, in 1862, to Miss Sarah McChesney. She remained his faithful 
helpmate and life companion for thirty-nine years, and her death in 1901 
was felt as a loss not only to her immediate family but to the entire com- 
munity. She had l^een one of the first teachers in the public schools of 
Victoria, and was a greatly beloved woman, and drew to her many warm 
and devoted friends who sincerely admired her excellent qualities of heart

HORATIO WEBB. 

Horatio Webb, of Chilliwhack, has been a prosperous and progressive 
farmer in the Chilliwhack valley for over thirty years, and has applied his 
energies to his occupation so well that he is esteemed as one of the leading 
agriculturists of his vicinity. He has also manifested a public-spirited inter- 
est in the affairs of his district and municipality, and in more than one enter- 
prise and capacity has forwarded the welfare and general prosperity of Chilli- 
whack. 

Mr. Webb is a native Englishman, born at Marston, Bedfordshire, 
England, April 28, 1852, his parents, John and Caroline (Fane) Webb, being

engaged in such work until he was seventeen years old. He then emigrated 
to the new world, and after spending a summer in New York he came out 
via the Union and Central Pacific Raihvay, on the first through train to 
Oakland, California, in September^ 1869, to Chilliwhack. where he has thus 
been numbered among the enterprising citizenship for thirty-five years. The 
first two years he was in the employ of Johnathan Reece, and he then bought 
eighty acres of land and began farming on his own account. Since then he 
has owned at various times other tracts of farming land, but he now retains 
only the original beautiful and productive home place, where he has a pleas- 
ant home and is surrounded by comforts and conveniences such as his life- 
time of energetic effort has well earned. 

Besides being so active in his own private affairs, he has been a leader 
in various civic movements and undertakings. He is an active member of 
the Church of England, having been identified with that denomination in 
Chilliwhack from the beginning, and in the early days helped to bring the 
first church from Fort Douglas to Chilliwhack in canoes, a distance of sixty 
miles, crossing the Douglas lake, about thirty miles wide. For nine years he 
served as deputy sheriff under Sheriff Armstrong, and he has been assessor 
and auditor for the municipality for three years. He is a shareholder and a 
director in the Eden Bank creamery, and is a director of the New West- 
minster Fair Association, and at one time was vice-president of the Victoria 
Fair Association. He is a Conservative in politics. Fraternally he affiliates

GEORGE C. TUNSTALL. 

George C. Tunstall is a well known British Columbia pioneer, having 
made this province the field of his industry and business activity for over 
forty years. The greater part of this time has been passed in Kamloops, 
where he is a highly esteemed citizen and prominent provincial official. 
Having lived in the province for so many years, he has been a witness of 
its entire industrial growth and development. 

He was born in Montreal, Canada, December 5, 1836, a son of James 
M. and Elizabeth (Woolrich) Tunstall, both of whom are deceased. In 
1862 he crossed the plains to British Columbia, settling at Cariboo, and 
for a number of years was engaged in mining on Williams creek. In the 
fall of 1879 he went to Victoria, and in the following December was ap- 




438 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

pointed to the office of government agent at Kamloops. This was the 
beginning of his official and residential connection with Kamloops, and he 
has thus been a citizen for a quarter of a century. In 1885 he was appointed 
gold commissioner for the Similkameen district, which office he held until 
the spring of 1889. He was then appointed and served for two years as 
gold commissioner for West Kootenay, until his appointment as govern- 
ment agent and gold commissioner at Kamloops, offices which he still ad- 
ministers. He is also district registrar of the supreme court, registrar of 
the county court and stipendiary magistrate. 

Mr. Tunstall was married in 1865 to Miss Annie Morgan, who died 
in' 1873, leaving two children, Charles Augustus and George Christie. The 
family are adherents of the Church of England. 

JOHN DEAN. 

John Dean, who is engaged in the real estate and mining brokerage busi- 
ness in Rossland, was born in Stretton, Cheshire, England, on the 17th of 
December, 1850. His father, who was a farmer by occupation, died in the 
year 1856 and his mother passed away in 1858, so that he was left an orphan 
when only eight years of age. He then went to live with relatives at War- 
rington, England, and subsequently went to Liverpool under the direction of 
the executors of his father's estate. At Warrington he served a term of ap- 
prenticeship with the firm of Gibson &amp; Sons, contractors and builders, during 
which time he gained intimate and accurate knowledge of the business. The 
opportunities for advancement in the new world, however, proved very 
attractive to him and on the 2d of January, 1873, he left Liverpool for To- 
ronto, where he remained until May, 1876. He then attended the Centen- 
nial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and following his visit there 
made his way to New York City. On the 17th of February, 1877, he started 
by steamer for Galveston, Texas, where he spent five years in varying peri- 
ods in the principal towns of that state. In 1882 he went to England, intend- 
.ing to remain, but not finding conditions favorable there for business advance- 
ment he only paid a visit to his native land. He went to both London and 
Paris and afterward sailed again for New York, where he arrived in April, 
1883. He thence proceeded to Washington, D. C, where the summer was 
spent, leaving there in December for San Francisco and stopping off at Kan- 
sas City, Omaha, Salt Lake and Leadville. After a sojourn of four months 
in San Francisco, Mr. Dean went to Victoria, British Columbia, and the fol- 
lowing year he secured a building contract on the Canadian Pacific Railroad, 
at which he worked until 1886. In that year he joined the rush for the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 439 

Granite creek placer diggings and an extract from his diary dated April 4, 
1886, says : " Went to church held by Mr. Irwin, about twelve men pres- 
ent. Bought twO' claims on Granite creek, sold half interest to a partner 
and spent six months work and twelve hundred dollars in prospecting without 
finding paying ground. Made a present of the outfit to my partner and 
tramped to Hope on the Fraser river, a distance of seventy miles." The fol- 
lowing decade Mr. Dean was engaged in contracting and building at Vic- 
toria and also in real estate speculation, where he still owns considerable real 
estate in the city, and suburbs, and where he ultimately hopes to make his 
home. He came to Rossland April 26, 1896, and opened a real estate and 
mining brokerage office. Since that time he has secured a good clientage 
along these lines, making judicious investment both for himself and others 
and negotiating many important real estate and mine transfers. 

In 1900 Mr. Dean was one of Rossland's aldermen, serving as chair- 
man of the board of public works. In 1903 he was elected mayor arid was 
one of the mayors who met President Roosevelt in Spokane. His interest 
in community is deep and sincere and his efforts in behalf of public progress 
have been far-reaching and beneficial. Mr. Dean is a member of Columbia 
Commandery, K. T., at Washington, D. C., and he belongs to the Indepen- 
dent Order of Odd Fellows and the Encampments. A history of pioneer 
experiences in the far west is familiar to him not as a matter of record but 
as a matter of experience and with the substantial improvement of the coun- 
try he has been closely associated, putting forth l^eneficial and far-reaching 
effort to further improvement and substantial upbuilding. 

JOHNSTONE PRESCOTT MYERS GRAY. 

Johnstone Prescott Myers Gray is identified with the local profession for 
which by natural attributes and thorough preparation and research he has 
proved his fitness, realizing that in this calling more than in almost any other 
success depends upon the force of the indi\iduality and that as an exponent 
of the law he must display in unusual degree a keenness of power of analyza- 
tion and logical summarizing of the chief points in a case. Mr. Gray has 
proved himself a leader in attaining the creditable position which he now holds 
as a representative of the bar at Greenwood. 

A native of Halifax, Nova Scotia, born on the 20th of January. 1872, 
Mr. Gray is a son of W. Myers and Laliah W. (Richie) Gray, both resi- 
dents of New Westminster, British Columbia. Their son was educated in 
St. Stephens College in New York, and following his graduation he came 
to British Columbia in 1891, being then a young man of nineteen years. He 



440 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

turned his attention to engineering work and spent two years in the con- 
struction of the New Westminster water works. He then studied law with 
his father and was admitted to the bar in November, 1898. He removed 
to Greenwood in 1899 and entered into partnership with Judge Leaney, the 
present county judge, Mr. Gray has served as city soHcitor .for four years. 
In addition to his practice he is interested in mining, having recognized the 
opportunity for judicious investment in mining property in the province. 
His poHtical views are in accord with the principles of the Conservative 
party. 

JOHN STILWELL CLUTE. 

John Stilwell Clute, who is engaged in the life insurance business in 
Rossland, is a native son of the province, his birth having occurred in New 
Westminster, March 23, 1867, his parents being J. S. and Jennie (Clarkson) 
Clute, who are residents of New Westminster, the father occupying the posi- 
tion of inspector of customs there at the time of this writing in the winter 
of 1904-5. 

John S. Clute began his education in the public schools of his native city 
and progressed by successive steps until he had completed the high school 
course, after which he became a student in the collegiate institute at New 
Westminster. W^hen he had put aside his text books he accepted a position 
in the land registry office, where he remained for a short time and was then 
articled to W. Norman Bole (now judge) and H. Fiemies Clinton as a 
student at law. Following careful and thorough preparation for the bar 
he was admitted in 1893 and subsequently engaged in active practice with 
his former preceptor Mr. Clinton until 1895 when he came to Rossland and 
entered upon practice alone. He afterward formed a partnership with J. A. 
Macdonald, leader of the Provincial Liberal party, and was with him until 
1902. He has since been engaged in the life insurance business and has 
secured a good clientage, writing many policies each year that represent a 
large investment. He is now the Rossland representative for the United 
States Fidelity &amp; Guarantee Company, the Travelers Accident Company and 
the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. 

In 1893 was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Clute and Miss Mary Louise 
Roberton Walker, a daughter of Rev. James Walker, of Edinburgh, Scot- 
land, and their attractive home in Rossland is celebrated for its gracious and 
charming hospitality. Mr. Clute is very prominent in Masonic circles, is a 
past master of Corinthian Lodge No. 27, A. F. &amp; A. M., G. R. B. C. He is 
also past principal of Rossland Chapter No. 122, R. A. M. ; and constable of

and teachings of the craft, while his life in many respects is an exemplifica- 
tion of its beneficent spirit. Mr. Clute is a member of Rossland lodge. Sons 
of St. George; is a past master of the Ancient Order of United Workmen 
at Rossland; is a charter member of Rossland Lodge No. 31, K. P. ; and past 
chief ranger of the Canadian Order of Foresters. He likewise belongs to 
Post No. I, of the Native Sons of British Columbia. His religious faith is 
Presbyterian. In his political views Mr. Clute is a Conservative. He has 
been alderman of Rossland since 1898 and served as license and police com- 
missioner of the city for several terms, while in 1902 he w^as elected mayor 
and discharged the duties of the position with such capability that he was re- 
elected in 1904 and is therefore the present incumbent. He is a justice of 
the peace for the province and has handled the reins of municipal government 
in an able manner — has made a close study of conditions existing here and 
has so utilized the means at hand as to make his services of direct and perma- 
nent good to the city. He holds the general welfare above personal aggran- 
dizement and over the record of his public career there falls no shadow of 
wrong or suspicion of evil. 

JAMES W. BLAND. 

James W. Bland, of Derriquin, Victoria, came to British Columbia 
when this was a great undeveloped district rich in its natural resources, 
yet having few settlers to enjoy its benefits and develop its business possi- 
bilities. He landed from the steamer Forward at Victoria on the 3rd of 
February, 1859, ^"^ '^ "o^v numbered among the pioneer settlers of the 
Province, who are wide and favorably known. He was born at Callao, 
Peru, on the 3rd of Febitiary, 1853. His father, James Bland, was a native 
of London, England, born September 17, 1829. The ancient family of 
Bland came over to England with William the Conqueror from Normandy 
and settled in Yorkshire. The ancient name was de Blande, and one, the 
Rev. John Blande, was burned at Smithfield in 1555, from whom descends 
John Bland of Sedbergh, Yorkshire, who was father of the Rev. James 
Bland, M. A., vicar of Killarney, archdeacon of Aghadoe and dean of 
Ardfert, admitted to St. John's College, Cambridge, in May, 1684; married 
Lucy, daughter of Sir Francis Brewster, Kt., of Westminster, Lord Mayor 
of Dublin, and Arabella Herbert, his wife, and granddaughter of Edward 
Herbert, Esq., of Muckross (son of Thomas Herbert and Mary Kenny of 



442 . BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Killinagh, county Kerry), and Agnes Crosbie, daughter of Patrick Crosbie, 
of Tubrid, and had issue. His second son, Nathaniel Bland, LL. D., judge 
of the prerogative court of Dublin and vicar general of the diocese of Ard- 
fert and Aghadoe, married first Diana, only daughter of Nicholas Kenieys, 
Esq., and had issue, first, George Bland, second, John Bland, who married 
Miss Grace Phillips, whose daughter became known as Mrs. Jordan, the 
celebrated actress, third. Rev. James Bland of Derriquin Castle, county 
Kerry, Ireland, and vicar of Ballyheigh, who married first Elizabeth, daugh- 
ter of Christopher Julian, and secondly, Barbara, daughter of Nash, 

Esq., and by the former had issue only. His second son, James Bland, 
married Miss Anna Mahoney of Killarney in 1806, and left Ireland and 
went to London, England, in 18 12, and had with other issue an only son 
James Bland, bom in 1829, and married July i, 1850, Miss Elizabeth Ever- 
son, daughter of Joseph Everson, Esq., of London, and had issue. 

The father of our subject was educated in England and served in the 
Royal Navy until 1850, when he went to Callao, Peru, where he was en- 
gaged in business until he removed to Victoria in 1859. He was a marine 
engineer and served in that capacity on the famous steamer Beaver, on the 
Maude and on the Otter. He died on the 17th of March, 1894, at the age 
of sixty-four years and six months. His wife, who shared with him in the 
experience of pioneer life of this section of the country, is now in her seventy- 
fifth year, her birth having occurred on the 12th of January, 1830. This 
worthy couple were the parents of ten children, of whom six are now living, 
all being residents of British Columbia, namely, Henry Joseph, John, James, 
Joseph, Elizabeth, who is now the wife of P. R. Smith, and Frederick 
William. 

James William Bland pursued his education at the Jessop school in 
Victoria and has led a very active life. In 1889 he was appointed usher 
of the supreme court of the province of British Columbia and is filling that 
position at this writing. 

In 1875 ^i^- Bland was married to Miss Hannah Elizabeth Clunk, a 
native of London, England, and the eldest daughter of William Thomas 
Clunk. Two children have been born unto them: James Allan, whose 
birth occurred June 6, 1876; and William Henry, born September 10, 1877. 
The elder son is a clerk in the office of the Law Society of British Columbia, 
while the younger son is a druggist. Both are young men of good business 
ability and much prominence and are still living at home with their parents. 
They take great pleasure in devoting their leisure hours to beautify the 
grounds around the family residence. James A. is particularly interested 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 443 

in the growing of prize flowers, and his sweet peas have won all the first 
prizes at the shows held in Victoria and Vancouver for the past three years, 
and' the sweet pea vines have attained the remarkable height of fourteen 
feet. These young men are of the ninth generation of the Blands whose 
history is a matter of authentic record. In England and in Ireland the 
family has been represented in the nobility.* The Blands of the United 
States are also descended from the same ancestry, and the United States 
senator of that name, the distinguished champion of free silver, is of the 
same stock. 

James W. Bland is a member of the Ancient Order of United Work- 
men, and for over twenty years he was a member of the Victoria volunteer 
fire department, belonging to Deluge Company No. i, and to Hook and 
Ladder Company No. i. A resident of Victoria from his early boyhood 
days he has witnessed much of its development. 

WILLIAM WADDS. 

William Wadds, who is filling the position of postmaster at Rossland, 
to which he was appointed in October, 1895, having been the incumbent since 
that time, was born in the north of Ireland, January 22, 1867, his parents 
being George and Margaret (Bell) Wadds, both of whom have passed away. 
William Wadds left Ireland when ten years of age and crossed the Atlantic 
to Ontario. His education was acquired at Barrie and was afterward arti- 
cled to the jewelry business in Barrie and also served a part of his appren- 
ticeship in Toronto. He followed that pursuit for fifteen years and in 189 1 
he arrived in British Columbia, locating first at Vancouver, where he fol- 
lowed his trade until 1895. In that year he came to Rossland and for a 
short period was engaged in the jewelry business here on his own account. 
In October of the same year, however, he was appointed postmaster of Ross- 
land and has since administered the affairs of that office, proving a capable 
official. 

In 1897 M'"- Wadds was united in marriage to Miss Ethel Morris, a 
resident of Vancouver and they have one child, George Morris. They held 
membership in the Episcopal church and have a large circle of warm friends 
in this locality, being held in favorable regard by those who knew him.

J. S. C. FRASER. 

Honored and respected by all there is no citizen of Rossland who occu- 
pies a more enviable position in financial circles than does J. S. C. Fraser, 
who for twenty-six years has been in the employ of the Bank of Montreal. 
He entered the services of that institution at Ottawa, Ontario, and was after- 
ward with the branch house at St. Johns, New Brunswick. Subsequently 
he was located at different times in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, in con- 
nection with the banking establishments there and in 1888 he came to Brit- 
ish Columbia as accountant in the New Westminster branch. In July, 1896, 
he was appointed manager of the Rossland branch and has since served here. 
He is thoroughly familiar with the banking business in every department and 
in control of the institution of which he is now manager he has shown excel- 
lent business ability, making the institution one of the strong financial con- 
cerns of this locality and securing for it a desirable patronage. 

Mr. Fraser has been very active and influential in community affairs 
and in athletics. He is recognized as the leading spirit in public interests 
and his co-operation may always be counted upon to aid in the advancement 
of every measure for the general good. He was president of the board of 
trade for two years and it was at his suggestion that the associate boards 
of trade of eastern British Columbia came into existence. He introduced 
the idea in his annual message to the Rossland board of trade and fostered 
the measure until it became an actuality. He was then elected the first presi- 
dent of this association and through his active connection with the office he 
has done much to promote trade interests in his section of the province. 

Mr. Fraser is also deeply interested in athletics and is president of the 
Rossland Curling &amp; Skating Rink Company and also president of the Koot- 
enay Curling Association. He takes great interest in anything along athletic 
lines and he was elected the first president of the Rossland Club, which was 
established in 1897, and has continuously held that office. He is regarded as 
one of the foremost citizens of the community, active in public life as well 
as banking circles, and his efforts for the general good have l^een far-reach- 
ing and beneficial. 

KENNETH C. B. FRITH. 

Kenneth C. B. Frith, filling the position of postmaster of Greenwood, 
was born in St. John, New- Brunswick, April 2, 1868, his father being H. W. 
Frith, now deceased. He was a public school student in his native city and 
after putting aside his text books was engaged in the insurance business for 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 445 

a short time. Later he went tO' Florida, where he was connected with the 
orange trade for four years, when the "big freeze" of 1890 ruined his trees 
and he returned to St. John. He then entered the hardware business, in which 
field of commercial activity he remained for ten years and in 1898 he came 
to Greenwood, where he has since lived. Entering the employ of Post- 
master King he remained with him for six months and upon his resignation 
Mr. Frith was appointed to fill the office in January, 1900, and has since acted 
in that capacity. He is a member of the Greenwood Lodge No. 29, K. P. 

THOMAS RUSSELL MORROW. 

The commercial activity of Rossland finds a worthy representative in 
Thomas Russell Morrow, who is conducting a drug store there. He was 
born in Orangeville, Ontario, February 9, 1862, and is a son of Allan L. and 
Elizabeth (Robinson) Morrow, both of whom are deceased. The son was 
educated at Owen Sound, attending the public schools until he had mastered 
the branches taught in the high school. He afterward took a full course in 
Ontario College of Pharmacy and thus prepared for the practical duties of 
his active and responsible business career. He was articled in Chadsworth 
and served for four years, when on the completion of his term of indenture 
he accepted a position in the Winnipeg Drug Hall, where he remained for 
three years. He then returned to Toronto and was there engaged in the 
drug business for three years, after which he came to British Columbia in 
1888. Settling in Vancouver he opened a drug store on his own account 
and conducted it until 1895, when, feeling that he would have a still more 
advantageous field of labor in Rossland he came to this place and in the 
fall of 1895 opened his drug store which he has since conducted with con- 
stantly increasing and gratifying success. He has a good store well equipped 
with a large line of drugs and other goods found in a first class establish- 
ment of this character and a liberal patronage is accorded him in recognition 
of his honorable dealing and his earnest desire to please his patrons. He 
has been largely interested in mining, in which he has been very successful 
and he still has extensive mining property, whereby his income has been ma- 
terially increased. 

In 1889 occurred the marriage of Mr. Morrow and Miss Isabelle Pear- 
sail, a daughter of George Pearsall, a hardware merchant of Toronto. Mr. 
Morrow belongs to the Ancient Order of Foresters and to the Presbyterian 
church, and is interested in all that pertains to the intellectual, moral and 
social progress of his adopted city. Coming to British Columbia with the 
hope of bettering his financial condition he has found here the opportunities 



446 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

he sought and by using the advantages which surround every individual he 
has worked his way steadily upward to a position of business prominence 
while he is now enjoying a comfortable competence as the reward of his 
capable management and judicious investment. 

WILLIAM SHANNON. 

William Shannon, of Vancouver, British Columbia, who is superin- 
tending his real estate and invested interests, is numbered among the pio- 
neers of British Columbia of 1862. At that time a few courageous frontiers- 
men hazarded to locate within the borders of the province, which was, how- 
ever, a wild district; its lands unclaimed, its resources undeveloped and 
the country but very little explored, and the greater part of it had never 
been seen by white man. The work of progress and improvement was a 
thing of the future and there was little promise of early rapid growth. In 
the years which have since passed, Mr. Shannon has witnessed a wonderful 
transformation and has largely aided in the labors which have brought the 
change. Watchful of business opportunity ' he has made judicious invest- 
ments as occasion has offered and is now the possessor of valuable realty 
interests in Vancouver and elsewhere in this province. 

A native of Ireland, Mr. Shannon was born near Sligo on the 19th 
of February, 1843. His father, Peter Shannon, was born near London- 
derry, and among his ancestors were several of the apprentice boys who 
closed the gates and cried " no surrender " when the siege of that old his- 
torical city occurred. After arriving at years of maturity, Peter Shannon 
wedded Miss Catherine Lytle, also a native of Sligo, whose father was a 
local preacher under the Rev. John Wesley, and traveled in company with 
him in different parts of Ireland, assisting him in establishing missions. 
When Miss Lytle was quite a girl, most of her i&gt;eople moved to the state 
of Ohio and settled in what is now the city of Cincinnati ; and their descend- 
ants are now among the most influential men of that city. Mr. Shannon's 
father was also connected with the first Methodist preachers in the north 
of Ireland and became a local preacher among them; he remained so until 
his death, having pursued this work for over forty years, and when his son 
William was six years of age he crossed the Atlantic with his family, in- 
cluding his wife, six sons and four daughters. He settled in the township 
of Ops, county Victoria, province of Ontario, near Lindsay, where he pur- 
chased land. There he improved a farm and made a good home, carrying 
on agricultural pursuits for many years. He did all in his power to advance 
the moral, intellectual and political interests of his community; was a mem- 




/iW- jMyn^i^uyh/ 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 447 

ber of the township council and much respected by all with whom he came 
in contact. 

William Shannon was reared upon his father's farm and his education 
was acquired in the public schools nearby. He was in the twentieth year 
when he came to the far west to seek a fortune. After remaining a short 
time in California, in Oregon and Washington, he continued his way north- 
ward and arrived in British Columbia in June, 1863. He then made his 
way into the mining regions, where he had the usual successes and losses 
that fall to the lot of the miner. In 1865 he started the first trading post 
that was ever started, in the south end of the Okanagan country, where he 
remained for a short time, and was very successful in business. At that 
time ihe first and great gold excitement broke out in the Kootenay country, 
which is known as the big bend of the Columbia river. Mr. Shannon was 
among the first who fitted out at Fort Colwell with lx&gt;ats, etc., and ascended 
the Columbia river to its head waters. He visited the ground where the 
town of Nelson now stands, and also the Wild Horse creek and Columbia 
lakes. In 1866 he took charge of a small party who started from the Big 
Bend mines on the Columbia river in order to explore the country from 
the head of the Columbia ri^'er, or the mouth of Canoe creek into the Rockies 
and from there northward into the Peace river country. It was at that time 
a very hazardous undertaking and but very little was known of that unex- 
plored region. Their provisions l&gt;ecame exhausted, and for a length of 
time they subsisted on what they could catch by trapping and hunting. The 
party here divided, and Mr. Shannon and another man made their way 
back to the mines. The others went eastward to Fort Edmonton, and after 
wards they went north and were for three years exploring the McKenzie 
river country, during which time they never saw a human being. They 
followed up the de'Lure river until they came to Diese lake, where they 
discovered the first gold that was found in the Cassiar country. Here they 
met an Indian trapi^er, who told them where they were; that they were 
within one hundred and fifty miles of a Hudson's Bay fort. Until this time 
they were at a loss to know their location. 

The follow^ing season Mr. Shannon continued his explorations in the 
north, and for a time engaged in fur trading with the Indians, with fair 
success. It was at this period of his life that he acquired his very extensive 
knowledge of the countr}-. At this time the Western Union Telegraph Com- 
pany were exploring for their line from here to Behring Straits. Mr. Shan- 
non listed with the company as one of the explorers, but after a few months' 
preparatory work, the Atlantic cable proving a success, the company aban- 



448 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

doned their works. About this time also Mr. Shannon, in connection with 
his brother Thomas, who accompanied him from the east, took up farms in 
the Chilhwack valley and was among the first settlers there. At that time 
there were no roads in any part of the Lower PYaser, but what produce the 
few farms grew at Chilliwack was shipped by boat to Yale, which was the 
only market in the lower country at that time. Later he became interested 
in the freighting business of the Cariboo mines and drove the first big 
wagon into Williams Creek. A short time afterwards, he went into placer 
mining extensively, and was considered by many as being among the best 
miners in the country, and assisted in making improvements upon the means 
of saving the fine gold. He was later again engaged extensively in farming 
in connection with his brother in the Chilliwack country. By this time quite 
a number of people had taken up farms along the Fraser, and farming be- 
came quite an industry, and the government gave the first assistance in the 
shape of building roads. A deputation from the settlement in Chilliwack 
went to Victoria to prevail upon the government to establish municipal 
councils in different localities. Mr. Shannon was one of that deputation 
and helped to draft the first municipal act that was passed by the government 
of British Columbia. Later on the Chilliwack settlement was formed into 
a municipality, which was the first in the province. 

At this time quite an immigration was coming to the Fraser valley. 
The lands were then unsurveyed and very little known about them. Mr. 
Shannon then turned his attention to assisting in the settlement of the lands 
along the Fraser; he spent much time in acquiring information and after- 
wards assisting settlers to locate. The land law required that a post was 
to be put in, and each man described his boundaries from that post; and 
those who were unacquainted with the work found it very difficult. Mr. 
Shannon located a great number of settlers in different parts of the Fraser, 
more particularly the Chilliwack country, which was nearly entirely settled 
through his efforts, and he never charged one dollar for his services which 
he rendered to those settlers. About this time the government constructed 
the main trunk wagon road through the Fraser, which runs from Ladners 
through to Chilliwack. This was a great assistance to those who were anx- 
ious to settle upon land. After the completion of this road Mr. Shannon, 
in connection with his brother Thomas, purchased land situated in Clover 
valley and shortly afterwards commenced farming that land. The wild 
clover grew in this valley abundantly, and it was when addressing a letter 
soon after their arrival there that Mr. Shannon gave the valley its present 
name, "Clover Valley," which is one of the prettiest and most prosperous 



BRITISH COLUMBIA . 4:49 

settlements on the Fraser river. For some years after this Mr. Shannon 
engaged extensively in the lumber business, with which he was very suc- 
cessful. He has b€en considered an expert in valuing standing timber, and 
has given much valuable information in this connection. He is quoted by 
some of the best commercial papers as the most expert man in this line on 
the Pacific coast. 

In 1886 Mr. Shannon started on an extended exploration. He spent 
that summer in the northern country and towards the coast. He traveled 
through the whole of the Chilcotin country and north near the Skeena river. 
Some time after he submitted a report of the northern country to the gov- 
ernment, and acting upon his suggestions they sent surveyors to the north 
and made some surveys and mapped out part of the country described by 
Mr. Shannon. That same year in tKe fall he visited his old home near To- 
ronto, Ontario, which he had not seen for over twenty-five years. He also 
traveled extensively through different parts of the states during the same 
year. While in the east he was married on the 15th of December, 1886, to 
Miss Eliza Mclndoo, who was born and educated there, and is a daughter 
of William Mclndoo, who still resides there, having come to the new world 
from county Cavan, Ireland. The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Shannon has 
been blessed with one son, William Lloyd Shannon. 

Mr. Shannon settled in the city of Vancouver in March, 1887, and 
engaged in the real estate and commission business ; since then he has trav- 
eled a great deal throughout the whole province, also through the northwest, 
and he has ever been very active in promoting the welfare and progress of 
the province of British Columbia, and his name is inseparably associated 
with its early history. He has been instrumental in inducing immigration 
here. In 1889 Mr. Shannon was the author of a very interesting pamphlet, 
entitled "British Columbia and Its Resources," and wherein he dealt with 
the whole province in sections, according to the mountain ranges, giving the 
area of farming and pasture land, also the mining resources. It has been 
stated by many of the leading newspapers of the country that this is the 
most reliable and comprehensive pamphlet that has ever been written on 
British Columbia; ten thousand of these were published in England. Mr. 
Shannon has been employed by railway companies and the government to 
give information regarding the geography of the province generally, and 
he receives communications from men in different parts of the world request- 
ing information on this subject, and is considered to be the best authority 
on this matter in British Columbia. Besides this many of the banks and 
loan companies have employed Mr. Shannon to value and estimate prop- 



450 ■ BRITISH COLUMBIA 

erties, both mineral, timber and land. In public affairs Mr. Shannon has 
taken an active and helpful interest. He served as a member of the first 
grand jury of the town, and his influence has ever been on the side of right, 
order, reform and improvement. He has on numerous occasions acted as 
guide to parties scaling the highest mountains of British Columbia and else- 
where. 

Mr. Shannon and his wife are active and helpful members of the Meth- 
odist church, contributing generously to its support. He was a member of 
the lx&gt;ard of trustees when the Wesleyan Methodist church edifice was 
erected, has also served as steward, and has been very active and zealous 
in promoting the religious interests of the town. He was also prominent 
in the establishing of the Y. M. C. A. work, and indeed has been active and 
liberal in promoting all enterprises for the benefit of Vancouver and the 
province. We might here state that Mr. Shannon's eldest brother was a 
Methodist minister in Ontario for several years previous to his death, which 
occurred some years ago. 

WILLIAM GRAHAM McMYNN. 

William, Graham McMynn is well known as a public official who in 
office is ever loyal to the trust reposed in him and capable in his discharge 
of the duties that advance the welfare and general prosperity of the com- 
munity. He is now gold commissioner and government agent for the Green- 
wood mining division ; is stipendiary magistrate for Yale and Kootenay 
counties with jurisdiction under the small debts act, registrar of the supreme 
court, registrar of the county court and clerk of the peace. 

Mr. McMynn was born in Glenvarnoch, Scotland, March 14, 1864, his 
parents being David and Annie (Graham) McMynn. His father is de- 
ceased, but the mother is living in Scotland. Mr. McMynn of this review 
having acquired his early education, became a student at Ewart Institute at 
Newton Stewart and for six months after leaving school he was with an 
uncle, who was a lumber merchant of Carlisle and also a ship owner, being 
a member of the firm of Graham, Anderson &amp; Company. He then went to 
London, England, and entered the service of Moffatt &amp; Company, whole- 
sale tea merchants wath whom he continued for three and a half years. In 
August, 1884, he arrived in British Columbia and resided for six months 
on the delta below New Westminster, but in the spring of 1885 l"*^ w^"^^ to 
Spallumcheen country and worked on the public roads under foreman Wal- 
ker. In the following fall he removed to the vicinity of Rock creek and 
secured a ranch, beginning its development and improvement, but in the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 451 

spring of 1886 he returned to Scotland for a trip, coming again to America 
in the fall of 1887. He then took up another place in Myers creek, adjoining 
the international boundary line and there conducted his ranch until 1892, 
when he entered the government service as constable and later in the same 
year he was made mining recorder for the Kettle river mining division. . In 
1893 the office was removed to Rock creek and in 1895 ^o Midway, at which 
place Mr. McMynn remained until 1900 when the office was again removed 
to Greenwood. 

Mr. McMynn is an interested member of the Masonic fraternity, active 
in the work of the craft and is now serving as district deputy grand master 
for district number 7. He also 1&gt;elongs to the Independent Order of Odd 
Fellows and religiously is connected with the Presbyterian church. On the 
29th of October, 1890, he was married to Miss Mary Turner, a daughter of 
William Turner, of Millbrook, Ontario, and they have one daughter, Alice. 

SAMUEL PARKER TUCK. 

Samuel Parker Tuck, a prominent representative of the official interests 
of Nelson and the Kootenay country, has for a number of years figured prom- 
inently in the work of development and improvement in this portion of 
America and his efforts have been so discerningly directed along well defined 
lines of labors that they have become valued resultant factors in bringing 
about the present high state of civilization and improvement which char- 
acterize the country at the present time. He was- born in St. John, New 
Brunswick, April 25, 1837, his parents being Moses and Elizabeth (Travis) 
Tuck, both now deceased. The father was a prominent lumberman, con- 
ducting an extensive business. His brother, William H. Tuck, is now chief 
justice of the supreme court of New Brunswick. Samuel Parker Tuck 
acquired his early education in the grammar schools of New Brunswick and 
afterward attended Amherst College at Amherst, Massachusetts, where he 
completed a full course by graduation. He then matriculated in Harvard 
University, where he pursued a course in engineering under Professor Eustis 
and following his graduation within the classic walls of that honored edu- 
cational center he returned to New Brunswdck, where he became connected 
with the engineering corps in the construction work of the Inter-Colonial 
Railway, being thus engaged until the completion of the line. He was after- 
ward connected with similar work on the St. John &amp; Maine Road, now a 
portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, extending between St. John and 
Montreal, 

The year 1880 witnessed the arrival of Mr. Tuck in British Columbia, 



46S BRITISH COLUMBIA 

where he joined in the construction of the Canadian Pacific road from Yale 
west, having- charge of the building from Lytton to Spences bridge. He 
was here for four years, after which he turned his attention to provincial land 
surveying with headquarters at Victoria, being thus engaged until 1892, 
when he came to the Kootenay country. He early had the prescience to dis- 
cern what the future had in store for this great undeveloped district. Real- 
izing- its great natural resources he resolved to be among those whose labors 
should at once prove of benefit to the country and also a source of profitable 
income to themselves. He continued the work of surveying at Nelson and 
Kaslo until 1899, when he was appointed sheriff by Joseph Martin and is 
still occupying that position, discharging his duties with loyalty and fidelity 
that are above question. 

Mr. Tuck has had a varied newspaper experience in connection with 
other business duties. In 1878 he assisted in founding the St. John Sim, 
now the leading newspaper of St. John, New Brunswick, and it was begun 
as a campaign paper and entered upon an era of prosperity that has since con- 
tinued, the paper steadily growing in value and influence in that locality. 

On the 29th of July, 1873, at Dalhousie, New Brunswick, Mr. Tuck 
was united in marriage to Miss Sarah Morse, a daughter of James S. Morse, 
a barrister, practicing before the supreme court of New Brunswick. Her 
mother was a representative of a branch of tjie noted Campbell family of 
Scotland. Mr. and Mrs. Tuck have three children: Douglas C. who is a 
resident of New Westminster and occupies a position in the dominion public 
works office; Edward S., living in Victoria; and Isla, at home. The par- 
ents are members of the Church of England and Mr. Tuck is registrar of the 
synod of the diocese of Kootenay. As a citizen he has fostered every meas- 
ure calculated to prove of direct g-ood in reclaiming this district for the pur- 
poses of civilization. The pioneer experiences in the northwest are familiar 
to him for only a few brief years have passed since this was an almost unin- 
habited district, yet today the citizens of Nelson enjoy practically all of the 
advantages known to the older east and they have been established in a 
country rich in its splendid resources and possibilities. 

ARTHUR MURDOCH WHITESIDE. 

Arthur Murdoch Whiteside, a barrister practicing at the city of Green- 
wood, was born in Toronto, Ontario, in 1876. His father was Daniel White- 
side, one of the early pioneers of British Columbia, well known in the Cari- 
boo country, which he entered in 1859, being successful in his operations 
there. He died in July, 1904. He married in 1873 Miss Ruth White, of

Toronto. Arthur M. Whiteside was educated in British Cokimbia. His 
law studies were pursued in the office of Chief Justice McColl at New 
Westminster and he was called to the bar in 1897. He then opened an 
office for practice in Rossland, but after remaining there for two years he 
came to Greenwood in the fall of 1898 and has since made his home in this 
place. He is solicitor for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, for the 
Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Montreal &amp; Boston Copper Company, 
thus representing several important corporations as well as many private 
parties whose litigation comes before the local and supreme courts. Mr. 
Whiteside is prominently connected with the Masonic fraternity. 

ARTHUR W. VOWELL. 

The history of Arthur W. Vowell presents many qualities worthy the 
highest admiration. His triumph over financial reverses, his overcoming 
entirely by his own efforts of obstacles such as confront every young man 
who starts without friends or capital in a new country, his marked fidelity 
and capability in the discharge of official service, all entitle him to more than 
passing notice in the annals of British Columbia, where he is now filling 
the position of Indian superintendent. 

Mr. Vowell is a native of Ireland, and springs from one of the very 
old Anglo-Irish families of that country, the ancestry being traced back to 
the early part of the fifteenth century. He was bom in Clonmel, county 
Tipperary, on the 17th of September, 1841. His father, Richard Prender- 
gast Vowell, was a prominent Irish lawyer, who married Elizabeth Richards 
Bulkeley, a native of county Wicklow, where her father, a captain in the 
yeomanry, held large property interests. They were members of the Church 
of England, and both lived to advanced age, Mr. Vowell passing away at 
the age of eighty-six years, while his wife was considerably over ninety 
years of age at the time of her death. They were the parents of thirteen 
children, of whom Arthur W. Vowell is the twelfth in order of birth and 
the only one residing in British Columbia. 

i\fter attending the grammar schools of Clonmel, Arthur W. Vowell 
continued his education under the direction of a private tutor, until 1858, 
when he in common with many other young men in Ireland obtained a 
commission in the Irish militia, the regiment doing garrison duty in Eng- 
land until i860, when he retired as senior lieutenant. In the year 1861 Mr. 
Vowell left Great Britain for British Columbia, coming by way of the Isth- 
mus of Panama and San Francisco. He landed at Esquimault, in February, 
1862, and in the early summer went to the Cariboo mines, w^here he made 



464 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

many efforts to improve his fortune, but without success. When his money 
was expended, and there being no prospect of his being able to better his 
position, he returned to the coast, stopping en route to work on the Cariboo 
wagon road, where forty-five dollars a month and board was to be had for 
honest labor with the pick and shovel. Later he proceeded to Victoria, where 
he took contracts to clear lots and split rails, and did any kind of independent 
manual labor that would yield him an honest living and gain him a new 
start in life. 

In 1864 Mr. Vowell joined the civil service of British Columbia, and in 
1866 went to Big Bend during the excitement there, being appointed chief 
constable, which office he filled for six years, until the federation was con- 
summated. He was then given charge of the Kootenay district as gold 
commissioner and stipendiary magistrate. In 1873 he was removed to Omi- 
neca, where he served in a similar capacity until 1874, when he was ordered 
to Cassiar, where gold had been recently discovered. In the fall of that 
year, however, he resigned his position in the government service, and in 
1875, at the request of the government, he went to^ Kootenay tO' meet Major 
General Sir Selby E. Smithe and party, when that distinguished officer made 
his first journey overland to British Columbia. 

Mr. Vowell's public service was afterward in another department, for in 
1875 he was elected a member of the provincial legislative assembly as senior 
representative from the Kootenay district. In the spring of 1876 he resigned 
his seat in the local parliament and re-entered the government service, pro- 
ceeding to the mining district of Cassiar as gold commissioner and stipend- 
iary magistrate, etc., where he remained in charge until the spring of 1884, at 
which time, because of the largely increasing population in the Kootenay dis- 
trict, owing to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railroad and the 
necessarily increased resix&gt;nsibilities attached to the office of gold commis- 
sioner and stipendiary magistrate, etc., in that region, Mr. Vowell was or- 
dered to take charge there, where, for about five years, or until 1889, he 
capably discharged his important duties. He then resigned his position in 
the provincial government service and accepted the appointment of super- 
intendent of Indian affairs for the province of British Columbia. As an 
instance of some of the special duties which Mr. Vowell was called upon 
to perform during his term of office it may be mentioned that in the early 
history of the city of Vancouver, 1887, there were serious riots there, a 
numbei- of rough characters having congregated in that city from the Amer- 
ican side and made raids on the Chinese. These incendiaries had become so 
powerful and had passed so far beyond the control of the city authorities 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 455 

that the provincial legislature, then in session, to provide for the suppression 
of the law-breaking element passed a special act relating to the preservation 
of the peace in that city, and appointed Mr. Vowell to go tO' Vancouver, 
take control, establish and maintain law and order. He made his prep- 
arations, and with the provincial inspector of police and forty sworn con- 
stables proceeded to Vancouver, where he took charge of the municipal gov- 
ernment of the city, soon restoring order and quiet where before crime was 
threatened and disorder prevailed, resulting in outrages leading up to what 
might have been very serious results. As superintendent of Indian affairs 
in the province Mr. Vowell has proved himself to be the right man in the 
right place. There are fifty Indian schools in the superintendency, consist- 
ing of industrial, boarding and day schools, besides which there are nine 
Indian agencies and twenty-five thousand Indians under his supervision. 
Every year are sent to the department at Ottawa reports showing the prog- 
ress made in behalf of the natives of the province. 

Fraternally Mr. Vowell is a Royal Arch Mason, and he also belongs 
to the pioneer society of the province, while religiously he holds to the faith 
of his ancestors. Understanding the conditions of the country and desirous 
of its best good, Mr. Vowell has proved a most capable public officer and 
made a most creditable record. 

JAMES HILL LAWSON. 

James Hill Lawson, whose business career has been one of steady devel- 
opment and progression and who today as vice-president of the R. P. Rithet 
Company, Limited, is a factor in the control of the largest wholesale grocery 
and provision establishment of the province, was born in Dundee, Scotland, 
on the 15th of December, 1840, and is of Scotch lineage. After acquiring 
a good practical education in the land of his birth, he became an accountant, 
being thus employed until, attracted by the discovery of gold in British Co- 
lumbia, and the possibilities for business advancement along other lines, he 
came to the province, sailing from Liverpool to New York, thence to the 
Isthmus of Panama and after crossing that narrow neck of land again em- 
barked, with San Francisco as his objective point on that voyage. He was 
accompanied by his brother, William Lawson, who became interested in the 
Bank of British North America, with which he has since been associated, 
and now is its manager in New York City. 

James H. Lawson entered the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company in 
a clerical capacity in 1865 and remained with that corporation until 1891, 
winning successive pix»motion as his ability found ready recognition and as 



456 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

he proved his efficiency in actual service. In the year mentioned he resigned 
his position with the Hudson's Bay Company and joined the R. P. Rithet 
Company, Limited, becoming a stockholder in the corporation. He was 
recently elected the vice-president which position he still occupies. The 
house controls a very large trade, this being the leading wholesale grocery 
house of the province. For thirteen years Mr. Lawson has been active in 
its management and control, his business ability proving a valued factor in 
the successful control of the business. 

In 1870 Mr. Lawson was married to Miss Jennet Macdonald, who was 
born in England but is of Scotch descent. While with the Hudson's Bay 
Company Mr. Lawson made his home for three years in Winnipeg, and 
one of their seven children was born there, while the others are natives of 
Victoria. The eldest son, W. A. Lawson, has charge of the insurance depart- 
ment of the R. P. Rithet Company, Limited. The daughter, Edith M., is 
at home. James H. and H. G. are both members of the law firm of Bod- 
well &amp; Lawson, attorneys of Victoria. John M. is also in the employment 
of the firm. The two youngest, Jennet Louisa and Victor Middleton, are 
attending school. Mr. Lawson and his family adhere to the faith of the 
Presbyterian church. 

Mr. Lawson is pre-eminently a business man, has always been actuated 
by the highest honor in all of his business relations, and his course has been 
in strict conformity to a high standard of commercial ethics. He and his 
family have one of the beautiful homes of Victoria. He enjoys the confi- 
dence and high esteem of his fellow townsmen, among whom he has lived 
for forty-two years, known as an active business man and reliable citizen. 

JOHN ROBERT BROWN. 

John Robert Brown, lawyer and member of parliament from the Green- 
wood riding, was born in Sarnia township, Lambton county, Ontario, on 
the 19th of February, 1862, his parents being Thomas W. and Mary (Mc- 
Gregor) Brown. The father was born in Ireland in the state of Lord Duf- 
ferin, and now resides in Sarnia township, Lambton county, Ontario, but 
the mother has departed this life. 

Mr. Brown, whose name introduces this record, attended the public 
schools and afterward the high school of his native township and entered 
upon the study of law, becoming a student in the office of Judge Lister of 
the town of Sarnia, and remained his preceptor for four years. Later he 
spent two years as a student in Osgood Hall of Toronto and in 1896 he was 
admitted to the bar and entered upon practice in Sarnia. There he remained 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 467 

until 1898, when he came to British Columbia, settling first in Rossland, 
where he practiced for six months with the firm of McNeill &amp; Deacon. He 
was admitted to the bar of British Columbia in April, 1899, and has since 
lived at Greenwood. While he was well grounded in the principles of com- 
mon law when admitted to the bar he has continued throughout the whole 
of his professional career a diligent student. He always prepares his cases 
with great care. If there is a close logical point involved in the issue it is 
his habit to thoroughly examine every authority within his reach bearing 
upon the question before the court and this makes him a most dangerous 
adversary. 

Mr. Brown was married November 18, 1903, to Miss Florence M. 
Whitmarsh, a daughter of James Whitmarsh. of Sarnia. He and his wife 
hold membership in the Methodist church and he belongs to the Independent 
Order of Foresters and the Knights of the Maccabees. He is also' a member 
of the British Columbia Law Society. Influential in political affairs he was 
elected a member of parliament for the Greenwood riding in 1903 and is 
now acting in that capacity. 

EDWARD QUENNELL. 

Edward Quennell, as a citizen of Nanaimo for some forty years has 
played a conspicuous part in business, industrial and civic affairs, and is 
universally esteemed as one of the foremost men of the city. A long and 
varied career has been his lot. Beginning when he was a lad hardly emerged 
into his teens, he has kept up a persistent activity in numerous enterprises 
until the present time, and during his lifetime he has journeyed to various 
parts of the globe, has endured and enjoyed life both as a seaman and as a 
landsman, and through adversity and prosperity alike he has retained an un- 
ruffled courage and high purpose, from which have resulted the comfortable 
circumstances and the esteem of fellows which he at present enjoys. 

Born December 16, 1846, in Sussex, England, where his parents, Wal- 
ter and Catherine (Crocker) Quennell, were thrifty farming people, he was 
privileged during his tenderest years to attend the schools of Sussex, but 
spent most of his time from the age of ten at work on the farm. He longed 
for a seafaring life, and, getting his first experience when about fourteen 
years old, he was with the British navy four years altogether. In Septem- 
ber, 1864, being then eighteen years of age, he arrived in Nanaimo, and this 
place has ever since been the central point of his residence and business. For 
the first two years he worked in the coal mines, and during the seven years 
following was mate and purser on the vessel Sir James Douglas, which was 



458 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

engaged in the coasting trade. In 1873 he started a butcher business, and 
this has continued as the principal Hne of his business activity with the ex- 
ception of a period of three years, during which he devoted himself exclu- 
sively to ranching, and he still owns his ranch property. His further busi- 
ness connections are as president of the Union brewery and as president 
of the Nanaimo Fisheries Company. 
• Mr. Quennell has been a prominent factor also in the ofificial and pub- 
lic life of his city and district. He served as mayor of Nanaimo for two 
terms, and for fifteen years was an alderman. His interest in education is 
shown by the fact that he is at this writing chairman of the school board and 
has served as a member of the board for twenty-five years. He was incum- 
bent of the positions of pilot commissioner and of harbor master for eigh- 
teen years. 

Mr. Quennell was first married in 1870, to Miss Julie S. Wilcox, by 
whom he had tliree children: Catherine, deceased, married and had one 
■ child. Edward James married Mary Ann Wearing. Annie Jane is the wife 
of Malcolm McCrea, of Nanaimo, and they have two children. In 1875 Mr. 
Quennell was married to Miss Maria Biggs, a daughter of John Biggs of 
Nanaimo. There were ten children by this marriage, as follows : Mary 
Elizabeth, the wife of Andrew J. Smith, of Nanaimo, by whom she has four 
children; Eliza; Margaret, who is the wife of J. C. Thomson, of Nanaimo, 
and has two children; Louisa, deceased; and William, Agnes, Nora, John, 
Edith and Charles. Mr, Quennell affiliates with Black Diamond Lodge, I. 
O. O. F., at Nanaimo, and in politics is a Conservative, and is a member of 
the Church of England. 

JOHN ALBERT STONE. 

John Albert Stone is well known in Revelstoke and vicinity principally 
for the reason that he is proprietor of the Oriental hotel. It is a recognized 
fact that a town's best advertisement is a first-class, well conducted public 
house. In truth the reputation of a town depends more upon the character 
of its hostelries than upon any other institutions, and no other advantages 
can quite compensate for a poor hotel. For this reason Revelstoke owes a 
constant debt of gratitude to Mr. Stone on account of the high-class estab- 
lishment which has been under his care and management for so many years. 
He went into the hotel business when almost a boy, and, being acquainted 
with all its details, he has devoted almost twenty years of his life tO' con- 
serving the comfort and welfare of the great host of people who pass much 
of their lives in public homes. Mr. Stone's present hotel, the Oriental, 




-\

was erected in 1898, and is a modern establishment, thoroughly furnished 
and equipped for the business, and is a credit to the town. It has a fifty- 
foot front, and is two stories high and has twenty bedrooms. 

The popular host of the Oriental is a native of Sweden, where he was 
born June 24. 1868, being a son of John and Annie Louise (Swanson) 
Stone. His father died at Revelstoke, April 22, 1896, but his mother is 
still living and a resident of Revelstoke. Passing the first eleven years of 
his life in Sweden, where he attended the public schools, Mr. Stone came 
with the family to America in 1879. For some time their home was in 
Minnesota, in St. Paul for a time, and he attended school at Red Wing, 
that state. His active career began with work on the construction of the 
Canadian Pacific railway, and he followed the westerly course of this great 
trunk line until March i, 1885, at which time he had reached Revelstoke, 
and here he located and has since remained. He and his father went into 
the hotel business, which has been his principal activity during the subse- 
quent twenty years, and since his father's death he has conducted the busi- 
ness alone. He also has mining interests in this great mineral district. 

March 9, 1899, Mr. Stone married Miss Martha Olson, who was also 
born in Sweden. They have two- children, Rufus and Cecil. Mr. Stone 
has fraternal affiliations with Revelstoke Lodge No. 25, L O. O. F., being 
secretary of his lodge, and with Gold Range Lodge No. 26, Knights of 
Pythias. In politics he is a Liberal, and the family are Lutherans in re- 
ligion. 

ARCHIE MAINWARING-JOHNSON. 

Archie Mainwaring-Johnson is among the younger and more success- 
ful members of the bar of Nelson, whose earnest effort, close application and 
the exercise of his native talents have won him prestige as an able lawyer. 
He w^as born in Christ church, New Zealand, March 8, 1870, his parents 
being E. M. and Louise Helen (Da vies) Johnson, both of whom are resi- 
dents of Victoria, to which city they removed during the early boyhood of 
their son, whose name introduces this review. There he was reared to 
manhood, his early educational privileges being supplemented by a course 
in the collegiate institute and by private study under the direction of Rev. 
Percival Jenns, of Victoria. He then went to Bath College in Bath, Eng- 
land, continued his studies at Somerset and later matriculated in Trinity 
Hall, Cambridge. He studied law with the firm of Drake, Jackson &amp; Helmc- 
ken, of Victoria, and also with J. H. Bowes, a barrister of Nelson, and 
in February, 1895, was admitted to the bar, after which he opened an office 



460 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

in the practice of law in Nelson. He was at first a partner with W. A. 
Macdonald, of Nelson, but this relationship was discontinued on the ist of 
August, 1904, and Mr. Johnson is now practicing alone. He has secured a 
good clientage and has intimate knowledge of the principles of jurispru- 
dence. He has legal ability of a high order, prepares his cases with great 
thoroughness and care and in his arguments is logical and convincing. 

In December, 1901, Mr. Johnson wedded Miss Mary Matilda Fraser 
McKeen, a daughter of the late I. B. McKeen, of 5trathcona. They have 
an attractive home in Nelson, where hospitality reigns supreme and they 
enjoy the favorable regard of a wide circle of acquaintances. In his pro- 
fessional relations Mr. Johnson is connected with the Kootenay Bar Asso- 
ciation and the British Columbia Bar Association. 

FRED A. STARKEY. 

Fred A. Starkey, who is engaged in a general wholesale produce and 
commission business and is also prominent in community affairs in Nelson, 
is a native of England, his birth having occurred in Lincolnshire. His 
parents, Thomas and Elizabeth (Pike) Starkey, also natives of that 
country, have now passed away. The son attended grammar schools 
in Lincolnshire and in Yorkshire, thus preparing for life's practical 
and responsible duties and after putting aside his text books he entered mer- 
cantile life, being employed in different parts of England. The opportun- 
ities of the new world, however, attracted him, and desirous of benefiting 
his financial condition he emigrated to Winnipeg in 1882. He was there 
engaged in farming for a short time and afterward turned his attention to 
the hotel business, conducting a popular hostelry there until he sold his prop- 
erty in Winnipeg and came to Nelson, arriving in this city in 1897. Here 
he accepted a position with the Parsons Produce Company, with which he 
remained until 1900, when he embarked in business on his own account under 
the firm style of Starkey &amp; Company. He transacts a general wholesale, 
produce and commission business and his trade has reached extensive pro- 
portions, his annual sales being represented by a large figure. His capa- 
bility as a business man, his executive force and keen discernment have been 
fully tested and proven in business relations in this city. He is now the 
president of the Wholesaler's Association, which was formed several years 
ago, but never accomplished much until the reorganization in 1903, when Mr. 
Starkey was elected president. Since that time great results have been ac- 
complished in the bettering of trade conditions, in securing more favorable 
freight rates and in promoting general facilities having direct bearing upon 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 461 

commercial conditions of the northwest. Mr. Starkey has been the mov- 
ing spirit in the organization and certainly deserves great credit for what 
has been accomplished, his effort being of marked value in trade circles. At 
the annual election of the Nelson board of trade in 1904 he was chosen vice- 
president and he was also the president of the Conservative Association of 
Nelson, 1902- 1904. 

In 1889 occurred the marriage of Mr. Starkey and Miss Matilda King, 
a resident of England, and their home has been blessed with one daughter, 
Fredericka Alexander. Fraternally Mr. Starkey is a Mason, holding mem- 
bership in Oakland Lodge No. 9, A. F. &amp; A. M., of Manitoba. He is also 
a member of the Sons of England and is a past district deputy of the Fra- 
ternal Order of Eagles. He has served as license commissioner of Nelson 
for two years and his interest in community affairs has been manifest in 
a tangible way in his active co-operation with many progressive measures. 
His career has been one of activity, full of incidents and results. In every 
sphere of life in which he has been called upon to move he has made an indel- 
ible impression and by his excellent public service and upright life he has 
honored the locality which has honored him with official and business prefer- 
ment. 

GEORGE NUNN. 

George Nunn, manager for the A. Macdonald Company of Winnipeg 
at their branch house in Nelson, was born in county Durham, England, on 
the 6th of June, 1876, his parents being Harry and Hannah Nunn. He 
was but nine years of age when he crossed the Atlantic to America, becom- 
ing a resident of Winnipeg. He continued his education in the public schools 
there until 1888, when he entered upon his business career as an employe of 
J. H. Rose, a druggist, with whom he continued until 1889. In the latter 
year he became connected with the A. Macdonald Company of Winnipeg and 
gradually worked his way upward, finding in each transition stage oppor- 
tunity for still further advancement. He has now been with the firm for 
fifteen years and is one of its trusted employes, his capability and fidelity 
winning him consecutive promotion. In May, 1897, he was transferred to 
the branch house at Nelson to act as bookkeeper and in February, 1903, 
he was promoted to the position of manager, in which capacity he is now 
capably serving, the business proving a profitable investment under his care- 
ful direction. He is a well known factor in business circles here, has taken 
an active interest in the board of trade and in the Nelson Wholesalers 
Association. 



462 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

In July, 1898, Mr. Niinn was married to Miss May Aitken, of Winni- 
peg, and they have one child, Doris Aitken. Mr. Nunn belongs to the Can- 
adian Order of Foresters and Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and to 
the Methodist church. He has always taken a keen interest in athletic sports, 
winning the championship in Manitoba for sprinting in 1896. He was also 
at one time one of the Nelson hose reel team champions of Kootenay. He 
enjoys the esteem of a large circle of friends, and possessing the enterprising 
spirit of the northwest is contributing to the general prosperity of Nelson 
as well as to his individual success in business affairs. 

SENATOR JAMES REID. 

Senator James Reid, who attained wealth and honors through a life 
of intense and well directed activity, his work proving not alone of benefit 
to himself, but also of value to his district, was born at Cascades, Quebec, 
in 1840, and died on the 3d of May, 1904. His parents, James and Anna 
(Maxwell) Reid, were natives of Ireland, and crossing the Atlantic to 
America established their home near Quebec, being early settlers of that part 
of the country. The father devoted his attention to agricultural pursuits, 
and James Reid was reared upon the home farm, early becoming familiar 
with the duties and labors that fall to the lot of the agriculturist. He was 
granted liberal educational privileges, attending the public and high schools 
near his home and completing his literary course in the college at Ottawa. 
When sixteen years of age he entered upon his business career as an employe 
in the meixantile store of James McClaren, now of British Columbia, with 
whom he continued until 1862, when attracted by the Cariboo gold excite- 
ment he came to the Pacific coast, making the voyage by way of the Isthmus 
of Panama. He went direct to Williams creek, where he spent seven years 
in mining. During his early experience in British Columbia he made no 
less than five trips into the Cariboo district, carrying his pack upon his back. 
This meant traveling thousands of miles, for at the close of each season 
in the mining district when the snows made further work impossible he 
would return to Victoria, where his winters were devoted to whatever work 
he could get to do. After spending five years at mining he found himself 
just as ix)or as when he started upon the search for the precious metal, and 
arriving at the conclusion that he could not make a fortune in the mines 
he wisely determined to concentrate his efforts upon other lines of business. 
He therefore started anew at Quesnel, where he gradually worked his way 
upward, attaining financial success and also political honors. 

It was in 1869 that Mr. Reid joined a Mr. Foster at Lillooet in a 





/.IN ,' ;, ^ I 



■■, i&lt; ,v 1 i: 11 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 4:63 

general mercantile venture. Not long afterward he entered the employ of 
the Barnard Express company at Barkerville in the Cariboo district, and 
subsequently he went to Quesnel, where he settled in 1870. He removed 
to that place as the representative of the express company, but gradually con- 
centrated his efforts more and more largely upon the mercantile business, 
which grew to extensive proportions and is now a part of the estate which 
he left to his family and which is managed by his widow. He found it 
necessary to increase his stock to meet the growing demands of his trade, 
for a liberal patronage was accorded him in recognition of honorable meth- 
ods and his earnest desire to please his customers. Notably prompt, ener- 
getic and reliable, he never made an engagement that he did not meet, nor 
incur an obligation that he did not fulfill, and his business record is such 
as any man might be proud to possess. It gained him the respect and con- 
fidence of his associates in commercial circles and of the general public, and 
as the years passed his efforts found their legitimate reward in a handsome 
competence. His force of character, ability and devotion to the public good 
also won the attention and recognition of those among whom' he lived, and 
in 1882 he was honored by election to the house of commons as a supporter 
of the Conservative party, and in 1884, at the general election, he was re- 
turned by acclamation. In 1888 he was again chosen for the position over 
two opponents, and in 1889 he was appointed to the senate by Sir John A. 
Macdonald, where he served continuously up to the time of his death, cov- 
ering a period of fifteen consecutive years. He made a close study of the 
social, economic and ix)litical questions affecting the welfare of the country, 
and his influence was unfalteringly given to every measure which he believed 
would prove of benefit to the province. A man of firm convictions, he stood 
fearlessly in defense of what he believed to be right, and left the impress of 
his individuality upon much of the legislation, the wisdom and worth of 
which time has proven. 

In 1883 Mr. Reid was united in marriage to Miss Charlotte Clark, a 
daughter of Nicholas and Frances (Mills) Clark, both of whom were na- 
tives of Ireland, whence they made their way to Ontario, Canada, being 
among the early pioneers there. Unto Senator and Mrs. Reid two sons 
were born : James Maxwell and Clark Sanson, both attending school. 

In an analyzation of the life record of Mr. Reid it will be noted that he 
was most persevering and energetic, which qualities alone assured the great 
success he achieved in mercantile pursuits. He was also well known for 
his liberality and for his devotion to his family and friends. The ix)or and 
needy found in him a helper, for remembering the struggles of his earlier 



464 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

years he was always willing to assist others who manifested a disposition 
to help themselves. He never believed in the indiscriminate giving that 
fosters vagrancy and idleness, but was always generous in his gifts to benev- 
olent institutions, or wherever he believed that his aid was merited. He 
held friendship inviolable and his interests centered in his home. He re- 
garded no personal sacrifice on his part too great, if it would promote .the 
welfare or enhance the happiness of his wife and children. He was a strong 
advocate of temperance in its underlying principles and was in the truest 
sense a self-made man, hecoming during the long years of his residence in 
British Columbia one of its best known citizens and honored representa- 
tives. Mrs. Reid, a lady of refinement and culture, presiding with gracious- 
ness over a hospitable home, now resides in the popular west end district 
of Vancouver, where she has a wide circle of friends. The life record of 
Senator Reid should serv-e as a source of inspiration and encouragement to 
others. While he accomplished much in the business world and ratified his 
friendships by kindly sympathy and thoughtful consideration his greatest 
depth of love was reserved for his family. 

HARRY BH^D. 

During five years' residence in Nelson Harry Bird has made for him- 
self a leading position in the front ranks of the business men of this por- 
tion of British Columbia. He is engaged in dealing in real estate, is also 
conducting an insurance business and is interested in mining properties. He 
has represented the West Ward in the City Council for the past two years 
as alderman. He has marked perseverance, reliability, energy and incon- 
querable determination — qualities which enable him to pursue a course that 
has been marked out and it is these salient elements in his character that 
have made him one of the substantial and valued citizens of the province. 

Mr. Bird was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England, on the 
8th of September, 1857, his parents being Charles and Emily (Webster) 
Bird, both of whom are deceased. His education was acquired in Clifton 
College, where he pursued a full course. He afterward signed articles with 
Thomas J. Bewick of the firm of Bewick &amp; Moreing, mining engineers of 
London, England, with whom he continued for four years, subsequent to 
which time he took charge of the Argentiere mines of France in the capacity 
of manager. He continued there for a year and later became consulting 
engineer for Sir Francis Bolton, of London, England. He acted in that 
capacity for six years and during that time twice visited Mexico on trips 
of inspection. Sir Francis Bolton also had mines in France, Germany and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA ' 465 

Algeria in addition to iron stone mines on the estate of the Duke of Marl- 
borough at Blenheim. In the year 1887 Mr. Bird crossed the Atlantic to 
Canada and located in the Moose mountain district, two hundred miles west 
of Winnipeg. He joined his brother there, built a flourmill and estab- 
lished a trading post for trade with the Indians. He became the founder of 
the village of Connington Manor and was actively identified with the devel- 
opment of that place as a proprietor until 1899. when he left his interests 
in the charge of his partner and came to Nelson, British Columbia. Here 
he opened a real estate and insurance office and in connection with business 
along these lines he is likewise handling mining property and placing invest- 
ments in mining interests. The firm handles the lands of the Canadian 
Pacific Railroad Company from the divide on the east to the divide on the 
west about seventy-five miles square. They also have town sites in Nelson, 
Castlegar and Proctor. Mr. Bird has thoroughly acquainted himself with 
realty values in this section of the country, recognized opportunity for judi- 
cious investment and profitable sale and in the conduct of his business has 
secured a large clientage, negotiating many important realty transfers which 
adds not alone to his success as a business man but also proves a factor in the 
general prosperity of this section of the province. 

In 1884 Mr. Bird was married to Miss Eliza Belton, a daughter of 
James H. Belton, manager of Munster Bank in Cork, Ireland. He is a 
Mason in his fraternal relations, belonging to Moosomin lodge, of the North- 
west territory. He is also an associate member of the institution of civil 
engineers and his religious faith is indicated by his relationship with the 
Church of England. In his business career he has made consecutive advance- 
ment and today stands as one of the leading representatives of his chosen 
field of activity. Drawing the lessons which we do from his life work we 
learn that the qualifications necessary for success are a high ambition and a 
resolute, honorable purpose to reach the. exalted standard that has been set up. 

WILLIAM KIRKWOOD LEIGHTON. 

William Kirkwood Leighton has been closely identified with the busi- 
ness interests of Nanaimo for twenty years. He has spent practically all 
his life in British Columbia, and belongs to the class of public-spirited and 
enterprising citizens to whom the most credit for material and commercial 
progress is due. He has grown up with the country, started out on his 
career without capital or special advantages, and has advanced steadily into 
business prominence and the esteem of his fellow citizens. 

Mr. Leighton was born in Benicia, California, November 21, 1854, a 



466 • BRITISH COLUMBIA 

son of David and Isabel (Buie) Leighton, who are both deceased. His 
parents brought him to British Columbia when he was a child, so that his 
life's associations are almost entirely with this province. He was educated 
in the public schools of Victoria through the high school, and after that 
learned the art of telegraphy. For six years he was in the employ of the 
Dominion government as a telegrapher. He then went to clerking and book- 
keeping, being employed in Victoria, Nanaimo and other places in the upper 
country. He located permanently in Nanaimo in 1882, and for the first 
six years kept the books of the firm of A. R. Johnson and Company. After 
that he embarked in business on his own account, establishing a real estate, 
insurance and mining business which he has continued with increasing suc- 
cess to the present time. He represents the staple life and fire insurance 
companies, among them the Confederation Life Insurance Company and 
eight English fire insurance companies. 

In 1884 Mr. Leighton married Miss Hattie Gough, a daughter of Ed- 
win Gough, of Nanaimo. Their pleasant home contains five bright chil- 
dren: Frederick K., Gladys S., Clifford M., Russell L. and William K., Jr. 
Mr. Leighton affiliates with Ashlar Lodge No. 3, A. F. &amp; A. M., with Van- 
couver Commandery of the Knights Templar, and is a Shriner, belonging 
to Victoria Temple. He is also a member of the Woodmen of the World 
and of the Fraternal Order of Eagles. In politics a Conservative, he is sec- 
retary of the Conservative Association. He has served as a school trustee 
one term, and all public matters are an object of interest and effort on his 
part. He and the family are adherents of the Presbyterian church. 

W. J. BLAKE WILSON. 

W. J. Blake Wilson, well known citizen and business man of Nelson. 
British Columbia, has been prosecuting a busy and successful career in this 
part of the country for a number of years, ever since leaving the old home 
farm in Ontario, and he has made himself a most useful and highly esteemed 
■citizen. He is a man of many resources, has energy sufficient for carrying 
out the plans of a resolute mind, and has been found a dependable and active 
factor in the business circles of this portion of the province. 

Born in Wellington, Simcoe county, Ontario, April 29, 1866, a son of 
John and Catherine (Manning) Wilson, both deceased, Mr. Wilson had the 
rearing of a farm boy, attended public school at Bradford, then for two terms 
enjoyed the advantages of the Arcade Commercial College in Toronto, after 
that worked hard on his father's farm until he was twenty-three years old, 
and in 1890, ambitious, strong and resolute, he came out to Kamloops, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 467 

British Columbia. Going down the Columbia river, he secured the beef 
contract for the Canadian Pacific Railway from Nelson to Robson. This 
meat contracting business he carried on in the Kootenay country for three 
years, and in 1893 associated himself with the P. Burns and Company. He 
is still a member of the firm and has had charge of the meat contracting 
division of their business since it was inaugurated. In addition to contract- 
ing he also ran a pack train in the Columbia river district from 1890 to 
1892, and for two years carried the mail from Colville, Washington, so that 
he has indeed had a varied and eventful career, and while he has been keenly 
alive tO' his own interests he has at the same time been a worthy factor in 
the general development of this part of the coimtry. He is recognized as an 
eminently public-spirited citizen, and the city of Nelson is fortunate in 
counting him among its citizenship. 

Mr. Wilson affiliates with Nelson Lodge No. 23, A. F. &amp; A. M. He 
was married in 1890 to Miss M. L. Ferguson, of Ontario. His wife is now 
the pioneer woman of Nelson, having been among the first arrivals on the 
city's site. They have two children. Joe and Blake, and the older is now 
attending St. Andrew's College in Toronto. 

THOMAS EMBLETON. 

■ Thomas Embleton is the proprietor of the best grocery of Rossland and 
has developed a business from small proportions through the exercise of his 
native talent, unfaltering diligence and keen business discernment. He was 
born near Sunderland, county Durham, England, February 15, 1867. His 
father, William Embleton, is now^ residing near that place, but his mother, 
who bore the maden name of Mary Ann Atkinson,, has departed this life. 
Following the completion of his education accjuired in the common schools, 
Thomas Embleton began farming and was thus engaged for five years in the 
north of England, after which he went to the coal mines, where he worked 
until the 6th of July, 1893. He then came to British Columbia, locating at 
Nanaimo', and for two and a half years worked in the mines there. He after- 
ward removed to Three Forks, British Columbia, where he remained for a 
short time and again engaged in mining. He afterw-ard went to Montana, 
being employed in the m.ines for four months, and in February, 1896, he 
arrived in Rossland. Here he was employed for a half year in the Leroy 
mine and for four months in the Iron Colt mine, when seeing new advantages 
opening for a mercantile enterprise he established a grocery store, having at 
first but a limited stock of goods. He afterward changed his location and 
subsequently was forced to move again during the great fire. He came to 



468 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

his present place of business in August, 1903, and is today proprietor of the 
finest grocery and store in the city, having a large and well selected stock, 
which is neatly and tastefully arranged so that the attractive appearance of 
the store is in a degree responsible for its large patronage. Mr. Embleton 
is also well known as a most reliable business man and his earnest desire 
to please his customers has secured to him a gratifying patronage. As the 
years have advanced and his financial resources have increased he has not con- 
fined his attention entirely to merchandising, but has become largely inter- 
ested in mining and is a member of the Trout Lake syndicate and of the Cali- 
fornia syndicate. 

IHi 1886 Mr. Embleton was united in marriage to Miss Annie Leadbit- 
ter, a daughter of John Leadbitter, of Durham county, England. He is 
quite prominent in fraternal circles, being grand treasurer of the grand lodge, 
of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, high priest of the grand encamp- 
ment of Odd P^ellows of British Columbia, also a member of the Order of 
Rebekah, the Knights of Pythias fraternity, and the Rathbone Sisters. He 
belongs to and is a supporter of the Methodist church, and is deeply in- 
terested in the moral development of the community. In politics he is a 
Liberal and he served as alderman in 1902 and 1903. Such in brief is the 
life history of Mr. Embleton. In whatever relation of life we find him — 
in the government service, in political circles, in business or in social rela- 
tions — he is always the same honorable and honored gentleman, whose worth 
well merits the high regard which is uniformly given him. 

MOSES LENZ. 

Moses Lenz, senior member of the well known wholesale drygoods firm 
of Lenz and Leiser at Victoria, has devoted all the years of his life since 
early boyhood to dry-goods merchandising. Ele is a capable, alert and pro- 
gressive business man, and has made a large success simply because he has 
deserved it. He showed his business instincts in early life, and great energy 
and perseverance have accomplished the rest. It is a pleasure to state that 
the firm of Lenz and Lesier is the most extensive of its kind in all the province 
of British Columbia, and its growth and management are the net results of 
the character and ability of its proprietors. 

Mr. Lenz was born in Madison, Wisconsin, February 17, 1862. He is 
of German stock, and his father, Jacob Lenz, was born in Germany and emi- 
grated to Madison, ^Visconsin, in 1854, where h6 was engaged in merchan- 
dising until his death. The son Moses v^as educated in his native city, but 
had not advanced far from childhood when he entered into the serious occu- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 469 

patioii of life. He has been identified with the dry-goods business contin- 
uously since he was fourteen years old. He came out to Victoria in 1873 
and for the following three years sold dry-goods in the store of A. B. Gray, 
and then for a short time was connected with the White House store. In 
1880 he and Mr. J. York founded the present business, it was incorporated 
in 1892, and has always had a steady and substantial growth. They may 
be said to have begun business in a shack fifteen by forty feet in dimensions, 
and the present quarters alone would indicate how large has been their 
growth. The fine brick block of Lenz and Leiser is sixty by eighty feet, and 
three stories high. They also have a large brick manufactory in which are 
made men's overalls, shirts and similar goods. In this department employ- 
ment is given to thirty young women. Three salesmen are kept on the 
road from one year to another in order to dispose of their manufactures, 
and the goods bearing their brands are sold all over the northwest. Liberal 
and honorable business methods have been large factors in their success, 
and they now have the reputation of possessing the largest wholesale dry- 
goods house in British Columbia. Mr. Lenz sfives strict attention to all the 
details of his enterprise and is always to be found working for its extension 
and upbuilding. Each year he makes a trip to Dawson on the Yukon in the 
interests of the firm, and he personally sells a large amount of goods. 

Mr. Lenz affiliates with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. • For 
a number of years he has been an active member of the board of trade and 
in that capacity as in other ways has done much for the welfare of his cit}-. 
In 189 1 he was happily married to Miss Hattie Cohen, who is a native 
daughter of California. They have one daughter, Helen. They are mem- 
bers of the Hebrew synagogue, and are held in the highest esteem by a large 
circle of friends. 

DR. LEWIS THOMAS DAVIS. 

Dr. Lewis Thomas Davis, a long established physician and surgeon at 
Nanaimo, has made an enviable record in his profession through his skill, 
his native ability and the high attainments which he has brought to his life 
work. He has a wide reputation among hundreds of private households in 
Nanaimo and vicinity, but also has the responsibility of several official con- 
nections, and is a practitioner of recognized high rank throughout his 
district. 

Dr. Davis was born in Portland, state of Maine, July 4, 1862, being 
a son of William and Jane (Coates) Davis, who are both now deceased. Edu- 
cated in the excellent Trinity College at Fort Hope, he then took up studies 



470 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

preparatory to his profession as a matriculate of Queen's University at King- 
ston, Ontario, where he was graduated with the class of 1883, as a Doctor of 
Medicine. He then left Canada and went to San Francisco, where he was 
located six months with a brother, A. C. Davis. He was then induced to 
take charge of a hospital at Belmont, Nevada, but as he found affairs there 
to have been misrepresented to him he stayed only one week. Returning 
to California he engaged in practice at Redwood City for three months, 
and on May 2, 1884, he arrived in Nanaimo, which has since proved to 
be his permanent location and where he has worked out his professional 
career to its fullest capacity. His first purpose in coming to this city was 
to act as. temporary assistant for the late Dr. Cluness, colliery physician to 
the Vancouver Coal Company. After two years he dissolved partnership and 
has since carried on an extensive and profitable practice alone. For the 
past eighteen years he has been surgeon to Nanaimo Hospital, and for five 
years has served the district as coroner. He is examining physician for 
several life insurance companies, and for the last eighteen years has been 
surgeon to the provincial jail. For four years he served as a member for 
the Nanaimo district on the provincial board of health. Professionally he 
fraternizes with the British Columbia Medical Association. 

Dr. Davis was married in July, 1887, to Miss Eva May Reynard, a 
daughter of the late Rev. Reynard, Episcopal minister at Nanaimo. Their 
five children are Gerald, Phyllis, Flwyn, Travers and Cedric. Dr. Davis 
and his family are Episcopalians. 

WILLIAM OLIVER ROSE, M. D. 

Dr. William Oliver Rose, physician and surgeon at Nelson, also prom- 
inent in public affairs and the fraternal orders, has passed his entire pro- 
fessional career in this city, and has been unqualifiedly successful. A young 
man, of great energy, determined purpose, excellent native ability combined 
with' thorough professional equipment obtained in one of the foremost med- 
ical schools on the American continent, he has already reached a recognized 
high place in medical circles and is of the type of citizenship most valuable 
to a growing, flourishing country like British Columbia. 

Born on Prince Edward Island, February 10, 1871, a son of William 
and Jane (Baker) Rose, the former of whom is still living on Prince Edward 
Island, the latter deceased. Dr. Rose received his early education in the pub- 
lic schools and in Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown. Like many 
odier successful men, he began his career by teaching school, for four years 
being a teacher in his native province, and in 1891 he went to Manitoba and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 471 

taught three years in Crystal City. He then entered the famous McGill 
University, and in 1898 graduated as the Holmes medalist. His student 
course having gained him a reputation for unusual proficiency, he was ap- 
pointed medical physician of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, where 
he remained thirteen months. In 1899 he came out to British Columbia to 
take charge of the local hospital at Nelson. After serving as resident 
physician in that institution for nine months he retired to private practice, 
and has since been engaged in attending t6 a profitable and steadily increasing 
clientage. 

August 28, 1901, Dr. Rose was married to Miss Azza J. Brownell, a 
daughter of John Brownell, of Brockton, Massachusetts. Dr. and Mrs. Rose 
are members of the Baptist church, and in politics he is a Conservative. He. 
is p3 eminent in various societies and orders. He is a member of the British 
Columbia Medical Association. His popularity locally and his interest in 
home affairs are indicated in his election in 1903 to the office of mayor of 
Nelson, and as such he served one year. He is a past commander of the 
.Knights of the Maccabees; is past president of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, 
and was a delegate to the grand lodge of the order at Baltimore in 1904. 
He is chief ranger of the local lodge of the Canadian Order of Foresters, 
and he has affiliations with the Knights of Pythias. 

JOSEPH W. CAREY. 

Many years have passed and great changes have occurred since Joseph 
Westrope Carey came to British Columbia, arriving at Fort Victoria on the 
nth of May, 1858. Great portions of this country were still unexplored 
and large districts knew no inhabitants save the roving mining population, 
who were searching for gold without serious thought of becoming perma- 
nent settlers or of bearing a part in the substantial upbuilding of the country. 
Now all the improvements, conveniences and advantages known to- the older 
civilizations are here found, and Mr. Carey has in the years of his active 
labor become the possessor of property to which he still gives his supervision, 
but otherwise he is living a retired life. He has long been regarded as one 
of the prominent and helpful citizens here and in the early days he served 
as Victoria's mayor. 

Mr. Carey was born in the parish of Ahabologue, barony of West 
Musgary, county Cork, Ireland, in 1830. His parents were William 
Westrope and Honora Van Stone (Collins) Carey. The father was an of- 
ficer in the Thirty-third Regiment of Foot in the king's service and was in 
active duty in Egypt during the Napoleonic wars. Both he and his wife 



472 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

were members of the Church of England and he attained the ripe old age 
of eighty-nine years, while his wife died in her fifty-sixth year. They were 
the parents of seven children, who reached years of maturity, but Joseph 
Westrope Carey is the only one now living. 

In his native parish he was educated, and after mastering the branches 
taught in the public schools he learned land surveying. He was fifteen years 
of age, when, in 1845, he crossed the Atlantic to Boston, Massachusetts. 
He had left home in April of that year, had spent a short time in England and 
had arrived in Boston in July. There he was engaged in surveying until 
1852, when at the age of twenty-five years he went to California, where for 
eighteen months he was engaged on the survey of what is now the boundary 
line of tbe territory of Arizona. He then returned to San Francisco, where 
he was employed on a contract to make a survey on the Colorado desert, and 
did the surveying from the San Bernardino meridian to the Colorado river. 
The United States deputy government surveyor was Dr. R. C. Matthewson, 
who stcured the contract from Col. John Hayes, who was state surveyor- 
general at the time. Mr. Carey was Matthewson's surveyor and conducted- 
the field work. His next work was in Mexico, where he located a coloniza- 
tion grant of land of forty-five square leagues of land in Lower California. 
In 1858 he again returned to San Francisco and hearing of the gold discov- 
eries on the Eraser river he took passage for that place in company with 
Amur De Cosmos, Sam Kelly, Selick, Rothwell and George Perks, the last 
named afterward the first attorney-general of Vancouver Island. 

Mr. Carey went to the mines on Hill Bar and proceeded up the canyon to 
Lillooet. having a pack on his back, a shovel in one hand and a pick in the 
other, while practically all his possessions were under his prospecting pan 
on his shoulders. Mr. Carey and his party were the discoverers of Rocky 
Bar. They afterward returned from Foster's Bar and back to the forks of 
the Eraser and Thompson rivers, where they found their supply of provisions 
exhausted and were glad to pay fifty cents for a piece of horse meat, from 
the Indian chief, Spintlum, which, as Mr. Carey declared, " tasted good, 
too." At Rocky Bar he met with good success, making about sixty dollars 
per day, but while there he had his hand crushed, and this occasioned his 
return to Yale, where he remained until the spring of 1859. He then went 
to Simmihamoo Bay, near Point Roberts, and was there engaged by Com- 
missioner Campbell on the boundary survey, taking reconnaisance of the 
roads and making a map showing the topography and the distance and also 
marking the locations where wood and water were to be found. The com- 
mission on which he was employed proceeding later to the Columbia, he 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 473 

discovered the Similkameen mines. In his travels he gained a broad and 
accurate knowledge of the country and its resources, and few citizens have 
more intimate knowledge concerning the early history of the province. 

On the i6th of November, i860, Mr. Carey returned to Victoria and 
located on Kane street, where he built a residence" with lumber which was 
brought from Mendocino county, California, and cost fifty dollars a thousand 
feet, while the windows and doors were made in London, England. In that 
house he resided for thirty-seven years. For a time he was employed in the 
store owned by the Hudson's Bay Company and later he went to the Leech 
river mines. Then in 1870 he purchased land in Colquetz valley. It is now 
located on what is known as the Carey road, named in his honor. He im- 
proved that property, placing ninety-five acres under cultivation. He planted 
six hundred fruit trees and raised cattle and hogs, having as many as one 
hundred and twenty-five hogs at a time. He carried on general farming 
with good success and his son, Joseph William, is now operating the farm. 
In 1874 he made arrangements to survey for the government four and half 
townships, back of Ladner and extending to the boundary line and to Lang- 
ley. This survey he completed and also surveyed on the islands in the gulf 
of Georgia. On the completion of that work he returned to his farm and 
entered upon its improvement, erecting its present excellent buildings, plac- 
ing the land under a high state of cultivation and developing a valuable 
property. He also invested from time to time in real estate, has erected 
houses and brick store buildings in Victoria and is now the owner of much 
valuable property, which has been a factor in the improvement of the city, 
while at the same time contributing to his individual success. 

In the municipal government and active control of the city he has also 
been deeply interested and in 1865 he was elected a member of the city 
council, serving under Mayor Thomas Harris. He was again elected to that 
office in 1869, 1870 and 1871, and in 1884 he had the honor of being elected 
mayor of the city. All of these offices were at that time without salary and 
were occupied by men who were unselfishly devoted to the interests of the 
city and her upbuilding. He faltered in the performance of no duty and put 
forth strenuous effort for the city's welfare. On retiring from office he 
gave his undivided attention to his business affairs, but has never ceased to 
be a public-spirited citizen, interested in the welfare and substantial de- 
velopment of Victoria and the province. 

In 1852, in Boston. Massachusetts, Mr. Carey was married* to Miss 
Caroline Louisa Slater, a native of Derbyshire, England, and a daughter of 
the Rev. Thomas Slater, a Methodist clergyman. He left his bride in Bos- 



474 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ton while he went tO' the Pacific coast to make his fortune and in 1859 she 
joined him in this part of the country, and was one of the well known and 
noble pioneer women, who, while taking a less conspicuous part, have taken 
a no less helpful part in the upbuilding- of the great northwest, their in- 
fluence being a power for good in the community. She died on the 19th of 
April, 1899, after a happy married life of forty-seven years. She had been 
an excellent and faithful helpmate, a devoted and loving wife and mother 
and her loss has been very deeply felt by her family and many friends. Her 
remains lie interred in Rossberry cemetery. They had two sons, born in 
Victoria, Joseph William and Herbert Clement. Mr. and Mrs. Carey gave 
careful attention to the early education and training of these sons and both 
displayed much talent in drawing. Many of their works Mr. Carey has 
had framed and they now adorn his home, displaying considerable ability. 
He also took them all through the problems in Euclid and the drawings of 
all these he has preserved in a drawing book in which they executed their 
tasks. The elder son is now on the farm which was developed by his father, 
while Herbert Clement is in the army as a member of the Royal Engineers 
and is now in the war office in London, England. His rank is now that of 
major. 

Mr. Carey stands today as one of the most respected and worthy pioneer 
residents of Victoria, and well merits the success which has come to him. 
He belongs to that class of representative business men who while advanc- 
ing individual success also promote the general prosperity, and his labors 
have ever been of a character that have proven most helpful in the work of 
settlement in the province. 

WALTER R. GILLEY. 

Walter R. Gilley, who for over a quarter of a century has been actively 
connected with the business and industrial affairs of British Columbia, is, 
with his brother, proprietor of a coal, wood, cement and building supplies 
business, their establishment being the leading one of the kind at New West- 
minster. 

Mr. Gilley was born October 22, 1859, at St. Andrews, New Bruns- 
wick, where were also born his parents, Walter and Sarah (Rogers) Gilley. 
His father, who for a great many years was a school teacher, came to British 
Columbia in 1887, and died in 1903 at the advanced age of eighty-four. 

Mr. ■ Gilley received his early education in the public schools of New 
Brunswick, and at the age of fifteen left school and for the following year 
and a half clerked in the postoffice at St. Stephens. In October, 1877, when 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 475 

he was just eighteen years old, he arrived in British Columbia. From his 
arrival here until only a few years ago he was prominently connected with 
the lumbering industry, and in that line he had a long and successful expe- 
rience. His first work was in the lumber woods bordering the Fraser river. 
A part of his time was spent in driving a six-yoke team of oxen, which was 
considered quite an accomplishment in the days when such means were the 
only method of getting the timiber to tidewater. After five years of logging 
Mr. Gilley went in with his brother, James R., at Port Haney, and began 
hauling sand and wood. This was continued until 1886, when they engaged 
in logging on the Fraser river; in the following year they established a livery 
and mainland transfer business at New Westminster, prosecuting that until 
1893. in 1894 they resumed the logging industry. During their operations 
they cut some of the largest timber in British Columbia, some of the trees 
measuring three hundred feet from ground to top, and one giant trunk 
which they took to tidewater was ninety feet long, fifty-eight inches in 
diameter at the small end and seven feet at the butt. In 1898, the year 
of the big fire in New Westminster, the Gilley brothers retired from the 
logging business, and began dealing in coal, wood, cement and building sup- 
plies, which has been the line of their operations to the present time. They 
supplied the crushed rock for the New Westminster bridge spanning the 
Fraser river, known as one of the finest structures of the kind in Canada, 
they having opened a quarry on Pitt river for this purpose, and they have 
continued to work it since. It has been the privilege of Mr. Gilley to witness 
many changes and improvements in this part of the country, which was com- 
paratively a wilderness when he made the beginnings of his life work here. 
Mr. Gilley married, in 1888, Miss Selina F. Hinch. She was born in 
Ontario, and her father, John Hinch, was one of the old settlers of Port 
Haney. taking up his abode there in 1875. ^^- ^"^ M.rs. Gilley have eight 
children. For two years, 1899- 1900, M^- Gilley was a city alderman, and 
during that time was chairman of the board of public works. He is an active 
member of the New Westminster board of trade, and in politics supports 
the Conser\^ative party. His fraternal associations are with the Independent 
Order of Odd Fellows, 

CHARLES H. WILSON. 

Charles H. Wilson, a member of the prominent contracting firm of Crow 

.Wilson, of Vancouver, has been a resident of this city since 1886 and is 

itified with its public interests as well as its business affairs, serving at 

is writing in 1904 as alderman. He is a native of Wingham, Ontario, 



476 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and is of Scotch lineage. His father, John Wilson, was torn in Scotland 
and in the ninth year of his age became a resident of Montreal, Canada, re- 
maining in the Dominion until his death. He married Miss Charlotte Gray, 
who w.as born of Scotch lineage and was a native of Canada. He died in 
1902 m the seventy-second year of his age, and his wife survived him for 
but a brief period, passing away in the same year. They were members of 
the Presbyterian church, strict in their religious faith, closely adhering to 
the highesi principles of honor and reliability. In their family were nine 
children. 

Chtirles H. Wilson, the only representative of the family in British 
Colombia, was educated in the schools of his native town and in early 
manhood, hearings of the prospects for the development of a great and pros- 
perous city en the Pacific coast, he decided to make his way to the northwest 
and seek a fortune in this field of business enterprise. The city had just 
been founded when he arrived here and he at once began business as a con- 
tractor and also as a real estate speculator, and in these fields, because of 
the phenon^enal growth of Vancouver and his business skill and capacity, he 
has been eminently successful. As good opportunities have occurred he has 
made judicious investments in real estate and is now the owner of much 
valuable cily property. In his business career he has brooked no obstacles 
that could be overcome by strong determination and honorable purpose and 
thus he has advanced to a position prominent in Vancouver. 

In his political views Mr. Wilson has always been a Liberal, loyal and 
public-spirited, and in 1901 he was chosen by the citizens of his ward to rep- 
resent them in the city council. He discharged the duties of the office so 
satisfactorily that he is now serving for the third term in that position 
and he exercises his official prerogatives in support of every progressive 
measure that he feels will prove of real value and benefit. On the occasion 
of his second election he had the honor of being elected by acclamation, 
which was a most satisfactory evidence of able service he has rendered. 
He is now serving in the important position of chairman of the water 
board of the city and every improvement for Vancouver has received his 
hearty endorsement, he being especially active in support of the cause of well 
paved streets and good works. He has ever been faithful in advancing 
measures for the future of Vancouver and his fellow townsmen have similar 
faith in him. He is indeed an energetic, progressive and reliable business 
man and his course at all times has been such as to merit the good will, 
esteem and confidence of those whom he has met.

J. S. LAWRENCE. 

J. S. Lawrence, superintendent of the Kootenay division of the Canadian 
Pc'icific Raih'oad at Nelson, has throughout his entire Hfe been identified with 
raih'oad work and his capabihty has led to consecutive promotion until he is 
now occupying a position of marked responsibility and importance. He 
was born in Toronto, Canada, on the 9th of April, 1863, and entered the 
railway service as telegraph operator on the old Northern and Northwestern 
Railway at Collingswood, Ontario, in December, 1879. He removed to Barrie 
in 1 88 1 and the following year was appointed relieving agent. In 1886 he 
joined the service of the Canadian Pacific Railroad Company, since which 
time his record of progress is as follows : from September, 1886, until 1887, 
he v.as train dispatcher at North Bend, British Columbia; from 1887 until 
December, 1893, was train dispatcher at Kamloops, British Columbia; from 
December, 1893, until September, 1899, ^^ ^'^'^^ train master of the Nakausp 
&amp; Slocan Railway at Nakausp, British Columbia; from September, 1899, 
until 1902, was train master on the Columbia &amp; Western Railway at Smelter 
Junction, British Columbia; and from 1902 until July, 1904, he was train 
master of the Canadian Pacific Railroad at Nelson and at the last -named date 
was appointed superintendent of the division. His close application and de- 
votion to duty have continuously promoted his efficiency and have made him 
one of the most trusted representatives of the road. 

Mr. Lawrence married Miss Emily Telfer, a resident of Collingswood, 
Ontario, and they have one child, Hall Telfer. He belongs to the Ancient 
Order of United Workmen and his religious faith is indicated by his member- 
ship in the Church of England. Thoroughly interested in the great north- 
west aid its development he takes an active part in public affairs in as far as 
his business duties will permit, and is the advocate of every progressive 
measure that tends to benefit the community or advance local or national 
progress. 

MARSHAL BRAY. 

Marshal Bray has been for nearly a quarter of a centur)^ prominently 
identified with the official life and affairs of Nanaimo, and his standing in 
the community is that of an efficient, broad-minded and public-spirited gen- 
tleman, a reputation well deserved on account of his honorable and praise- 
worthy career in the province and the sterling integrity of his character. 
He is numbered among the British Columbia pioneers, and for more than 
forty years his life has been devoted to useful and conscientious endeavor 
in this province. 



478 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

He was born in Halton county, Ontario, August 30, 1840, and his 
father, Ezra Bray, died in 1890, and his mother, Mary Ann (Dexter) Bray, 
died in 1897. Educated in the grammar schools of Oakville, Halton 
county, and working during vacation months on the home farm, he thus 
employed his early years until June, 1862, when, being a vigorous and am- 
bitious young fellow of twenty-two, he made the trip around by the Isthmus 
of Panama to Cariboo, British Columbia. For the following fourteen years 
he tried mining in all its phases, but he continued among the unsuccessful 
many in this industiy and finally turned his attention from the search for 
gold into more profitable if less exciting avenues of work. In the spring of 
1876 he left the Cariboo district and went to Cassiar, where he spent the 
summer, and in 1877 he came to Nanaimo, where he has since enjoyed an 
increasingly useful and prosperous career. He first employed himself in 
carpentering and then clerked in an outfitting store, and in 1880 he received 
his appointment as government agent, an office which he has filled to the 
present time. He is also gold commissioner, assistant commissioner of lands 
and works for the district, and registrar of births, deaths and marriages, and 
his administration of all these places of trust has been characterized by the 
utmost efficiency and fidelity. 

Mr. Bray was married in October, 1883, to Miss Sarah J. Randle, a 
daughter of the late Joseph Randle, of Nanaimo. Mr. and Mrs. Bray have 
two sons. Harry Randle, the elder, was a competitor for the first Cecil 
Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University, an honor which, owing to the 
celebrity of the donor and the wide diffusion of these scholarships over the, 
world, may be said to be national. He graduated from the Toronto Univer-I 
sity in the class of 1905. The younger son, William Edgar, is attending] 
high school in Nanaimo. 

ANGUS WYLLIE KENNING, M. D. 

Dr. Angus Wyllie Kenning, engaged in the practice of medicine in' 
Rossland, was born in Elmira, Ontario, February 23, 1868, his parents 
being James H. and Marion (Campbell) Kenning. The father is an in-j 
spector of inland revenue for the Guelph district and he and his wife are] 
still residents of Ontario. 

Mr. Kenning of this review pursued his education in the public schoolsl 
of Prescott, Ontario, continuing his studies until he had mastered .the high 
school course. His ambition lay along professional lines and desirous ofj 
becoming a member of the medical fraternity lie took up the study of medi- 
cine in the Detroit College of Medicine, from which institution he was grad-J 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 479 

uated with the class of 1895. He entered upon practice in Duluth, Minne- 
sota, where he remained for a year and a half, and in the fall of 1896 he 
came to Rossland, where he has since resided, having now for eight years 
successfully followed his chosen calling in this place. He is a capable prac- 
titioner with full understanding of the principles of the science of medi- 
cine, and constant reading and investigation keep him in touch with the 
advanced thought of the day. He is a coroner for the province of British 
Columbia. 

In 1889 Mr. Kenning was united in marriage to Miss Agnes A. Miller, 
a daughter of Robert Miller, of Dorchestershire, England, and they have 
two children, Gordon and Stuart. Dr. Kenning belongs to the Masonic 
fraternity, having attained the Knight Templar degree, and he is also afifili- 
ated with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, while his religious con- 
nection is with the Presbyterian church. 

WILLIAM J. MATHERS. 

William J. Mathers, manager of the Brackman-Kerr Milling Company 
at New Westminster, has been prominently identified with the industrial, 
business and public interests of this city for many years. He has been suc- 
cessful as a result of his own efforts, and the fact that he has been winning 
his own way ever since he was fourteen years old indicates that his accom- 
plishments in the world of practical affairs have been well deserved. 

Mr. Mathers' early education was obtained in the public schools, and 
when he arrived at the age of fourteen he became a clerk in a mercantile 
establishment in New Westminster, where he got valuable business experi- 
ence as well as earning his living. In 1888 he engaged in the produce busi- 
ness with the late D. S. Milligan. He became identified with the Brackman- 
Kerr Milling Company in 1892, and since that date has been the local man- 
ager of its New Westminster branch. 

Mr. Mathers' politics is Conservative. He takes a prominent part in 
local civic matters. He is president of the New^ Westminster board of trade 
and the Westminster Creamery Society, and during the past year has served 
as president of the Westminster Club. 

THOMAS WATSON. 

Thomas Watson, who is the chief of the Victoria fire department and 
a native son of the city in which he makes his home, was born on the 24th 
of May, 1865. His father, Alexander Watson, was a native of Dundee, 
Scotland, born in 1829. He pursued his education in his native land and 



480 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

learned the ship-builder's trade, serving an apprenticeship on the Clyde, 
which was the government ship-building center. He afterward made his 
way to Victoria, and was there residing when his family arrived by sailing 
vessel, King Oscar, in 1864, being seven months upon the voyage. He 
had married Miss Ann Wilson, a native of Scotland and she and her two 
sons, Alexander, Jr., and Robert, came to British Columbia in 1864. They 
settled in Victoria and the father there worked at his trade as a journeyman. 
A little later, however, he engaged in ship-building on his own account 
and had the credit of building all the river boats for Captain Irving and later 
for the captain's son, Captain John Irving. Among these were the Reli- 
ance, Glenora, Elizabeth J. Irving, R. P. Rithel and various other boats. 
Mr. Watson was a Presbyterian in his religious faith and was a member of 
the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. In the family were six children: 
Alexander, Jr., Robert, Thomas, James D., George and Bella. The daugh- 
ter is now acting as her father's housekeeper, for the mother departed this 
life in 1876, in the thirty-sixth year of her age. The son Robert was acci- 
dentally killed by the falling of a limb of a tree, while he was engaged in 
getting out crooks for vessels. 

Thomas Watson, whose name introduces this record, was educated in 
the public schools of Victoria, pursuing the work of the high school there, 
and after putting aside his text books entered upon his business career. He 
has followed various pursuits. He was first a sheep herder and at the age of 
seventeen years he entered upon an apprenticeship to the machinist trade in 
the Albion Iron Works. After acquiring a fair knowledge of the trade he 
went to Oregon, where he was employed as a machinist in the railroad 
shops. Subsequently he removed to San Francisco, where he entered the 
employ of the San Francisco Bridge Company and was soon given charge 
of the construction of several of their large bridges. After a continuance 
of that business connection for three years he returned to Victoria and was 
engaged in electrical work, constructing an electrical establishment and fin- 
ishing and fitting up all kinds of electrical plants. 

Mr. Watson has been connected with the fire department from his 
lx)yhood in different capacities, associated therewith when it was a volun- 
teer organization and since it has become a pay department. He was made 
captain of the company and in 1900 he was appointed chief of the Victoria 
fire department, for which important position his knowledge of mechanics, 
electricity and steam has amply qualified him. He has charge of all of the 
fire apparatus and of all the supplies, and during a fire has command not 
only of the firemen but of the citizens and the surrounding property. He 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 481 

has made the department a very efficient organization, its work being car- 
ried on systematically, and in case of emergency Mr. Watson is found to be 
clear-headed, his mind acting with decision and rapidity, so that he directs 
the labors of his men to the best possible advantage. 

In 1890 occurred the marriage of Thomas Watson and Miss Chris- 
tiana St. Clair, who was born in Victoria and is a daughter of William St. 
Clair, who became the pioneer settler of British Columbia, who was con- 
nected with the Hudson's Bay Company. Mr. and Mrs. Watson have had 
five children, three sons and two daughters, namely: James A., William G., 
Thomas M., Doris Marjory and Ethel Gladys. Mrs. Watson's father 
reached the age of seventy-five years and her mother is still living in her 
sixty-eighth year. There were three sons and eight daughters in that family. 
Mrs. Watson was reared in. the faith of the Church of England, while Mr. 
Watson is of the Presbyterian faith. He belongs to the Native Sons of the 
province and he and his family enjoy the high esteem of many friends in 
Victoria. Almost his entire life has been passed in this city and in the 
present responsible position which he now fills he has done effective service 
for his fellow townsmen. 

CHARLES EDWARD DICKIE. 

Charles Edward Dickie, of Duncans, has been largely interested in the 
development of the material resources of his district, and has left his impress 
on a number of enterprises which have stimulated industry and added to 
the wealth-producing powers of British Columbia. He is a successful busi- 
ness man, possessed of a high degree of public spirit, and during a career 
marked by much strenuous activity he has gained the esteem of all his fellow 
citizens and made himself an influence in affairs. 

Born in Oxford, Ontario, September 14, 1858, Mr. Dickie is a son of 
James and Lucretia (Burdick) Dickie, who are both living in Ontario. He 
was educated in the public schools of Ontario and then in the University of 
Michigan at Ann Arbor, after which he went to work at inspecting lumber 
and logs in northern Michigan and also learned telegraphy. Continuing at 
that until 1885, he then went out to California, locating in Los Angeles and 
in San Diego, and did some farming near Anaheim. After spending two 
years in California he came up to the Puget Sound country, and later located 
at Victoria, British Columbia, where he was in railroad employ for about 
three years. He then became a hotel proprietor at Duncans, and while in 
that business he became interested in the Tyee copper mine, being active in 
interesting sufficient capital for its development. A short time, later he re- 



482 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

tired from the hotel business and identified himself exclusively with mining. 
He sen'^ed as managing director of the Richard the Third mine and the Cop- 
per King mine, and also organized the company to work the Leach river 
diggings and put in hydraulic works there, but this latter enterprise was 
unsuccessful. At the present time he has large interests in timber lands and 
in farming operations. 

Mr. Dickie is a Conservative in politics, and in 1897 was elected a mem- 
ber of the provincial parliament, an office which he held, serving his constit- 
uents faithfully and public-spiritedly, until 1900, when he refused the prof- 
fered nomination for another term. He is a prominent Mason, being af- 
filiated with Temple Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., and with the Victoria command- 
ery, and also belongs to the Odd Fellows order. He and his family are 
Presbyterians in religion. He was married in 1888 to Miss Eliza E. Cal- 
vert, a daughter of Peter Calvert, of Skipton, England, and they have one 
child, Herbert William. 

CAPTAIN W. HART-McHARG. 

Captain William Hart-McHarg, of Vancouver, barrister, author and 
soldier, was born in the barracks at Kilkenny, Ireland, w'here his father was 
at that time stationed with his regiment. His natal day was February 16, 
1869, and he is descended from Scotch ancestry. He is a son of Major 
William Hart-McHarg, who was in the old Forty-fourth, now known as 
the Essex, regiment for many years. His father saw service in the Crimean 
and Chinese wars, for which he received four medals and four clasps. He 
retired from the army with a special pension, given him for meritorious and 
distinguished service. He married Miss Jane Thomsett, a daughter of 
Captain Thomsett of the same regiment, who also served through the 
Crimean and Chinese campaigns. 

William Hart-McHarg pursued his education in England and in Bel- 
gium, but when sixteen years of age he started out in life on his own ac- 
count. Believing that the new world would offer him superior opportunities 
for advancement, he made his way to Manitoba, where he followed farming 
for five years. When in his twenty-first year he removed to Winnipeg and, 
desirous of entering professional life, he devoted five years to the study of 
law and then successfully passed the examinations which secured his admis- 
sion to the Manitoba bar in 1895. He practiced law in that province for 
two years and in 1897, attracted by the mining activity in the Kootenay coun- 
try, he canie to British Columbia, and having been called to the bar of this 
province took up the practice of his profession in Rossland. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 483 

Always interested in military life, he attached himself to the Winnipeg 
Dragoons while in that city and upon the formation of the Rocky Mountain 
Rangers in the Kootenay he joined that organization as a private and later 
attained the rank of lieutenant. Upon the breaking out of the war in South 
Africa he volunteered for the First Contingent, the Royal Canadian Regi- 
ment, and being unable to obtain commissioned rank he enlisted as a private. 
During the campaign he was promoted to sergeant. The Canadian Militia 
list gives the following record of his war service : " Operations in Orange 
Free State, February-May, 1900, including operations at Paardeberg' (18-26 
February), and actions at Poplar Grove (7 March), Dreifontein (10 
March), Hout Nek (i May), Zand River (i May) ; operations in the Trans- 
vaal in May and June, including actions near Johannesburg (29 May), Pre- 
toria (4 June). Operations in Orange River Colony and eastern and west- 
ern Transvaal, June-November, 1900. Medal with four clasps." 

On the return of his regiment to Canada Mr. McHarg resumed his law 
practice in Rossland. He continued his connection with the anny, was re- 
instated as lieteuant in the Rocky Mountain Rangers and was soon afterwards 
promoted to the rank of captain. In November, 1902, he removed to Van- 
couver, where he established his home. He was transferred to the Sixth 
Regiment, " The Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles," and is now captain of 
a company in that organization. 

Captain McHarg has also given evidence of literary ability, having 
written and published a book on the South African war, entitled " From 
Quebec to Pretoria." It has met with a good sale and has been highly com- 
mended. He is a Liberal in politics and has been president of several Lib- 
eral associations. He is giving close attention to his law practice and therein 
is acquiring a very satisfactory clientage, while his social, political and mili- 
tary prominence class him with the leading and representative young men 
of Vancouver. 

JOHN A. J. HONEYMAN. 

John A. J. Honeyman, whose active connection with industrial interests 
makes him a leading factor in business circles in Nelson, is now engaged in 
the manufacture of engines, boilers, sawmills, quartz mills and mining ma- 
chinery, also architectural iron work and iron and brass castings, and the 
quality of the workmanship of his foundry and shops is Such as has brought 
to him a liberal patronage. He was born in Quebec in February, 1841, and 
was reared in Kingston, Ontario. He acquired his education at Queen's 
College in Kingston and in his youth became connected with the machinist's 



484 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

trade, working in his father's foundry, where he was employed from 1856 
until i860. He left Kingston to go to New York city, where he was em- 
ployed for a short time as a journeyman and was then promoted to the posi- 
tion of foreman. He continued there until September, 1868, when he sailed 
for San P^rancisco, obtaining employment in the Union Iron Works, a posi- 
tion which he occupied for a little more than a year. He next removed to 
Portland, Oregon, where he worked as a journeyman for a short time, when 
again his capability won him advancement to the position of foreman. 

In 1873 his father and three brothers formed a partnership and estab- 
lished the City Foundry &amp; Machine Shops at Portland, Oregon, conducting 
this enterprise with gratifying success until 1886, when the partnership was 
dissolved. Mr. Honeyman of this review then accepted the position of 
superintendent with the National Linseed Oil Company, acting in that capac- 
ity for two years, when he resigned in order to again enter the foundry busi- 
ness on his own account. He conducted his enterprise for two years, but 
did not meet with the success he had anticipated and he therefore removed 
his plant to Nelson, British Columbia, in 1897. He built a foundry and 
machine shop in Bogustown, and met with good success there. In July, 
1904, he built a new shop in Nelson at the corner of Hill and Water streets, 
and is now conducting a fair business, meeting with a desirable measure of 
prosperity. 

In 1864 Mr. Honeyman was united in marriage to Miss Jane E. Power, 
a resident of Birmingham, England, and they have five children : David A., 
William A., Charles J., Mabel M., and Benjamin F. Mr. Honeyman is a 
member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and also belongs to the 
Congregational church. His life record is an exemplification of the fact 
that success may be won through persistent purpose, capable management 
and laudable ambition, for starting out in life with no capital Mr. Honeyman 
has steadily worked his way upward, brooking no obstacles that could be 
overcome by determined and honorable effort. He is now a respected rep- 
resentative of the business interests of Nelson, enjoying the full confidence of 
the business community. 

WILLIAM GARLAND McQUARRIE. 

William Garland McQuarrie, member of the law firm of Martin, Weart 
and McQuarrie, of New Westminster and Vancouver, is a prominent young 
representative of the bar of this province. Born in 1876, at Ottawa, Ontario, 
Mr. McQuarrie is a son of a well known citizen of New Westminster, Lachlan 
McQuarrie, a native of Ontario, as is also his wife, Mary (McKinnon) Mc- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 485 

Quarrie. Lachlan McQuarrie was a prominent railroad and public works 
contractor in Ottawa. He came west to Winnipeg- in 1881, and in 1886 to 
British Columbia, of which province he has since been a resident. He has 
been identified with many large contracts in this province. Among his im- 
portant undertakings were the installation of the water works system in New 
Westminster, at Vernon, at Winnipeg and at Ottawa. 

Having been brought to British Columbia when a child, Mr. McQuarrie 
received most of his elementary education in the province. He also attended 
Osgood Hall at Toronto. At the age of eighteen he left school in order to 
take up the study of law, and became a student under Hon. Aulay Morrison, 
Hon. Richard McBride, now premier, and the late Chief Justice McColl, all 
acknowledged leaders in the legal fraternity. In 1900 he received admission 
to the bar, and after a year spent at Ashcroft he entered the well known firm 
of Morrison, Whiteside, McQuarrie and Briggs' at New Westminster. When 
Mr. Morrison was elevated to the supreme bench in 1904, Mr. McQuarrie 
formed a partnership with Messrs. Martin and Weart, of Vancouver, the 
firm now being as given at the beginning of this sketch. They have offices 
both in New Westminster and Vancouver, and Mr. McQuarrie's home is in 
the former city. Hon. Joseph Martin, K. C, is the head of this firm. 

In politics Mr. McQuarrie is an active Conservative, being secretary of 
the Conservative Association at New Westminster. Fraternally he affiliates 
with the Masons and with the Woodmen of the World. 

HON. J. H. TURNER, 
Agent-General of British Columbia in London. 

The following account appeared in the Daily Colonist upon his leaving 
for England to fill his present position: 

"John Herbert Turner was the son of John Turner, of Ipswich, Eng- 
land, and was bom at Playden, near Ipswich, Suffolk, in 1834. He was 
educated at Whitestable near Canterbury, and left England in 1856 for 
Halifax, N. S. After residing at Halifax for two years, he removed to 
Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and began business there. While 
living in Charlottetown he took a leading part in the organization of the 
first volunteer rifle corps in that province, of which he continued to be an 
active member until he left for British Columbia in 1862. This corps, in 
conjunction with other country corps, to the number of a thousand, turned 
out to welcome the Prince of Wales on his visit to Prince Edward Island 
in 1861. It was in 1862 that the reports of British Columbia's marvellous 



486 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

richness had their greatest influence in Eastern Canada, and hundreds of 
the best and most energetic young men from all the provinces abandoned 
established businesses, assured prospects, and unsurpassed opportunities, for 
the dream of untold wealth to be gathered from the goldfields. 

" On July 2, 1862, Mr. Turner arrived in Victoria by the steamer 
Oregon, in company with a large number of gold-seekers, many of whom, 
disappointed and discouraged, left the country within a month of their 
landing. A few, however, with more of that combative quality and indom- 
itable energy and perseverance so necessary in the citizens of a young state, 
settled in Victoria, and stuck to her through good and evil report, sharing 
her troubles and trials, and helping to build up the city to its present pros- 
perous condition, 

" Mr. Turner went into business in 1865, and has continued at it 
uninterruptedly since that ti^e. 

" As in Charlottetown, so in Victoria, Mr. Turner was one of the 
original promoters and members of the volunteer rifle organization, and was 
enrolled in the first corps that was formed here, for the defense of the island 
during the Fenian excitement, and threatened raid in 1865. This corps wore 
the celebrated uniform of white blanket coats, with black facings. Mr. Tur- 
ner served through the ranks from private to sergeant, then into the com- 
missioned ranks, and through the various grades, finally retiring to the 
reserve militia with the rank of Lt.-Col. in 1881. 

" He was elected a member of the city council of Victoria in 1876, 
and served for three years, till 1879, when he was elected mayor by accla- 
mation, and served the city through three terms in that position. He 
was chairman of the British Columbia Benevolent Society, and also of the 
Royal Hospital from 1879 to 1882, and chairman of the British Columbia 
Agricultural Society for 1881 and 1882. 

" In the general election of 1886, he was elected to represent the city 
of Victoria in the provincial legislature, and joined the government of Hon. 
A. E. B. Davie in 1887, being re-elected in August of that year, after having 
accepted the portfolio of finance minister. At the general election of 1890, 
he was again returned for the city of Victoria and occupied the position of 
finance minister in the government of Hon. John Robson. In 1894, he was 
once again elected by his constituents, and in the cabinet of which Hon. 
Theodore Davie was premier, he continued to administer the finances of the 
province. 

"On Saturday, March 2, 1895, Hon. Theodore Davie resigned the 
premiership, and Mr. Turner was called upon to form a cabinet. He served 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 487 

the province as premier and minister of finance from that time till August, 
1898, when his government was dismissed from office by Lieutenant-Gov- 
ernor Mclnnes, and for the next two sessions he led the opposition. In 
1900, Hon. James Dunsmuir assumed the premiership, and Mr. Turner 
was one of the first invited to enter the new cabinet. He accepted his old 
portfolio of finance, and remained in office till Se:ptember 3, 1901, when he 
retired from office to accept the important position of agent-general of 
British Columbia, in London, England. 

" From the day he entered politics, Mr. Turner always possessed the 
entire confidence of his constituents, and during his long career as a busi- 
ness man and politician, has always taken an active interest in the mining, 
fishing, and other interests of the province, of which he was a foremost 
promoter. He has been connected with most of the large enterprises which 
have had their origin in Victoria, and while his business was centered in 
this city, he had also large commercial interests in other parts of the 
province. 

" Mr. Turner was married in i860 to Miss Eilbeck, of Whithaven, 
Cumberland, England. Mrs. Turner accompanied her husband to England, 
her departure being deeply regretted by her very large circle of friends in 
Victoria, and throughout the province." 

Mr. Turner has filled the office of agent-general most acceptably, and 
in a great many ways has advanced the interests of the province, being 
instant in and out of season in its behalf. British Columbia has received 
great prominence through his efforts. 

JOHN HORATIO WATSON. 

John Horatio Watson, chief of the New Westminster fire department, 
has been connected with that most important branch of the municipal service 
for sixteen years, and has advanced to the head of the department by steady 
promotions based on efficiency and merit as a firefighter, with courage and 
coolness and skill tested in many a hard-fought battle with the destroying 
element. It is a fact of which the citizens of New Westminster feel very 
proud that their fire department ranks with the best in the northwest when 
the size of the city is considered, and it is therefore a position of honor as 
well as of utmost responsibility to be its chief. 

Mr. Watson, who is yet a young man, being only twenty-two when he 
entered the department, was born' in Durham, Grey county, Ontario, in 1867. 
His, parents were Robert and Dinah (Gadd) Watson. His father was a 



488 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Grey county farmer for many years, and later moved to Algoma in West- 
em Ontario, where he still lives. 

After an education in the common and grammar schools of Grey county 
Mr. Watson left school at the age of sixteen, and began learning the stone- 
mason's trade. In 1885 he came to British Columbia, and continued to 
follow his trade in New Westminster until 1889. In the latter year he was 
appointed driver in the fire department. From this post he was promoted to 
chemical engineer, then to captain, and in 1899 came his appointment as chief 
of the department, which office he has since done so much to honor. The 
fire-fighting equipment of New Westminster contains the most modern ap- 
paratus, and that combined with the efficiency and discipline of the men 
makes the entire service of the highest standard. The water supply is from 
gravity pressure, it befng piped from Lake Couquillam, a distance of fourteen 
miles, to a reservoir on a high altitude above the city, so that, at low level, 
there is a pressure of one hundred and seventy-three pounds to the inch. 
The New Westminster fire service has undergone a complete reorganization 
and transformation since the disastrous fire in 1898, which destroyed the en- 
tire business section of the city, and which brought home to the citizens and 
authorities the necessity of a first class fire department. Since then new and 
modern apparatus has l^een added and everything done to make the service 
equal to the demands of a growing city. 

Mr. Watson was married in 1893 to Miss Nellie Deans, of Grand Val- 
ley, Ontario. She died in the following year, and left one son, Albert Bert- 
land. In 1902 Mr. Watson took for his second wife Miss Margaret Murray, 
of Woodstock, Ontario. By this marriage also there is a son, Robert Mur- 
ray. Mr. Watson affiliates with the Knights of Pythias, and is one of the 
popular and highly esteemed citizens of New Westminster. 

CHARLES ROBERT HAMILTON, K. C. 

Charles Robert Hamilton, K. C, barrister at law and mayor of the 
city of Rossland, was born in the city of Quebec in 1867. His father, Charles 
Hamilton, a native of Quebec, is Bishop of Ottawa in the Church of England, 
and one of the foremost ecclesiastics of his day, whose work and influence 
have been of lasting value to his church and to social and religious welfare. 
Mr. Hamilton's mother, Frances Louisa Hume (Thompson) Hamilton, was 
born in England, a daughter of Commissary-General Thompson, at one time 
stationed in the city of Toronto. Mr. Hamilton was educated at Bishop's 
College School in Lennoxville, Quebec, and at Kebbe College, Oxford, and 
graduated with second class 'honors from the University of Oxford in 1888, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 489 

with the degree of B. A. Returning to Canada in 1889 he took his law 
course in Osgood Hall, and came to British Columbia in 1892, while in Janu- 
ary of the following year he was admitted to the bar of this province. He 
practiced law in Vancouver with A. St. G. Hammersley until 1896, and since 
that year has been located and engaged in active practice in Rossland. Since 
1900 he has served as alderman and in January, 1905, was elected mayor of 
that city. He is a bencher of the Law Society, a justice of the peace for the 
province of British Columbia and was in April, 1905, appointed a king's 
counsel. 

In 1900 Mr. Hamilton married Miss Edith Bell Wilson, a daughter of 
W. B. Wilson, a pioneer of British Columbia. They are the parents of four 
children, named Charles Hamwood, Edith Frances Mary, Violet Craigie and 
Isobel Joan. 

VICTORIA CHEMICAL WORKS. 

The Victoria Chemical Works is one of the most important manufac- 
turing enterprises of Victoria. It was established in 1892 and has since 
been in continuous operation and productive of great material value to the 
city in which it is located. This is the only establishment in British Colum- 
bia where suphuric acid, nitric acid and muriatic acid are manufactured for 
commercial purposes, and the plant is one of the most extensive of its kind. 
The crude materials for these products are brought here in immense quanti- 
ties, sulphur being brought from Japan by the shipload, as is also the case 
with nitre from South America. ' Chemical fertilizers form a large share of 
the yearly output of the plant, and the trade in this material is yearly increas- 
ing as its importance is realized and its use extended. Thirty-five to forty 
men are employed in the \vorks, and these alone form the nucleus of a pros- 
perous little community which gains its support through the operations of 
this industry. 

The Victoria Chemical Works were founded by Englishmen from Man- 
chester, who came out to Victoria and established their homes in the city 
that they might give their personal attention and efforts to the development 
of this important enterprise. The proprietors and founders are Messrs. J. 
W. Fisher, John A. Hall and Frederick Moore, who are the directors and 
managers of the business, and it is due to their energy and organizing ability 
that the institution has so soon attained a flourishing- status among the manu- 
factories of the northwest coast. Since taking up their residence in Vic- 
toria these gentlemen have shown their public spirit in numberless ways, and 
are ardent coadjutors in all movements looking to the permanent improve- 
ment and upbuilding of the city. 



490 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

RICHARD H. ALEXANDER. 

Richard H. Alexander, secretary and local manager of the British Co- 
lumbia Mills, Timber &amp; Trading Company, is a British Columbia pioneer 
of 1862. A native of Scotland, he was born on the 26th of March, 1844, 
representing one of the old families of that country. His father, James 
Alexander, was born in Scotland, as was his wife, who bore the maiden 
name of Eliza Scott, Five children were born unto them in Scotland and 
with their family they emigrated to Canada in 1855. The father was a 
wine merchant in Edinburgh and followed the same pursuit in Toronto. 
Later he returned to Scotland, where he died at the age of fifty years. 

Richard H. Alexander remained in Toronto until 1862, when at the 
age of eighteen years, he joined a company bound overland for British Co- 
lumbia and went to Fort Garry, the Winnipeg of those days, while later 
he made the trip with oxen and Red River carts to Edmonton, thence across 
the mountains to the head waters of the Eraser river and down that stream 
to Westminster. His first winter was spent in cutting cord wood at a dollar 
and a half per cord and some of the trees were of such proportions that 
a single section of four feet cut up into a cord of wood. In 1863 Mr. 
Alexander went to the Cariboo mines, but was not very successful in placer 
mining. There was gold in that country, but it was not near enough the 
surface to make mining profitable. Later he obtained work as a helper in 
a pack train, taking food supplies to the mines. Upon his return to Vic- 
toria he worked for the Hudson's Bay Company as a longshoreman on the 
wharfs and afterwards secured a clerkship in a store, occupying that position 
until he came to Vancouver in 1870. Here he accepted a position as ac- 
countant in the employ of the Hastings Sawmill Company and in 1882 he 
became manager of the company, with which he has been actively con- 
nected for the past thirty-four years. His management has had much to 
do with the great success that the company has attained. 

There were but six acres of land cleared when Mr. Alexander came 
to the place where the splendid city of Vancouver now stands and the 
remainder was covered with a dense forest. During all of the early growth 
and development of the town he was associated with nearly every movement 
or enterprise tliat had to do with its upbuilding and progress along the lines 
of material, intellectual, social and political advancement. He was secre- 
tary of the school board, was notary public, also justice of the peace and 
a member of the board of health. In fact, was the only member of the last 
named for a time. After the organization of the city government he was 



II .VI i' i' 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 491 

made a member of the city council and acted in that capacity for a num- 
ber of years. He became chairman of the pilotage board and in 189091 
was president of the Board of Trade of the city and is now a member of 
the council and of the board of arbitration of that body. He is like- 
wise serving on the committees on railways and navigations and it may 
be truthfully said of him that he has been one of the city's best and most 
reliable business men and one of the most devoted upbuilders. He has not 
only w^on. success here, but is at the present time one of the two oldest resi- 
dents of Vancouver and he enjoys the confidence and high esteem of his 
fellow citizens. 

Mr. Alexander was married in Victoria in 1867 to Miss Emma Tam- 
madge, a native of London, England, and unto them have been born four 
children, all natives of British Columbia. They are Richard H. H., now 
secretary of the British Columbia Timber &amp; Shingle Manufacturing Asso- 
ciation; Frederick W., who is connected with the lumber business at Seattle, 
Washington; Eliza Scott, now the wife of J. L, G. Abbott, registrar of 
titles for the city of Vancouver; and Harry O., stipendiary magistrate of 
the city. 

Mr. and Mrs. Alexander are communicants of the Church of England 
and he is a Royal Arch Mason.. The family occupy a delightful home 
in Vancouver and their circle of friends is limited only by the circle of 
their acquaintances. In the forty-two years of his residence in British 
Columbia his activity has been so carefully directed and his celerity of action 
has been so marked that he stands today as one of the most conspicuous 
promoters of the progress and prosperity of the province. 

ROBERT GEORGE MACPHERSON, M. P. 

Robert George Macpherson, w-ell known in Vancouver because of his 
active efforts in political circles and his prominence as a representative of 
commercial interests, was born in the province of Ontario, the place of his 
nativity being in Erin, Wellington county, while his natal day was January 
28, 1866. His grandfather, Hugh Macpherson, was born on the island of 
Islay off the coast of Scotland, and in 1858 crossed the Atlantic to Waterloo 
county, Canada. His son, Archibald H. Macpherson, was born on the west 
coast of Scotland and accompanied his father and the family to the new 
world. Many representatives of the name have been school teachers, and 
Archibald Macpherson made that profession his life work. He married Miss 
Jeanette Hall, who was born in the township in Wellington county in which 
her marriage was celebrated and in which her son, Robert G., was afterward 



492 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

born. For many years Mr. Macpherson was a promoter of the educational 
development of his district and his labors were a valued factor in intellectual 
progress. He died in 1891 in the fifty-fourth year of his age and is still 
survived by his widow, who has reached the age of sixty-three years. Two 
of their children are now in British Columbia, Robert G. and Mrs. F. McD. 
Russell, of Vancouver. 

Robert George Macpherson acquired his preliminary education in the 
Arthur public schools and afterward attended the Gait Collegiate Institute. 
In early life he entered upon a business relation which gave him intimate 
and comprehensive knowledge of the drug business, but is not now conduct- 
ing business. 

Mr. Macpherson has always been a Liberal in his political views and 
has always taken a deep interest in the questions affecting the public and 
touching the general interests of society. On the 4th of February, 1903, he 
was elected to the Dominion parliament by the city of Vancouver, has served 
on a number of important committees and has taken an active part in all of 
the legislation of the sessions, doing all in his power to promote the interests 
of British Columbia. His labors in this direction have been attended with 
gratifying results and the public acknowledges its indebtedness to him for 
capable service rendered. He was re-elected on the 4th of November, 1904, 
at the general election, by a majority of nearly nine hundred, the city of Van- 
couver thus confirming him in his seat for a full parliamentary term of five 
years. 

In 1890 Mr. Macpherson was married to Miss Susan Van Aken, a native 
of Coldwater, Michigan, and they have three children, all born in British 
Columbia, namely: Brita, Bessie and Archie, The parents are members 
of St. John's Presbyterian church and Mr. Macpherson belongs to Mount 
Hermon lodge, No. 7, A. F. &amp; A. M., and to the Knights of Pythias frater- 
nity. Coming to British Columbia to enjoy its splendid business opportuni- 
ties that have been advanced through the rapid development and settlement of 
this portion of the country, he has made for himself a commendable place in 
commercial circles in this city and has gained success and an honorable name 
as a leading merchant here. 

JOSEPH H. BOWES. 

Joseph H. Bowes, a barrister with a large and influential practice at 
New Westminster, has been a resident of British Columbia during the past 
fourteen or fifteen years, and is a Canadian by birth and training. He is 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 493 

an able lawyer, and is a public-spirited worker in the ranks of good citizen- 
ship. 

Mr. Bowes was born in December, 1863, at Toronto, Ontario, a son 
of John C. and Anwt Bowes. John C. Bowes filled the position of mayor 
of the city of Toronto for a period of six years. He was educated at the 
Upper Canada College and the University of Toronto, and after his gradua- 
tion from the latter in 1884 he took up the study of law, being admitted to 
the bar in 1888. The first years of his practice were in Toronto, and in 1891 
he came out to this province, where he had his office first in Nelson, and for 
some years has been located at New Westminster, with a profitable patron- 
age. He is a member of the Greek letter fraternity Zeta Psi. 

W. B. COOKE. 

W. B. Cooke, of the firm of Cooke &amp; Tait, manufacturers of lumber and 
red cedar shingles, was born in Orillia, Ontario, on the 7th of January, 1876, 
and in the paternal line comes of Irish and Scotch ancestry. His father, 
Walter Cooke, was born in Ontario, where the grandfather. Rev. John Cooke, 
had located at an early day. They were Scotch Presbyterians in religious 
faith and the grandfather was a minister of that church. Walter Cooke 
moved from Canada to Rockford, Illinois, where for many years he was 
superintendent of an msurance company. In his native province he was 
united in marriage to Miss Virginia Taylor, a representative of an old Vir- 
ginian family of cotton planters. Prior to the Civil war the Taylors had a 
large plantation and one hundred and fifty slaves and they were wealthy and 
influential citizens of Virginia. 

W. B. Cooke, the only member of his father's family in British Colum- 
bia, pursued his education in the collegiate institute of his native town and 
for some time engaged in reading law, thinking to become a member of the 
bar, but abandoning that plan he accepted a position as accountant with the 
firm of George Vick &amp; Sons, doing an extensive wholesale business as dealers 
in grain. Becoming impressed with the advantages of the west Mr. Cooke 
resolved to try his fortune on the Pacific coast and in 1899 arrived in the 
province of British Columbia. He was for two years thereafter employed 
as accountant by W. L. Tait, and the present firm of Cooke &amp; Tait was then 
lurnied. His partner is Edward R. Tait. He was practically reared in the 
lumber and shingle business and is a practical mill man, his father having 
been one of the largest shingle manufacturers of Canada and having the 
credit of making the first sawed shingles in the province. The firm of Cooke 
&amp; Tait was formed in 1901 and they have since engaged in the manufacture 



494 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of lumber of all dimensions and red cedar shingles. The mill capacity is 
thirty-five thousand feet of lumber in ten hours and one hundred thousand 
shingles in the same time. After manufacturing shingles for two and a half 
years they built the sawmill and then embarked in the manufacture of lum- 
ber, and the business has met with a continuous and satisfactory growth. 
Mr. Tait gives his personal supervision to the manufacturing department, 
Mr. Cooke to the business management, and they constitute a successful firm. 
Mr. Cooke is a young man not yet thirty years of age, but in his career has 
displayed business enterprise and sagacity that have led to creditable success 
and would do honor to a man of much greater age. He possesses the enter- 
prising spirit which has been the dominant quality in the upbuilding and de- 
velopment of the Pacific coast country and what he undertakes he carries for- 
ward to successful completion, brooking no obstacles that can be overcome 
by strong and determined purpose and honorable effort. He is an attendant 
of St. Andrew's Presbyterian church. 

ADAM SWART VEDDER. . 

Adam Swart Vedder, prominent pioneer freighter, rancher and general 
farmer, man of affairs, has been a resident of the province for nearly forty- 
five years, and during an active career beginning when he was a boy in his 
teens he has prosecuted every undertaking with energy and resolution that 
brings results and has won success in a most laudable manner. His principal 
activity has been centered about Chilliwack in New Westminster district, and 
as one of the oldest citizens of this vicinity he is accordingly honored and 
esteemed both for the* sterling worth of his character and for what he has 
accomplished in a material way. 

Of New York Dutch stock, with sturdy ancestral lines stretching back 
for numerous generations, Mr. Vedder was born in Schenectady, New York, 
July 27, 1834, being a son of Volkert and Agnes (Swart) Vedder, both of 
whom are long since deceased. After an education in the public schools of 
his native city, he passed into the practical affairs of life at an early age, 
and in 1846 moved west to Chicago, which was his home for some five or 
six years. In April, 1852, being then a strong and vigorous youth of 
eighteen, he made the overland journey to the Pacific coast, reaching Sacra- 
mento, California, on August 12, 1852. He engaged in freighting to the 
mines, and continued in the golden state for about eight years. In May, 
i860, he came up to British Columbia, and after spending the winter at 
Sumas continued the freighting business in this country. He drove the 
first big team over the Yale road on its completion in 1865. He followed 





■' // / 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 495 

freighting until 1868, and then preempted land near Sumas, beginning the 
ranching operations which he has continued with so much success for over 
thirty-five years. He added to his estate by purchase until he owned twelve 
hundred acres in that vicinity. He settled on his present fine place of two 
hundred and ninety acres in 1882, and cleared and broke all the land himself, 
in the course of a few years evolving one of the model farms- of the Chilli- 
wack valley. In 1890 he erected his present residence, which is the finest in 
the valley. 

Mr. Vedder was married in January, 1877, to Mrs. Althea Dicker, of 
Chilliwack, who died in 1892, leaving one child. In 1894 Mr. Vedder was 
married tO' Elizabeth Jackman, of Chilliwack. Mr. Vedder is a member of 
Ionic Lodge No. 19, A. F. &amp; A. M., and adheres to the Presbyterian de- 
nomination. A Liberal in politics, he was elected in 1897 to the provincial 
parliament to fill out an unexpired term. He was warden of municipality in 
1878, and has been city councilman several terms. 

CHARLES WILLIAM MUNRO. 

Charles William Munro, member of the provincial parliament and a 
prominent "citizen of Chilliwack, has been a resident of the Chilliwack valley 
for over fifteen years, and has not only attained to a commendable degree of 
private prosperity, but has also evinced an eminent degree of public spirit 
and has made himself a valuable factor in public afifairs and advancement 
of the best interests of the province and community. 

Mr. Munro is a son of Asael and Charlotte Ann (Barclay) Munro, well 
known residents of the Chilliwack valley. He was born in Dundas county, 
Ontario, March 15, 1864, and was educated in the grammar and high schools 
of that county. He fitted for ministerial work, and for two years before 
going to university traveled as a Methodist clergyman. He attended Coburg 
University, and is a finely educated and well informed man, of broad-gauged 
principles and progressive and enterprising in all his undertakings. He 
came out to British Columbia in 1888 to seek a climate and country more 
beneficial to his health, and he has ever since been a prominent resident of 
the Chilliwack valley. 

Mr. Munro was elected to the provincial parliament in 1898, and has 
been twice re-elected, now serving his third term. He belongs to the pro- 
gressive Liberal party, and takes a practical interest in political affairs. He 
was married in 1893 to Miss Sarah Marcellus, a daughter of Alfred Mar- 
cellus, of Dundas county, Ontario. They have one child, Edith.

HON. MONTAGUE W. T. DRAKE. 

Hon. Montague William Trywhitt Drake, who for fifteen years has been 
a judge of the supreme court of British Columbia, is a pioneer of the prov- 
ince, his residence here dating from 1859. Born in Kingswalden, Hertford- 
shire, England, on the 20th of January, 1830, he is descended from the Try- 
whitt Drakes of Shardeloes, Bucks county, and is a son of Rev. George 
Drake, an English clergyman who married Miss Jane Halsey, also a rep- 
resentative of a distinguished old English family. 

Judge Drake was educated at the Charter House school and also re- 
ceived his preparatory training in London. He was admitted as a solicitor 
and counselor of law to the supreme courts of. England in 1851, and practiced 
his profession in his native country until 1859, when attracted by the business 
opportunities of the great and growing northwest he made his way to British 
Columbia. He had sailed from Liverpool to Quebec and after spending a 
short time in Canada came to Victoria by way of New York and the Isthmus 
of Panama. Recent discoveries of gold led the great majority of those whq 
came to the shores of this country to make their way to the mines, and 
thinking that he might rapidly acquire wealth Judge Drake also went to the 
gold fields and spent some time in searching for the precious metal, but his 
expenses exceeded his receipts and he returned to Victoria to resume his law 
practice. There he entered into partnership with Attorney General Carey, 
a relationship that was maintained for two years. He also took an active 
part in politics, being a close student of the questions and issues of the day, 
and soon afterwards he was elected a member of the legislative council of 
British Columbia, as representative for Victoria. He continuously occupied 
his seat in the house until 1870. He also took a deep interest in the educa- 
tional affairs of his city and served as a member of the board of education 
for British Columbia from 1872 until 1879. In 1877 ^^^ was elected mayor 
of the city and in 1882 he was again elected to the legislative assembly to 
represent Victoria. He was president of the executive council from Janu- 
ary, 1883, until October, 1884, and in 1889 he was elevated to the supreme 
bench of the province, where he has served most faithfully and honorably 
for the past fifteen years. His legal learning, his analytical mind, the readi- 
ness with which he grasps the points in an argument, all combine to make 
him one of the most capable jurists that has ever graced the court of last 
resort, and the public and the profession acknowledge him the peer of any 
member of the appellate court. 

In 1862 Judge Drake was married to Miss Joanna Tolmie, a native of 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 497 

Scotland, born in Ardersier, Invernesshire, who died in 1901. He has five 
children, four daughters and a son, all born in Victoria, namely : Maud, 
now the wife of Arthur W. Bridgman; Mildred, the wife of G. Barnardis- 
ton ; Helen, the wife of Arthur Crease ; Brian, who is a barrister and registrar 
of the supreme court; and one unmarried daughter. Judge Drake is a com- 
municant of the Church of England and he is a member of the Pioneer So- 
ciety of the Province. He resides at No. 2 Pleasant street, Victoria. Nature 
has bestowed upon Judge Drake many of her rarest gifts. He possesses a 
mind of broad compass and an industry which has brought forth every spark 
of talent with which nature has gifted him. He is widely recognized in 
every way as a most superior man. 

WILLIAM HUNTER. 

William Hunter, of Silverton, is numbered among the honored pioneers 
of the Kootenay district and his efforts have been of great value in the 
development of this country. He came here when the work of improvement 
and progress had scarcely been begun and the dangers and difficulties which 
always confront the pioneer fell to his lot. The work of the early settler is 
extremely arduous because there are no home products, industries, agricul- 
tural or commercial. Without railroad facilities everything must be trans- 
ported and the conditions called forth every spark of ingenuity and native 
talent possessed by the individual in order that he might use his few equip- 
ments to the best advantage. The country was rich in natural resources and 
Mr. Hunter, identifying his interests with those of the northwest, has been 
an important factor in its industrial, commercial and mining development. 

A native of the province of Quebec, Mr. Hunter was bom September 
28, 1858, about thirty miles from Montreal, Hemmingford county. His 
parents were William and Jannet (Macky) Hunter, the former now residing 
in Prince Edward island, while the latter has passed away. In his early 
boyhood days William Hunter accompanied his parents on their removal 
to Prince Edward Island and acquired his education there in the public 
schools. His father was proprietor of a lumber mill and owner of a farm 
and William Hunter worked with him until he left home, gaining practical 
and comprehensive knowledge of both lines of business. Attracted by the 
glowing descriptions which he had heard of the west and its possibilities 
he came to British Columbia in 1884 and worked on railroad construction 
for two years. He then macle a visit to his old home in the east, after which 
he again came to the Pacific coast, this time locating in the state of Washing- 
ton, where he was engaged in bridge building until 1889. That year wit- 



498 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

nessed his arrival in Nelson, British Columbia. He came here to put up a 
mill and built the first mining mill in the Kootenay district on Toad moun- 
tain at Golden King mine. The same year he went to the Poorman mine 
and worked on a stamp mill for one year, after which he returned to Nelson, 
where he erected the International Hotel, which he conducted for five months. 
He then sold the property to Bruce Craddock and was afterward engaged 
in the construction of a mill at the Whitewater mine. In the fall of 1891 
he went to New Denver, where he embarked in general merchandising, con- 
ducting the store for ten months as a member of the firm of Hunter and 
McKinnon, after which he sold out to Borne Brothers. In 1891 Mr. Hunter 
located the town site of Silverton and he then .organized a company to build 
a steamer on Slocan Lake and completed it in November, 1892. The lum- 
ber had to be all whipped-sawed and cost one hundred and twenty-five dol- 
lars per thousand feet. He secured the services of two boat builders from 
Portland, Oregon, while the machinery was let to a Toronto firm. The 
work was delayed because it required all the summer to get the boilers, 
owing to the failure of the Toronto firm to which he had given the contract. 
It cost six cents per pound to transport a part of the' machinery and the 
boiler was shipped at a cost of three and a half cents per pound. The di- 
mensions of the boat were sixty feet with twelve foot beam and it had twin 
screws. The work was completed at a cost of ten thousand dollars and the 
boat was then launched. Still further Mr. Hunter contributed to the devel- 
opment of the district by opening a store in Silverton in the spring of 1893 
under the name of the Slocan Mercantile Company. In the succeeding fall 
J. Fred Hume, who was a partner, sold his interest and the store was then 
conducted by the firm of Hunter &amp; McKinnon. In 1894 they opened a 
branch store in New Denver, but" in the fall of that year sold out and opened 
another store at Three Forks. In 1896 they established a branch house at 
Sandon and in 1897, having purchased his partner's interest, Mr. Hunter 
incorporated the William Hunter Company. In 1899 he opened a store in 
Brooklyn, which he conducted for about five months, closing out, however, 
on the completion of the railroad. He afterward built a store in Phoenix, 
but later sold his stock there. The building was burned down and Mr. 
Hunter rebuilt it and again stocked it with goods in 1901. He is still pro- 
prietor of that mercantile enterprise. In 1897 he sold the store at Sandon 
to the firm of Hunter Brothers and in 1902 he sold the store at Three Forks 
to John T. Kelly, while in 1903 the firm of Wilson &amp; Barclay became pro- 
prietors of his store at Silverton. He has been the pioneer in inaugurating 







I

C-^ 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 499 

many new inrlustries and commercial interests and his efforts have contrib- 
uted in large and substantial measure to the improvement of the districts 
in whicli he has carried on business. 

Mr. Hunter has found another field of labor in the development of the 
rich mining resources of the country and is now heavily interested in mining 
property. In 1903 he began operating the Comstock mine, which is proving 
a very, paying one. He also has another property on the north fork of Car- 
penter creek called the Rowse mine. These seem to contain an inexhaustible 
supply of ore, which furnished a rich yield, and the business is now profitably 
conducted. 

In 1901 Mr. Hunter was united in marriage to Miss Maggie Parsons, 
a daughter of Robert Parsons, of New Westminster, and they have one 
child, Helen. Mr. Hunter belongs to Kaslo lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., and is 
also a member of the Presbyterian church. He served as justice of the 
peace in Silverton for seven years and has been a co-operant factor in 
many progressive measures that have had for their object the benefit of the 
comm.unity. He belongs to the little group of distinctively representative 
business men who have been the pioneers in inaugurating and building up 
the chief industries of this section of the country. He early had the sagacity 
and prescience to discern the eminence which the future had in store for 
this great and growing country, and, acting in accordance with the dictates 
of his faith and judgment, he has garnered, in the fullness of time, the 
generous harvest which is the just recompense of indomitable industry, spot- 
less integrity and marvelous enterprise and in business he has achieved suc- 
cess through honorable effort, untiring industry and capable management. 

JONATHAN REECE. 

Jonathan Reece, who died June 4, 1904, was one of the oldest and most 
honored of the citizens of Chilliwack, and his life, reaching beyond the 
seventieth milestone, was exceedingly busy, useful and worthy in all deeds 
and aspirations. He identified himself closely with the affairs of his home 
community, was always ready to devote his energies to some public-spirited 
enterprise, was liberal of his time and money, and made himself a powerful 
factor for good and progress along all lines of activity. 

The late Jonathan Reece was born in Oxford county, Ontario. May i, 
1 83 1, so that he was a month past his seventy-third birthday when death 
called him to lay down his duties. Spending his early life in Oxford county, 
where he was educated in the public schools and spent the vacation periods 
in working on his father's farm, he was nearly grown when he left home to 



500 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

seek for himself a place in the world's affairs. After spending a short time 
in the state of Michigan, in 185 1 he went to California, where he was em- 
ployed in various occupations for seven years. He came up to British Colum- 
bia in 1858 and went to the mining regions of the Cariboo, but shortage of 
provisions soon compelled him to leave this district, and he came to the more 
settled parts of the province, although the entire country was just then be- 
ginning to develop and he was among the pioneers of the province. He 
worked in a sawmill in Yale for a time, and then went into the butcher busi- 
ness. In the year 1869 he came to Chilliwack, and to him belongs the honor 
of taking up the first pre-emption at this place. He purchased land from 
other parties, and during his life time came into possession of large amounts 
of land. He was one of the best known and most highly respected men in 
his community, successful and progressive in all departments of his activity. 
In politics he was a Liberal. 

Mr. Reece was married in 1866 to Miss Lucinda Lewis, a daughter of 
Edwin Lewis, of Oxford county, Ontario. The five children of this union 
are Willena, wife of Jonathan Galloway, of Chilliwack; Bertha, wife of 
George Marshall, of Chilliwack; Flora, wife of James Ballamy, of Chilli- 
wack; and Edwin and Elenora. Mrs. Reece is a member of the pioneer 
society of Chilliwack, being the third white woman settler in this district, 
coming in 1866. She has witnessed many important changes in the growth 
and development of the country. She takes an active part in church affairs, 
and is a mefnber of the Methodist congregation. 

WILLIAM GRANT GAUNCE. 

The rapid development of the great northwest has furnished excellent 
fields of labor wherein the activity of men of energy, ambition and discrimi- 
nation have proven resultant factors in winning prosperity. William Grant 
Gaunce, who is engaged in the real estate and mining brokerage business in 
Greenwood, came to this place in 1898. He was born in Carsonville, Kings 
county. New Brunswick, August 5, 1850, his parents being Christopher G." 
and Esther (Cook) Gaunce, both of whom are deceased. He was educated 
in the public schools of his native city, in Superior school in Millstream and 
in the University of New Brunswick, completing a course by graduation in 
the last named institution with the class of 1873, winning the Douglas gold 
medal in his last year over a large number of competitors. For a number 
of years he was identified with educational work, following the profession 
of teaching in the city and high schools of New Brunswick for six years, 
while for five years he was inspector of schools. In 1884 he was sent to 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 501 

England in behalf of emigration and following his return to his native land 
he was for three years superintendent of agencies for the Confederation 
Life Insurance Company for New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. 
In 1889 he went to the state of Washington, where he remained for four 
years, or until 1893. In 1896-7 he conducted the immigration bureau of 
the state of Washington and in 1898 he came to Greenwood, where he has 
since made his home. Here he embarked in the real estate and mining 
brokerage business, in which he has since been engaged, and during the six 
years of his connection with this city he has secured a large clientage. Many 
important real estate transfers have been promoted through his efforts and 
he has handled much valuable mining stock. 

In community afifairs Mr. Gaunce has taken a very active and helpful 
part, withholding his co-operation from no measure which he believes will 
contribute to general progress and improvement. He has been secretary of 
the board of trade of Greenw^ood almost continuously since its organization 
and he was a member of the commission which settled the coal strike at 
Fernie, British Columbia, in March, 1903. 

In 1875 Mr. Gaunce was happily married to Miss Eliza J. Atherton, of 
Frederickton, New Brunswick, and they have two children, Harold S. and 
A. Helen. Mr. Gaunce belongs to the Ancient Order of United Workmen 
and is a Conservative in ix&gt;litics, while in his religious belief he is a Con- 
gregationalists. The field of business is limitless, its opportunities are many, 
and yet comparatively few who enter the world's broad field of battle come 
off victors in the struggle for success and prominence. This is usually due 
to one or more of various causes — superficial preparation, lack of close 
application or an unwise choice in selecting an avocation for which one is 
fitted. The reverse of all these has entered into the success and prominence 
which Mr. Gaunce has attained in the business circles of Greenwood, where 
he now has a wide and favorable acquaintance. 

SAMUEL STEWART FOWLER. 

Samiuel Stewart Fowler, one of the foremost mining engineers of British 
Columbia, a resident of the city of Nelson, and active in the management 
and development of several of the most important mining, power and indus- 
trial enterprises of this section of the province, was born in New York city 
in i860. His parents were Azro and Louisa (Abbott) Fowler, of well 
known and long established New England ancestry. 

Mr. Fowler received the highest educational advantages offered in the 
eastern metropolis. He graduated from a Jil^eral arts course in 1881 with 



502 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the degree of A, B., and in 1884 graduated from the Columbia University 
School of Mines with the degree of E. M. From 1884 to 1886 he was em- 
ployed as a civil engineer in New York. In May, 1886, he went to the Black 
Hills of South Dakota, and filled positions in mining, smelting and milling 
concerns. In January, 1888, he was called to El Paso, Texas, and there 
built and operated a smelting plant. In the fall of 1888 he became assistant 
superintendent of the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mines of Idaho. In the 
summer of 1889 he arrived in British Columbia, this being a preliminary 
trip with reference to the building of a smelter for western capital. In 1890 
he built, at Golden, one of the first smelters in the province. From 1891 
to 1896 he was mining engineer for several British syndicates and at the 
same time prospected in different portions of the province. 

In the spring of 1896 Mr. Fowler became engineer for the London and 
British Columbia Gold Fields Company, a finance and development syndi- 
cate, which organized the Ymir Gold Mines, Limited, the Whitewater Gold 
Mines, Limited, and the Enterprise British Columbia Mines, Limited. This 
company took over the property of the Cascade Water Power and Light 
Company, and equipped and utilized the power of the falls of the Kettle 
river at Cascade City, the plant now supplying power to the surrounding 
districts. Since the death of J. Roderick Robertson Mr. Fowler has assumed 
the management of the company's interests, and has lent his energies and 
ability without reserve to the upbuilding of the industrial affairs of this 
section of the province. 

Although an eminently practical and exceedingly busy engineer, Mr. 
Fowler gives much attention to all branches of his profession and is a mem- 
ber of various organizations connected with this line of activity. He has 
membership with the American Institute of Mining Engineers, with the In- 
stitute of Mining and Metallurgy of London, is past president of the Cana- 
dian Mining Institute, and a member of the Franklin Institute of Phila- 
delphia. 

Mr. Fowler was married in 1902 to Miss Frances Hedley, a daughter 
of the late William Hedley of Halifax. 

JOHN HOUSTON. 

John Houston is editor and publisher of the Nelson Tribune, which 
he founded in 1892, and he has a place among the newspaper men of British 
Columbia. He has not only held up the mirror to public events and through 
his editorial columns lent his influence for public advancement, but as a citi- 




^^^6.^^^^^^JL^ ivt^^tZ^^ 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 503 

zen has himself taken an active part in affairs and in various official relations 
has served his city and province. 

Born in 1850, on a farm in Caledon township, Peel county, Ontario, 
a son of William and Mai-y (Thomas) Houston, his father a native Scotch- 
man and his mother born in Canada, he began his education in the public 
schools of Caledon, but left school when fourteen years old and has since 
relied on his ix&gt;wers of observation for an acquaintance with the affairs of 
the world. On leaving school he went to Chicago, and became an appren- 
tice to the printer's trade, in 1865, having been identified with that line of 
business for practically forty years. He came to British Columbia in 1888, 
and has since been identified with the affairs of the Kootenay district. He 
established the Donald Truth in 1888, and in 1890 the Nelson Miner, and in 
1892 the Nelson Tribune, of which he is the editor and manager. He also 
established the Rossland Miner in 1895. 

Mr. Houston was elected mayor of Nelson in 1897, 1898, 1900 and 
1905, giving the city a most efficient administration of its affairs. He 
was elected to the provincial legislature in 1900, and was re-elected in 1903. 
He is affiliated with the Fraternal Order of Eagles, and is not affiliated with 
any other order, society or church. He is married, his wife, Edith May 
Keeley, iDeing a native of York county, Ontario. 

SAMUEL DRAKE. 

Samuel Drake, for the past twenty years associated with the responsible 
office of jailer and sheriff of Nanaimo, is one of the British Columbia pio- 
neers, and the forty odd years spent in this province have been varied in ac- 
tivity and results, but have culminated in universal respect and esteem among 
his fellowmen and a gratifying degree of material prosperity. During the 
early days he was connected with half a dozen different enterprises in this 
new northwest country, and, while not universally successful, his energy and 
resolution never flagged and his career as a whole has been unusually suc- 
cessful and useful. 

Born in Devonshire, England, June 18, 1838, his parents, Samuel and 
Maria (Richards) Drake, being long since deceased, he was reared in one 
of the most noted mining regions of old England, and naturally his first and 
very early occupation was working in the copper mines of Devonshire. When 
twenty years old he came to a field of broader and better opportunities in the 
new world, and worked for a time in the old Cliff copper mine in the state 
of Michigan. In 1861 he went to California and worked six months in 
the quicksilver mines, and in the spring of 1862 joined the rush to the Eraser 



504 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

river in British Columbia, In that early year in the history of the province 
he landed at the then new and straggling town of Victoria. He then went 
as foreman of a copper mine at Sooke, on Vancouver Island, next went to 
the Cariboo region and got as far as Douglas portage. In that vicinity he 
worked on the Trutch contract from Chapman's Bar to Boston Bar, and dur- 
ing the summer was foreman of road construction. He spent the winter 
seasons of 1862 and 1863 in Victoria, and finished his contract during the 
open months. In the spring of 1864 he went to Cariboo and became fore- 
man of a copper mine. He later bought into what was known as the Watson 
claim on Williams creek, and directed his energies to the working of that for 
three years, but in the end the company became involved in a lawsuit and 
lost the claim in the court of equity. Following that unfortunate outcome 
he worked for wages and also prospected on Wilson creek and other places. 
In the fall of 1872 he arrived in Nanaimo, and his interests have been al- 
most permanently centered at this place ever since. He worked in the 
Douglas pit until 1874, and during that year he put in nine months and in 
1875 eight months in work at Cassiar, after which he returned to Nanaimo 
and began working in the coal mines. In 1878 he was appointed guard of 
convicts, and in 1885 was advanced to the position of assistant jailer and 
assistant sheriff, and somewhat later was appointed jailer and sheriff and 
has held the office to the present time, always serving with marked efficiency 
and giving an administration of unusual satisfaction in this very difficult and 
responsible office. 

Mr. Drake was happily married in Nanaimo on Christmas eve of 1873, 
and eleven children have been bom to himself and wife, two of them being 
deceased. Maria is the wife of Edward Devlin, of Nanaimo; Rhoda La- 
vina is deceased ; Rhoda is the wife of Alex Forester ; Mary ; Elizabeth is the 
wife of Robert Vipond; and the others are Annie, Ella, Samuel, Jr., Francis,

JEFFERY HAMMAR. 

Jeffery Hammar, who is filling the position of mayor of Grand Forks 
for the second term, and is one of the prominent and influential residents of 
that city, wielding a wide influence in public thought and action, was born in 
Sweden, August 8, 1865. He was reared under the parental roof and pur- 
sued his education in the public schools in Stockholm, after which he learned 
the butcher's trade under his father. In 1883 he crossed the Atlantic to 
New York city and soon secured employment there. Later he was employed 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 505 

in different places in the United States and in 1897 he arrived in British 
Cohimbia, locating at Rossland. There he conducted a boardinghouse for 
a short time, when he removed across the line to Bossburg, Washington. 
Becoming identified with business interests there as a butcher, he conducted 
his market until 1897, when he started a market in Grand Forks. He re- 
mained proprietor of that business until he sold out and accepted the man- 
agement of the business established by P. Burns &amp; Company. He is suc- 
cessfully controlling this business enterprise, managing the market with a 
capability that shows that he has excellent knowledge of the trade and 
thoroughly understands the wishes of his patrons. 

In April, 1896, Mr. Hammar was united in marriage to Miss Kerstin 
Johnson, also a native of Sweden. They have two children.^ Mr. Hammar 
is a member of the I. O. O. F. and the Knights of Pythias, this year being 
elected to grand master at arms, and enjoys the confidence and high esteem 
of the members of these fraternities. 

Mr. Hammar, in the position of mayor, has the confidence of the alder- 
manic board and ratepayers, always exercising his official prerogatives in 
support of every measure calculated to foster the general good or advance 
the public prosperity of the city. 

JOHN AYTON GIBSON. 

John Ayton Gibson, the postmaster of Nelson, was born in Teeswater, 
county Bruce, Ontario, September 29, 1859, and is a son of Alexander and 
Agnes' (Hastie) Gibson. His father is deceased, while his mother is now 
living in London, Ontario. In the public schools of his native town John A. 
Gibson acquired his early education, which was afterward supplemented by 
study in a high school in Walkerton. His education completed, he accepted 
a clerkship in a general store in Teeswater and in 1881 he went to Manitoba, 
where he entered the service of a contracting firm. In 1884 he arrived in 
British Columbia, landing at Golden after walking the entire distance from 
Calgary. Hoping to rapidly realize wealth in the mining districts he began 
a search for gold, but like many others was unsuccessful, and returned to 
other business pursuits. In 1885 he opened a store and started pack trains to 
the Similkameen country, continuing thus until the trade fell off and busi- 
ness was at a standstill. He then returned to Winnipeg, but after remaining 
there for a year he again came to British Columbia, for he believed that its 
future was a bright one and that business conditions would develop, so 
that he might have better opportunities in the far west. For a year after 
his return he engaged in mining and then established a drug store in con- 



506 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

nection with W. F, Teetzel, conducting this enterprise until 1896, when 
he sold his interest. In that year he became manager of the Phair Hotel, 
which he conducted until 1902, when he was appointed postmaster of Nel- 
son, which position he yet occupies. He employs four clerks and through 
the holidays has extra service. The new postofhce building completed in 
1903 is the handsomest structure in the Kootenay country and in his admin- 
istration of the affairs of the office Mr. Gibson displays marked capability, 
executive force and fidelity to duty. He has always taken an active interest 
in political affairs, supporting the cause of the Liberal party. He is a mem- 
ber of the Presbyterian church and his interest in its work is sincere. Prog- 
ress and patriotism may well be termed the keynote of his character, for at 
all times he labors for advancement and has put forth effective and earnest 
effort in behalf of general improvement. He is enthusiastic in the subject 
of the future of the province and especially of the Kootenay country and is 
a worthy representative of that substantial class of citizens who uphold the 
social, political and moral status of the community. 

THOMAS KIRKPATRICK. 

Thomas Kirkpatrick, a prominent manufacturer of red cedar shingles 
with offices and mills at Hastings, British Columbia, and residence in Van- 
couver, has lived in the province since 1886. This was the year of the great 
fire and the year of the org^anization and naming of the city of Vancouver. 
With the business development he has since been closely identified and his 
efforts have been resultant factors in the promotion of its substantial g-rowth. 

A native of Nova Scotia, Mr. Kirkpatrick was born in Parrsboro, on 
the loth of December, 1864. His father, Alexander Kirkpatrick, who was 
of Irish lineage, became one of the early settlers of that section of Nova 
Scotia and was married there to Miss Eliza Mason, a native of that country. 
She died in the forty-fifth year of her age, but Mr. Kirkpatrick is still living 
in his eighty-sixth year. 

Mr. Kirkpatrick of this review is the only member of the family in 
British Columbia. He was educated in his native town and reared upon his 
father's farm. In 1886, when nineteen years of age, he went to Boston 
and two years later came to British Columbia, where he accepted a position 
in a shingle mill under George Slater, being paid thirty dollars per month. 
He continued to work in that mill for two years and then, desiring to benefit 
more directly by his own labors, he entered upon an independent business 
career by renting a small mill at Port Moody. This he operated for two 
years with varying success, thus gaining a good start in the business world

BRITISH COLUMBIA 507 

In 1890 Mr. Kirkpatrick again started in the manufacture of shingles. 
He built a scow on which he erected a shingle mill, and operated it for two 
years on False creek. He then purchased a site at Cedar Cove, and moved 
his mill to that location from False creek. In 1900 he purchased the Archi- 
bald McNair mill at Hastings, which he still owns. In 1902, the mill at 
Cedar Cove having been destroyed by fire^ he purchased the Welsh mill at 
New Westminster, and built another mill at Hastings. In 1904 he lost 
the mill at New Westminster, also by fire, and, having no insurance, his loss 
was about $15,000. His annual output of shingles is now about sixty million 
of common dimensions and he finds a ready sale in Ontario and throughout 
the northw^est. His business reputation is unassailable, for he is strictly fair 
and honorable in his dealings and his enterprise and laudable ambition have 
formed an excellent foundation upon which he has built his success. 

On the 1 8th of September, 1890, Mr. Kirkpatrick was united in mar" 
riage to Miss Elizabeth Brander, a native of Halifax and of Scotch descent, 
her father being Robert Brander of Halifax. This union has been blessed 
with two sons, Earl Alexander and Robert Huntley, both born in Vancouver 
and now attending school. 

Mr. Kirkpatrick and his wife occupy a pleasant cottage home, about 
two miles from his mills. His attention is largely given to his business 
operations and he is now running his plant with a full quota of men, operat- 
ing the mill to its full capacity. As his financial resources have increased 
he has invested in city property, which is continually growing in value, and 
his life record stands in evidence of the fact that success is not a matter of 
genius but is the outcome of clear judgment and experience. 

ISAAC KIPP. 

Isaac Kipp, of Chilliwack, is the longest established citizen of the Chilli- 
wack valley, and took a very prominent part in the formation of the town, 
which was located on land that he took up over forty years ago. Per- 
severing industry has been the dominant trait of his character and the prin- 
cipal ground of his success. He began his career in this country without 
capital or backing, and has steadily continued his work until he is now one 
of the most successful and widely known men of the Chilliwack valley. 

Born in Brant county. West Ontario, November 10, 1840, his parents, 
Benjamin and Elizabeth (Force) Kipp, being both deceased, Mr. Kipp got 
his early schooling in a backwoods school, and most of his youth was de- 
voted to the work of his father's farm. He remained at home and was his 
father's assistant until 1859. On November 3 of that year, when he was a 



608 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

vigorous and ambitious young fellow of nineteen years, he sailed from New 
York and by way of the isthmus arrived in the golden state of California. 
Here he employed himself in mining for three years, in the vicinity of Forest 
City and Downieville. In 1862 he was among those attracted to the Cari- 
boo district of British Columbia, and to his destination he packed his sup- 
plies on his back from Yale, a total distance of four hundred and fifty miles. 
Mining did not prove a successful venture with him, and he therefore stayed 
in the mining region but one summer. This brought him to the Chilliwack 
valley in the fall of 1862, and here he has worked out his successful career 
during the subsequent years. During the first winter he was entirely alone 
in the valley, this beautiful agricultural region then being in a state of nature 
untouched by man." As there was no' recorder he could not get his pre- 
emption officially recorded, and he therefore sent his claims to England and 
received his deeds from there. He took up four hundred and eighty acres 
of land where the town of Chilliwack now stands. This tract was then cov- 
ered with hazel brush, which he laboriously cleared off, and at length put 
his land into an arable state. He was in debt when he started, but he per- 
severed through all discouragements that beset him and is today one of the 
most successful men of his locality. In the spring of 1904 he sold three 
hundred and sixty-five acres of his land, and still retains a hundred acres 
adjoining the town. It was Mr. Kipp who established the Excelsior mill in 
Chilliwack, but he later made. a present of a two-thirds interest of the plant 
to his son and a son-in-law. 

Mr. Kipp was married in 1865 to Miss Mary Ann Nelems, a daughter 
of William Nelems, of England, who in 1832 came to Canada and was one 
of the earliest pioneers of Oxford county, Ontario. There were ten children 
born to this union, namely : Mary Jane, wife of William Knight, of Chilli- 
wack; Gertrude, wife of Edwin Wells, of Chilliwack; Ellen, wife of William 
Atkinson, of Vancouver; Alma, wife of Ed Chadsey, of Chilliwack; Edwin, 
William, Arthur, Frank, Fred, and Albert, deceased. There are also twenty- 
four grandchildren. Mr. Kipp is a Liberal in politics, and for two years 
served as councilman of Chilliwack. 

Mrs. Kipp was the first white woman settler in the Chilliwack valley, 
she having left her home in Ontario in 1865, coming direct via New York, 
the isthmus route and San Francisco, the trip taking thirty days from New 
York to Victoria. Their daughter, Mrs. William Knight, was the first 
white child born in the district. They are both members of the pioneer so- 
ciety of Chilliwack. They both take an active part in church work and at- 
tend the Methodist congregation.

HIS HONOUR JUDGE HARRISON. 

Judge Eli Harrison, who has attained a distinguished position in a pro- 
fession where advancement depends upon individual merit and now serving 
as judge for the county of Nanaimo in the province of British Columbia, 
was lx&gt;rn in England and was educated in the collegiate school, the vener- 
able Archdeacon Wood being his preceptor. He prepared for the bar as 
a law student in the ofifice and under the direction of George W. Pearkes, 
an eminent Canadian and American lawyer. He also studied with Robert 
Bishop and pursued his reading for a time in the office of the attorney gen- 
eral of British Columbia. Judge Harrison came to British Columbia in 1858 
with his father, Eli Harrison, Esquire, who had crossed the plains at an 
early epoch in the development of the Pacific coast country and he traversed 
the whole of western America. He married Miss Elizabeth Warburton and 
both are still living, the father having attained to the advanced age of eighty 
years. He and his wife are communicants of the Church of England. 

Judge Harrison, after careful preparation for the bar, entered upon the 
practice of law. He further added to his knowledge by serving as law clerk 
in the provincial legislature and as clerk of the house and he conducted much 
of the criminal business of the province as Crown prosecutor. He was acting 
registrar of titles for the province and his official service has always been in 
the line of his profession. After practicing law for a time Judge Har- 
rison was appointed notary public, commissioner for taking affidavits in the 
supreme court, justice of the peace for the province, and stipendiary magis- 
trate and county court judge of the Cariboo district. Subsequently he served 
as judge of the Nanaimo district and also as local judge of the supreme 
court with all the powers of a supreme court judge in the Nanaimo judicial 
district. He is also the judge of the court of revision under the assessment 
acts of Vancouver Island. 

In 1880 Judge Harrison was married to Miss Eunice M. L. Seabrook, 
a native of Canada, and they became the parents of six children, all born 
in British Columbia, namely : Paul Phillips, a law student ; Eunice Bagster ; 
Victor Birch, a law student; Claude L., who is also studying law; Bernice, 
who is attending All Hallows Yale; and Herschel Roads, who is attendmg 
school in Victoria. The judge and his family adhere to the faith of the 
Church of England and he has attained to the thirty-second degree in Ma- 
sonry. He is a past grand secretary of the Grand lodge of the province and 
is the representative of the Grand lodges of England, New Hampshire and 
Manitoba, while his father is a past grand master of the Grand lodge of 



510 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

British Colnmbia. Hi? real life work, however, has been the practice of 
law. His decisions indicate strong- mentality, careful analysis, a thorough 
knowledg-e of law and an unbiased judgment. The judge on the bench 
fails more frequently, perhaps, from a deficiency in that broad-mindedness 
which not only comprehends the details of a situation quickly and that in- 
sures a complete self-control under even the most exasperating- conditions 
than from any other cause ; and the judge who makes a success in the dis- 
charg-e of his multitudinous delicate duties is a man of well-rounded char- 
acter, finely-balanced mind and of splendid intellectual attainments. That 
Judge Harrison is regarded as such a jurist is a uniformly accepted fact. 

BARTLEY W. SHILES. 

Bartley W. Shiles, prominent in the public affairs of Westminster, now 
serving as one of its aldermen, while formerly he was mayor of the city, 
is a native of Delaware, his birth having occurred in Seaford, on the 13th 
of August, 1839. He conies of English ancestry and was educated in his 
native state. After the outbreak of the Civil war he joined the Union navy 
and was on the vessel Farragut on the Mississippi river, assisting in the 
blockading at Wilmington and at the capture of Fort Fisher. He served 
throughout the war and was engaged in marine service afterward until 1871, 
when, attracted by business possibilities which he believed to exist in British 
Columbia, he made his way to the northwest, locating at New Westminster. 
Thus he has contributed in large measure toward its substantial improvement 
and at the same time has promoted his individual prosperity. 

While residing in the United States Mr. Shiles gave his political allegi- 
ance to the Democratic party, and on removing to British Columbia he 
joined the Liberal party, taking an active interest in the political questions 
and issues of the day. He was elected a member of the city council and 
served in that capacity for twenty years. He was then elected mayor and 
filled that important office from 1895 until 1897, inclusive. In 1896, while 
serving as chief executive of New Westminster, the council was composed 
of ten members and at a meeting in which six, constituting a quorum, were 
present a vote was cast concerning the building of a bridge across the 
Eraser river at New Westminster, to cost four hundred and sixty thousand 
dollars. Five of the councilmen voted in the affiniiative, while one voted 
against the measure. Mayor Shiles being convinced that the city could not 
afford the building of a bridge and also believing that a substantial structure 
such as would be required could not be built for that money accordingly 
acted upon his firm convictions and vetoed the bill as it came from the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 511 

council to him. This caused a great deal of excitement in the town, for the 
bridge was much needed and an indignation meeting was then called to 
ascertain his action, but at a full meeting of the city council he gave his 
re£:Sons and his action was sustained. The result has vindicated the course 
v^hich he pursued and the city now has a fine steel bridge, which was built 
by the province at a cost of a million dollars and which cost the city not 
a cent. While many of the citizens at first severely criticized him for his 
action he was later commended by them as time proved that he had acted 
v.'isely in this matter. 

In 1867 Mr. Shiles was married to Miss Eliza A. Insley, their mar- 
riage being celebrated in Delaware, and their eldest son, Delaware A., was 
born in that state. In 1871 Mrs. Shiles and their son came to New West- 
iiiinster, joining the husband and father here, and the son is now traffic 
manager on the British Columbia electric railroad. The next child, Charles 
E., is in the custom service in Ottawa. Mrs. Shiles died in 1902 and 
her death was deeply regretted by many friends. She had been a devoted 
wife and mother and she and her husband had lived together in a happy 
married relation for thirty-five years. Mr. Shiles has built a nice home in 
New Westminster, where he resides with his son, Delaware A. He has 
been a valued member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows for the 
past forty-four years and is past grand master of the grand lodge of British 
Columbia, having served as the chief officer of the order in the province in 
1881. He has represented the grand lodge in the Sovereign grand lodge in 
St. Louis in 1891 and also at Portland, Oregon, in 1892. He is a member 
of the Royal Templars and has been an active member of the Methodist 
church for thirty-eight years, serving in some of its offices and taking a most 
active and helpful part in its work. Since coming to the province he has 
been continuously connected with its public affairs and his course has been 
an honor to the city that has honored him. 

JOHN GRAHAM. 

John Graham, numbered among Victoria's pioneer settlers, dating his 
residence here from April, 1859, is a native of Scotland, his birth having 
occurred in the city of Perth, on the 28th of December, 1826. His ancestors 
had long resided in that country and his father was a contractor and builder 
of Perth. His mother, who bore the maiden name of Elizabeth Finlay, 
\\a3 a daughter of George Finlay, who was for forty-three years an elder 
m the Presbyterian church and a very prominent, influential and highly 
respected citizen of his community. 



612 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

John Graham lost his mother when only two years of age. He ac- 
quired his education in the city of his nativity and entered upon his business 
career in a solicitor's office in Perth. Later he went to Glasgow and secured 
a position in the treasurer's office of the Clyde. Later he went to England, 
where he had charge of the office of a wine merchant, and on leaving Great 
Britain he made his way to British Columbia, bearing with him letters of 
recommendation, which he presented to Sir James Douglas. He was at 
once appointed to fill a vacancy in the treasury, and in 1867, when the island 
and the mainland were united in one province, Mr. Graham was in charge 
of the treasury. A savings bank act was passed by the legislature about 
that time and he received from the executive council a mandate to establish 
the bank with head office in Victoria and four branches, one each at Nanai- 
mo, New Westminster, Yale and Cariboo. The bank was under the super- 
vision of commissioners, and Mr. Roscoe and Alfred J. Langley were ap- 
pointed to serve as commissioners, their labor in this regard being entirely 
gratuitous. The head office of the bank was in the treasury, but to accom- 
modate the working classes an office was opened in Government street, being 
opened for two hours on two days in the week. When confederation was 
consummated Mr. Graham was transferred to the Dominion government as 
assistant receiver-general for British Columbia. He occupied that position 
until he retired from the service in 1890. Throughout his entire business 
career he was recognized as the soul of honor and integrity in all business 
transactions and the trust reposed in him was never betrayed in the slightest 
degree. 

On the 15th of October, 1884, Mr. Graham was united in marriage to 
Miss Isabella Aitken, a daughter of Walter Aitken, of Stirlingshire, Scot- 
land, and they have a delightful home at No. 88 Simcoe street. The grounds 
covering two acres are adorned with beautiful flowers of their own .planting 
and statuary placed among the trees also adds to the appearance of the place. 
Choice pictures and other works of art adorn the home, which in its fur- 
nishings indicates the artistic and cultured taste of the owner. Not far from 
his home Mr. Graham has erected three good .residences, which he rents, 
and these, too, are surrounded with beautiful grounds. Both Mr. and Mrs. 
Graham are adherents of the faith of the Church of Scotland and they are 
prominent socially, having a wide acquaintance in Victoria, the hospitality 
of manv of the best homes of the citv being: extended to them.

DONALD McGILLIVRAY. 

Donald McGillivray, an esteemed resident of Chilliwack, is a pioneer 
citizen, business man and rancher of New Westminster district, and during 
something more than forty years of varied activity he has gained a broad 
success in material affairs and won an honored place among his fellow men 
by reason of his invincible integrity and equitable dealings in business and 
private relations. 

Born in Glengary county, Ontario, December 2, 1838, a son of John 
and Catherine (Urquhart) McGillivray, both of whom are now deceased, 
he obtained most of his preliminary education in the public schools of Glen- 
gary county, and, when at the age of thirteen the family residence was trans- 
ferred to New York state, he gained practical experience in farming and 
in honest industry during the remaining years of his boyhood spent in that 
state. He lived on the home place in New York state until he came to Brit- 
ish Columbia in i860. Going to the Puget Sound he was in the employ of 
the Puget Mill company at Port Gamble for a time. He was attracted to 
the CarilxDo district by the mining excitement of 1862, but was taken sick 
on reaching there, and after remaining two months he sold his outfit and 
spent the following winter at Port Townsend. Next year he started to 
operate a pack train to the Cariboo region, and was engaged in packing for 
four years. He then sold his outfit to the Western Union Telegraph Com- 
pany, and engaged wath that company in line building. When this work 
was completed he located on Sumas prairie and started the farming, dairy- 
ing and stock-raising enterprises in which he so successfully engaged until 
1903. During eight years of that period he was in the general merchandise 
business in Chilliwack. In 1903 he moved to his present beautiful home 
place at Chilliwack, where he has a comfortable residence, surrounded by 
fruit trees, garden and all the comforts which add to the pleasure of his 
quiet retirement from the active affairs of the world, in which he has en- 
gaged a full measure of his strength and ability. 

Mr. McGillivray has been a leader in public affairs from the time of 
his first settlement in this province. He was the first magistrate and justice 
of the peace in New Westminster district, having been appointed in 1872, 
and still holding the office. In 1878 he was returned as a member of par- 
liament tor the New Westminster riding, and served one term in looking 
after the interests of the British Columbian constituency. His politics are 
Conservative, and in religion he is a Methodist. He affiliates with Ionic 
Lodge No. 19, A. F. &amp; A. M. 



614 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

By his first marriage, in 1868, to Miss Susan Hall, a daughter of Ser- 
geant William Hall, of Chilliwack, Mr. McGillivray has six children, namely : 
Catherine N., wife of Rev. Allan Sharpe, of Trout Lake, British Columbia; 
William H. ; John Wesley; Hattie, wife of Thomas Oliver, of Victoria; 
Alice, wife of Henry Collinson, of Sumas; and Donald. In November, 
188 1, Mr. McGillivray was married to Julia Andrews, a daughter of Rich- 
ard B. Andrews, of Victoria. This union has been blessed with five chil- 
dren: Helen, Marion, Norman Andrews, Jessie Hope, deceased, and Mar- 
jorie. 

LUKE PITHER. 

Luke Pither is one of Victoria's most successful and most progressive 
wholesale business m.en, and he has been identified with the interests of 
this city for a quarter of a century, during which period he has not only 
attained his own individual success but also in many ways made his efforts 
count for the permanent improvement and welfare of Victoria. 

Mr. Pither was born in Leroy, New York, June 7, 1856, being of Eng- 
lish lineage. He received his early education in his native town, but was 
reared on a farm and his earliest occupation was stock-raising. He came 
out to Victoria in 1879, and it was his intention tO' continue the stock indus- 
try in this part of the country, but he was diverted from this plan, and for 
some five years was employed as an accountant. He then took charge of the 
Occidental Hotel and during his three years' management made a great 
success of the venture and gained a reputation for conducting the hostelry 
in most approved manner. For two years he was also connected with the 
Colonial Hotel at New Westminster. He then sold out to embark in his 
present business. The firm was originally Boucherat &amp; Company, and Mr. 
Pither bought out the senior member, and after a time the other member, 
Mr. Coigdaripe, sold his interest to Mr. Max Leiser, who is Mr. Pither's 
present partner. The business was at first conducted on a small scale, but 
they have become extensive importers of wines and liquors and cigars. They 
have a large and well stocked store and offices, and they are the only exclu- 
sive wholesale wine and liquor dealers in the province. The firm owns a 
large brick block, with ninety feet front on Yates street, and tlie building 
extending back one hundred and twenty feet deep. Their establishment 
fills the entire length and twenty-two feet of the front, and the house will 
compare with almost any business of its kind in the northwest. Mr. Pither 
give? his entire attention to this business, and it is largely owing to his fine 



• BRITISH COLUMBIA 515 

business principles and ability as an organizer that the trade has been so 
thoroughly established and built up to its present prosperous proportions. 

In 1883 Mr. Pither married Miss Maggie Thomson, of Rochester, New 
York. She is of Scotch ancestry. Mrs. Pither is a member of the Presby- 
terian church; Mr. Pither also attends services there. He is an active mem- 
ber of the board of trade, being a member of the council and on the com- 
mittee on railways. He gives much of his thought and is always willing 
to direct his energies to the upbuilding of the city of his choice, whose pros- 
perity and growth have been largely effected by such public-spirited men as 
Mr. Pither. 

GEORGE LITTELL SCHETKY. 

George Littell Schetky, prominent in business, social and public affairs 
at Nanaimo, has lived in British Columbia about twenty years, and during 
a varied business experience, in which he has met both adversity and pros- 
perity, he has advanced to a position of influence among his associates. 

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, June 10, 1867, a son of Rev. 
George P. and Eliza Burr (Oliphant) Schetky, his father being deceased 
and his mother living in New Jersey, he was taken, at the age of eighteen 
months, first to Marshall, Michigan, and then to Bay City and Paw Paw, 
in the same state. In Paw Paw he attended public school, and at the age of 
fifteen returned to his native city of Philadelphia and entered a bank. After 
eighteen months of banking experience he made preparations to enter college 
and obtain an advanced education. This intention was indefinitely deferred 
by his hearing of British Columbia and its magtnificent resources, and in 
1885 he arrived in this province, where he has since centered his principal 
efforts. In 1886 he started a drygoods and clothing business in Vancouver, 
but this was burned out by the fire of June 13. 1886, but he resumed business 
at once. A little later he bought a business in New Westminster and moved 
to that place in 1887, where in February, 1891, he was again visited by fire. 
He continued in business at New Westminster until 1895, ^'^^^ then came 
to Nanaimo and established the real estate and financial agency which he 
has since directed along most prosperous lines. He is also secretary-treasurer 
of the Nanaimo Fisheries, Limited, and is secretary of the board of trade. 
He is president of the Nanaimo Yacht Club. He is still a loyal citizen of 
the United States, and a stanch member of the Republican party. On Janu- 
ary 15, 1898, he was appointed consular agent at Nanaimo by President 
McKinley, and he still holds this office. He is a member of the Protestant 
Episcopal church. 



516 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

August 12, 1892, Mr. Schetky was married to Miss Ellen Katherine 
Cross, a daughter of John Hyde Cross and Eliza Cross, of England. They 
have four children, George Bernard, Lionel Hugh Freeman, Gerald Law- 
rence and John Littell. 

CLARENCE MELVILLE AVERILL. 

Clarence Melville Averill is manager of the New Westminster Creamery 
Society, one of the largest butter-making establishments in the northwest, 
and the extension of its business over a wide territory so that the demand 
for its products taxes all the capacity of output and the continued high 
standard of its business methods and commodities are in no small measure 
due to the enterprising management and direction of Mr. Averill, who 
has occupied his present position for the past five years, and is recognized 
as one of the foremost dairymen and creamery operators in British Co- 
lumbia. 

Mr. Averill is a native of the States, having been born in Washington 
county, Maine, m 1853. His parents, Warren and Emily (Elsmore) Averill, 
were also born in the Pine Tree state, of old colonial families. The parents 
brought their home and family to the Pacific coast in 1863, and their abode 
has since been mainly in the state of California. The father, an enterprising 
farmer, is now operating in the famous Palouse country of Washington. 

The public school system of California furnished Mr. Averill his edu- 
cational opportunities, and he spent his early years on his father's farm, 
where he got his first training in the dairy business. From 1894 to 1899 
he was in the creamery business in Humboldt county, California, and in 
the latter year he came to British Columbia and accepted the management 
of the New Westminster Creamery Society. This company, carrying on 
one of the largest industries in the Eraser river valley, has an annual aggre- 
gate output of one hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of finest grade 
butter — indeed, none better can be found in the old established creameries 
of the east. They supply not only the local market but also ship large quan- 
tities to the Yukon region. The business has grown very rapidly in the last 
few years, and during his management Mr. Averill has introduced many 
improved methods in the manufacture. 

Mr. Averill was married in 1871 to Miss Elizabeth Lovell, a native of 
Sonoma county, California. Her father, James Lovell, was a pioneer of that 
county. Four children have been born to this marriage, namely: Augustus; 
Ivy,, wife of T. J. Crawford, in California ; and Raymond and Alice. Fra- 
ternally Mr. Averill affiliates with the Masons and the Odd Fellows.

WILLIAM JOHNSTON. 

William Johnston, by whose death on June i6, 1894, the city of New 
Westminster lost one of her most valuable and highly esteemed citizens, 
was for over thirty years connected with the shoe business in this city, but 
was best known for his rugged honesty, his sterling manhood, his genial per- 
sonality, which attracted men irresistibly to him, and a noble character and 
good name, which remain as his greatest gift to his children and which will 
bear respect and esteem while his memory lasts in the city. 

Born in Ireland in 1832, of Irish ancestry and parentage, educated in 
his native country, where he becam.e an adept at the shoemaker's trade, he 
arrived, in 1859, in the province of British Columbia, and from that time 
until his death, covering a period of thirty-five years, he was prominently 
and closely identified with the best interests of New Westminster. Shortly 
after his arrival he was married in the Holy Trinity Episcopal church to 
Miss Bessie Burr, also a native of Ireland. He opened a shoe shop in the 
then new town, and plied his trade industriously and successfully for the 
sup}X)rt of himself and family. He became almost immediately a popular 
character among his fellow townsmen, and all the prominent citizens of 
that period were wont to gather in his shop and discuss the leading events 
and questions current among them. From this circumstance his shop be- 
came widely known as the " leather parliament," and it can never b€ told 
with exactness how many policies and theories, shaped and forged in the 
white heat of that shoe-shop discussion, later became important civic and 
political custom and law in the province, but certain it is that the influence 
and spirit of those assemblages were deviating and a determining factor of 
progress in sentiment and action. 

But at the same time honesty, diligence and good workmanship were 
giving excellent satisfaction to all the business patrons of that shop, and 
the trade grew with the growth of the city and gave Mr. Johnston much 
prestige in business circles. In 1890 he opened his New Westminster shoe 
store, which was located just across the street from the fine store now con- 
ducted by his sons. His business, begun along small lines, had increased to 
large proportions before his death, and since, in the hands of his energetic 
sons, has enjoyed added and continuous prosperity. In 1898 the great fire 
wiped out the establishment and entailed a large loss despite the insurance. 
But business was continued almost immediately in a temporar}^ building. 

Mr. Johnston took great interest in politics, and at the solicitation of 
his fellow citizens he served as city alderman for some years, using his best 



518 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

efforts and best judgment in behalf of his city. He wielded much influence 
among' his fellow men, as was natural when one considers the strength and 
beneficence of his character, and it can be said that his personal popularity 
and his business prosperity were never employed except as means to worthy 
ends and the benefit of his family and community. At the time of his death 
he w-as serving as grand master of the grand lodge of Orangemen of the 
province, and many of the leading men of that order came from all over 
the province to pay the last tribute of respect to their departed brother, and 
the funeral was one of the most largely attended of any ever in the city. 
He was a charter member of the Reformed Episcopal church, of which he 
was one of the stanchest supporters and filled the office of rector's warden 
from the beginning. 

Mr. Johnston was not only a good citizen, but also a faithful and ex- 
emplary father and husband, and his family received his love and highest 
devotion, of which the members have indeed proved themselves worthy by 
their careers. His wife still lives in New Westminster, and they reared a 
fine family of sons and daughters, all of whom were natives of New West- 
minster. They have all grown to manhood and womanhood, and not one 
of them has in any way bedimmed the untarnished record of their revered 
father. The shoe store conducted by them in the home town is a large, 
well stocked, well managed establishment, one of the best in the city and 
a credit to the business activity of the province. They also have a large 
store in the city of Vancouver, which has been conducted so successfully 
that it has the reputation and goes by the name of the " Big Shoe House." 

The sons and daughters are as follows: Mary Ann is the wife of 
Charles Warwick, who is an accountant in one of the largest stores in New 
Westminster. Bessie is the wife of W. S. Collester, who is a prominent 
dry-goods merchant of the city. John Joseph, the oldest son, is assistant 
in the assessor's and collector's office in New Westminster. Beckie is the 
wife of William Ix)ve, assistant manager in the store at Vancouver. Will- 
iam Burr is manager of the New Westminster store. George Benjamin is 
manager of the Vancouver store. Edwin Henry is now connected with the 
engineers engaged on the Alaska boundary survey. Alfred H. is an assist- 
ant in the New Westminster store. Edith L. is at home with her mother. 
The family have erected a splendid residence on the lot on which the children 
were all born, and the sons, who are unmarried, have their home with their 
good mother, who deserves the highest praise for the manner in which she 
has reared her children, and her place in the esteem of family and com- 
munity is secure for all time.

COLONEL RICHARD WOLFENDEN, L S. O., V. D. 

Colonel Richard Wolfenden, who has for many years had the honorable 
position of Queen's and King's printer for British Columbia and also con- 
troller of stationery for the province, is one of the most prominent of Vic- 
toria pioneers, and has followed the destiny of this city since its earliest 
history as a corporate town. 

He was born in Rathmel, Yorkshire, England, March 30, 1836, being 
of English ancestry and the third son of Robert and Mary (Frankland) 
Wolfenden, both natives of England. The parents were farmers and mem- 
bers of the Church of England. Colonel Wolfenden was educated in Lan- 
cashire and in Westmoreland, and became a member of the Royal Engineers 
in 1855. I" 1858 he was a member of a party of one hundred and fifty 
of the Royal Engineers which made the voyage around the Horn to British 
Columbia. There was no settlement on the mainland then, and Victoria 
bore small resemblance to the present thriving city, the old Hudson's Bay 
Company's fort then being the principal center of activity in the place. The 
object which brought the party out here was to do roadmaking, surveying, 
etc., and Colonel Wolfenden's position was at headquarters under Colonel 
Moody, who was in charge of the department. 

Upon his retirement from the Royal Engineers in 1863, he was ap- 
pointed Queen's printer for the province of British Columbia, and he has 
been the honorable and efficient incumbent of this office during all the sub- 
sequent forty odd years. He has also been prominent in many other public 
affairs. For two years he was a member of the city board of school trustees. 
He was one of the first to join the volunteer movement in British Columbia, 
and was ensign in the New Westminster and Victoria Rifle Volunteers from 
1864 to 1874; and in the latter year, when the organization merged with 
the Canada Militia he continued his connection with the latter, and in 1878 
retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel (V. D.) and was created I. S. O. 
in 1903. 

Colonel Wolfenden was married in 1865 to Miss Kate Cooley, of Ash- 
ford, England. They have had seven children, all born in this province, 
and all are living, as follows: Nellie, now the wife of George F. Mathews; 
Francis Cooley; Roberta Elizabeth, now Mrs. Charles P. Innes; Arthur 
Richard; Mabel Mary, the wife of Kenneth R. Stratfeild; Walter William; 
and Kate Cooley, the wife of Percy B. Fowler. The mother of these chil- 
dren died in 1878, and in 1879 Colonel Wolfenden married Miss Felicite C. 
Bayley, who was born in Philadelphia, but was of old English ancestry. 



520 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

The children of this marriage are Frederick Leslie, Victor Arnold and 
Madge, at home with their parents. The family adhere to the English church, 
the Colonel having been a warden of the church, and he is also president of 
the Yorkshire Society and a member of the Ancient Order of United Work- 
men. 

GEORGE ARTHUR RENDELL. 

In reviewing the history of George Arthur Rendell one is reminded 
of the words of a great New York financier. " If you're not a success don't 
blame the times you live in, don't blame the place you occupy, don't blame the 
circumstances you're surrounded with — lay the blame where it belongs, to 
yourself. Not in time, place or circumstance, but in the man lies success. 
If you want success you must pay the price." Realizing the truth of this, 
Mr. Rendell has paid the price of concentrated effort, of indefatigable en- 
^''gy&gt; of i&gt;erseverance and well applied business principles and has won the 
victory which he started out to win years ago. He was one of the pioneer 
merchants of Greenwood, where he is still engaged in commercial pursuits, 
dealing in drygoods and men's furnishings. 

A native of St. Johns, Newfoundland, born on the 17th of February, 
1861, Mr. Rendell is a son of George T. and Mary (Wood) Rendell, both 
of whom are living in St. Johns, Newfoundland, where the father is still 
engaged in mercantile pursuits, having for many years been closely asso- 
ciated with commercial interests there. His son, George Arthur Rendell, 
was a public school student in his early boyhood days and afterward sup- 
plemented his preliminary training by a course in the Church of England 
College. When he laid aside his text books he entered a commission house, 
in which he worked for a few years, after which he began farming in the 
vicinity of Guelph, where he continued for three years. In 1882 he returned 
to his native city and in that locality devoted his energies to agricultural 
pursuits for several years and was also a representative of commercial in- 
terests, there conducting mercantile enterprises. In 1892 he came to British 
Columbia, locating at Vernon, and in connection with an uncle he conducted 
a cattle ranch until the spring of 1894, when he came to Greenwood. 

Mr. Rendell established a store at Boundary Falls and conducted that 
tmtil the town of Greenwood was located, when he joined Robert Wood and 
Ralph Smailes in opening the first store in the embryo city. They secured 
a stock of general merchandise, and u^jon his removal to his present location 
he had built the building fifty by one hundred feet, three stories in height. 
As the years have gone by he has dropped other lines of merchandising and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 521 

now devotes his attention exclusively to dealing in drygoods and men's 
furnishings. He has a well selected stock carefully purchased with a view 
to the demands of a general public and his reasonable prices and straight- 
forward business dealing have secured to him a constantly growing pat 
ronage. 

In January, 1904, occurred the marriage of Mr. Rendell and Miss 
Marian Manahan, of Lanark, Ontario, and they have a pleasant home in 
Greenwood. They are members of the Church of England and he is a mem- 
ber of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. In his political view^s he is 
a Conservative, and he was alderman of Greenwood for one year, while for 
the past three years he has 1&gt;een justice of the peace. He has been strictly 
fair and impartial in his decisions in the justice court. In all public positions 
his duties have been discharged with conscientious obligation and with the 
utmost fidelity. 

BENJAMIN S. ODDY. 

Benjamin S. Oddy, a member of the firm of Swinerton Sz: Oddy, real 
estate, financial and insurance agents, is classed with the representative busi- 
ness men of Victoria and at the same time ranks with her leading and influ- 
ential citizens, being the champion of many measures that have proven of 
marked benefit. His deep interest in the city has been manifested in tangible 
way by his support of aldermanic measures that have contributed to general 
progress and substantial improvement. 

Mr. Oddy is a native of England, his birth having occurred in Brad- 
ford, Yorkshire, on the 28th of August, 1855. He is of English lineage, 
representing a family that for many generations has resided in the mother 
country. His father, John Charles Oddy. was an English merchant and 
manufacturer. The subject of this review is the only member of the family 
in British Columbia. He was educated in his native country and was there 
engaged in business with his father in the manufacture of drygoods and 
woolens, which they sold to the wholesale trade. Attracted by the business 
opportunities anji possibilities of the great and growing northwest Benjamin 
S. Oddy came to British Columbia and here turned his attention to real 
estate operations, both buying and selling on his own account and for others. 
In this business he is associated with R. H. Swinerton as a partner and the 
firm enjoys a large clientage. They have negotiated many important realty 
transfers and in addition they do a large agency business in the line of in- 
surance and otherwise, representing the tug Sadie, the Connecticut Fire In- 
surance Company, the Silver Hustler Mining Company, Limited, the Vic- 



622 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

toria Mining &amp; Development Company, Limited, and others. The firm- 
maintains an office at io6 Government street in Victoria. 

In his poHtical views and affihations Mr. O'ddy is a Conservative, but is 
not active in poHtics. As alderman of his city he is giving his best efforts 
to advancing its best welfare and progress. Socially he is an active member 
of Victoria Columbia Lodge, No. i, A. F. &amp; A. M., and has been the efficient 
secretary of this organization for the past ten years. 

GEORGE THOMSON. 

George Thomson has been prominently identified with the commercial 
interests of Nanaimo, Wellington and Ladysmith for the past thirty years, 
the entire period of his adult life, and he has attained a deservedly high 
position in the business circles of the province. He has worked his way to 
the top through the liberal expenditure of his own energy and intelligence, 
and has himself to thank for the success which has rewarded his efforts. 
He is accordingly esteemed among his fellow men and business associates, 
and is recognized as one of the most substantial and enterprising men of the 
town of Ladysmith, which has beai his place of residence for several years. 

Mr. Thomson is a native of the famous old city of Ayr, Scotland, where 
he was born February ii, 1855, being a son of David and Catherine (Smith) 
Thomson, the former of whom is deceased and the latter still living in Scot- 
land. After a period of education in the public schools of Ayr he served 
his time in the grocery business, and learned all its details and fitted himself 
thoroughly for his extensive business career. In 1873, being then a young 
man of eighteen, he came to Nanaimo and entered the service of Harvey 
and Dunsmuir. He spent ten years in the employ of that firm, and was 
manager of their business at Wellington for some time. He then went 
into the general merchandise business at Nanaimo on his own account, but 
soon sold out. He then became manager of the business of A. R. Johnson 
and Company at Nanaimo, and continued in that responsible capacity for 
six years. Since then he has been prominently identified with the official 
affairs of his district. He was appointed assistant to Government Agent 
Marshal Bray at Nanaimo, and after nine years in that capacity he received 
the appointment of government agent at Ladysmith, the duties of which 
post he has since efficiently discharged. He also holds the offices of assessor 
and collector, stipendiary magistrate, gold commissioner, registrar of births, 
deaths and marriages. He has also taken considerable interest in general 
politics, and from 1886 to 1890 he represented the Nanaimo- Albernie dis- 
trict in the provincial parliament. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 523 

Mr. Thomson is a past master of Ashlar Lodge No. 3, A. F. &amp; A. M., 
and also affiliates with the Ancient Order of United Workmen. His church 
connection is with the Church of England. He was married in 1877 to Miss 
Sabra Gough. a daughter of Edwin Gough, of Nanaimo. They have two 
children, Walter Edwin and Robert Gough. 

JOHN PETERSON. 

John Peterson is the venerable and honored founder of the city of 
Kamloops, British Columbia. At the age of nearly eighty years, he is still 
actively interested in the material affairs of this part of the country, being 
one of the leading ranchers and stock-raisers. His long career has been 
spent in varied activity in different parts of the world, and to one acquainted 
with the energetic and resolute old gentleman of today it is not surprising 
that he has been able to leave the impress of his activity on many enter- 
prises and that his life has been fraught with eminent usefulness and honor. 

From the age of fifteen years Mr. Peterson has been doing for himself 
and prosecuting his career of unusual activity. Born at Rotterdam, Hol- 
land, on July 18, 1825, being one of the children bom of his good Dutch 
parents, Thomas P. and Arbra Mina Johanna (Delaus) Peterson, the son 
passed the first fifteen years of his life in the peace and security of his parental 
home, but then cast loose his home moorings and as an apprentice boy on 
a ship went to the East Indies. He followed the sea until he was twenty- 
five years old, in the meantime becoming an able sailor. In 1850 he landed 
at San Francisco, which on the following day was devastated by the terrible 
fire of that year, and from that city he went to the mining regions about 
Trinidad and on the north fork of the Salmon river. He was one of the few 
who were successful in the search for gold, and he spent five years at it. 
He then ran a pack train between Trinidad, Red Bluff and Shasta, and con- 
tinued this enterprise until 1861. In 1862 he came up into British Columbia 
as a member of a surveying corps, and, having sold out his pack train, he 
located at Kamloops. He located this town and named the townsite, and in 
the wilderness which surrounded the place in that early year he gave incep- 
tion to the commercial center which has since expanded into one of the im- 
portant towns of interior British Columbia. He took up three hundred and 
twenty acres on the townsite, and then purchased three hundred and twenty 
more. He disposed of all this townsite land in 1866. He is now the owner 
of two thousand acres situated seventeen miles from Kamloops, and on this 
extensive tract he raises cattle, horses and hogs and conducts general farm- 
ing and fruit-raising. 



524 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. Peterson's wife is now deceased. He is a member, of the Presby- 
terian church, and in pohtics is a Conservative. Besides the property al- 
ready mentioned he has interests in coal lands, and he has long" been recog- 
nized as one of the substantial and thoroughly reliable business men of the 
district, 

WILLIAM ALEXANDER MACDONALD. 

William Alexander Macdonald, one of the distinguished representatives 
of the legal fraternity of British Columbia who has figured prominently in 
political circles both in the Dominion and in the province, is well fitted for 
leadership because of the careful study that he has made of the questions and 
issues which affect the people at large and because of his unquestioned devo- 
tion to the general good. A conscientious performance of every public serv- 
ice combined with strong intellectuality and marked individuality have made 
him distinctively a man of affairs and one who has wielded a wide influence. 

William Alexander Macdonald, now residing in Nelson, was born in St. 
Catherine, Ontario, June 7, i860, his parents being Frederick William and 
Eliza (Clara) Macdonald. His early education was acquired in the public 
schools, after which he entered the office of his father, who was master in 
chancery for thirty years. Thus completing his law studies under able direc- 
tion, he was admitted to the bar of Osgood's Hall, Ontario, in 1882. Think- 
ing that he would find better field for activity in western districts he went to 
Manitoba the same year and was admitted to practice there. Opening an 
office in Brandon he at once entered upon practice and continued at that place 
for fifteen years or until the latter part of 1896. On the ist of January, 
1897, he arrived in Nelson and has since been a resident of this city. He 
has throughout his professional career made consecutive advancement, as he 
has demonstrated his ability to cope with the intricate problems of juris- 
prudence. His knowledge of the law in all its departments is exact and 
comprehensive and in the trial of a case he prepares himself with great 
thoroughness and presents his case in clear, forcible, logical manner, so that 
he never fails to make an impress upon the minds of the court or the jury, 
and seldom fails to gain the verdict desired. His devotion to his client's in- 
terests is proverbial and yet he never forgets that he owes a higher allegiance 
to the majesty of the law. He acted as the first counsel for the first jury 
trial held in the western district of Manitoba, and his practice in Nelson is of 
an important character, connecting him with the leading litigated interests 
tried in the courts of this locality. 

Mr. Macdonald has been a recognized leader in political circles both in 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 525 

Manitoba and in British Columbia. He contested North Brandon with the 
Hon. CHfford Sifton, the present minister of the interior of Canada, in the 
general election of 1888. In 1892 he was the candidate of his party in the 
contest for the city of Brandon against the Hon. James A. Smart, now 
minister of public works of Manitoba, and won the election. In the follow- 
ing session of the legislature he was chosen leader of the opposition and 
during his term in the legislative assembly managed and was mainly instru- 
mental in securing the passage of the workmen's compensation act, giving 
the workingmen the right of action against their employers arising by in- 
juries sustained. In 1893 he retired from the political field, but was again 
induced to enter politics in the general election of 1896, but in a contest with 
the late L. Alton McCarthy, Q. C.,- was defeated on the school question. He 
has made a close and earnest study of the issues that involved the welfare of 
his country and in his course he has placed the question of general good be- 
fore partisanship, and the welfare of all before personal aggrandizement. 

It was during a pleasure visit to Nelson that Mr. Macdonald decided to 
locate here and with the interests of this city he has since been actively iden- 
tified. He was married in 1884 to Miss Mary E. Gamble, a native of Dun- 
ville, Ontario, and they have four children: Flora, Helen, Greta and Bruce. 
Their home is celebrated for its gracious and attractive hospitality and Mr. 
Macdonald is not only prominent in this manner, but is also interested in 
many lines of activity having direct bearing upon the business, social, in- 
tellectual and moral welfare of his community. He is a Mason and belongs 
to the Anglican church. He takes an active interest in athletics and was 
for years president of the Manitoba Lacrosse Association and is president of 
the Nelson Lacrosse and Hockey Association. He was appointed a Queen's 
Counsel in 1892, and at this writing is president of the Nelson Bar Associa- 
tion. ^. 

HON. GEORGE H. BARNARD. 

The subject of this sketch, George Henry Barnard, is known as a man 
of high attainments and as one who has achieved success in the legal profes- 
sion. He is now serving as the mayor of Victoria, entering upon the duties 
of that high official position in 1904, and his administration of the city's 
affairs has been businesslike, progressive and public-spirited. He is a native 
son of this city, his birth having occurred on the 9th of October, 1868, his 
parents being F. J. and Ellen (Stillman) Barnard, natives respectively of 
Quebec and Ireland. They came to this province in 1859, and the father was 
the originator of the express stage line to the Cariboo country, conducting 



I 



526 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the same for a number of years. He served as a member of the provincial 
parhament before the confederation and was also a representative in the 
Dominion house for a number of years or until his retirement from active 
life. He always took a deep interest in public affairs, and to the best of his 
ability promoted the best interests of his fellow citizens. Both he and his 
wife died in the year 1889. Three of their children survive, the brother 
and sister of our subject being : F. S. Barnard, now a member of the 
House of Commons from the Cariboo District and a resident of Victoria, 
and Alice T., who became the wife of J. A. Mara, and they also maintain 
their home in Victoria. 

George Henry Barnard received his elementary education in the Trin- 
ity College School, Port Hope, Ontario, while his legal training was received 
in the offices of Eberts &amp; Taylor and Charles Wilson, and he was admitted 
to the bar in 1891. He is now a member of the firm of Barnard &amp; Rogers. 
In politics he has also served well his part, and in 1902 was elected for the 
ofifice of alderman, to which he was re-elected in 1903, while in the follow- 
ing year, 1904, he was made the mayor of Victoria. He is now giving the 
closest attention to the duties of his office, doing all in his power to advance 
the interests of the city in which he has so long made his homie, and both 
as a professional man and public official he is highly esteemed by his hosts 
of friends. 

In the year 1895 Mr. Barnard was united in marriage to Miss Ethel 
B. Rogers, the daughter of Colonel H. C. Rogers. Mr. and Mrs. Barnard 
are members of the Church of England. 

JOHN STEWART. 

John Stewart, a prominent real estate man of Ladysmith, has devoted 
nearly all his life to finance and business, and has had a steady, consistent 
and honorable rise from a humble position in a local bank in his native city 
through various grades of responsibility, and only recently gave up the 
active management of banking affairs in order to engage in his present busi- 
ness. 

A son of John and Isabella (McKenzie) Stewart, both of whom are 
deceased, Mr. Stewart was born in Glasgow, Scotland, October 29, 1864, 
and his early education was completed at Hamilton Academy, Hamilton, 
Scotland. As soon as he left school he entered the Royal Bank of Scotland, 
and was associated with this institution for ten years, being five years in 
Glasgow and five years in London. He then came out to the Dominion 
to enter the employ of the Bank of British Columbia, and continued with 



V 1 \'. &gt;' 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 627 

that great banking house for a number of years, being stationed success- 
ively at Vancouver. Nelson, Victoria and in Nanaimo, for varying periods 
of time. It was for the purix)se of taking charge of a branch of the insti- 
tution that he came to Ladysmith, where he remained a year and a half 
in that capacity, until the branch bank was amalgamated with the Canadian 
Bank of Commerce. Since then he has opened a real estate, insurance and 
mining office at Ladysmith, and is conducting these various lines of busi- 
ness with much success. He is also prominent in town and community af- 
fairs, being a notary public, justice of the peace, clerk of the municipal coun- 
cil and president of the board of trade. 

Mr. Stewart was married in 1893 to Miss Elizabeth Durham Clarke, 
a daughter of the late Rev. R. H. Clarke, of Clones, county Monahan, Ire- 
land. Their two children are John Holmes Kennedy and Aileen. Mr. 
Stewart is a member of St. Johns Lodge No. 21, A. F. &amp; A. M. In politics 
he is a Conservative, and is a Presbyterian in church affiliation. 

GEORGE FREDERICK BALDWIN. 

Vancouver, the city marvelous of the Pacific coast country, claims 
George Frederick Baldwin among its residents. He belongs to the little 
group of distinctively representative men who have been the pioneers in in- 
augurating and building up the interests and industries of this section of 
the country. He early had the sagacity and prescience to discern the emi- 
nence which the future had in store for this great and growing country and 
acting in accordance with the dictates of his faith and judgment he allied his 
interests with the new city and throughout the whole of its existence has 
served as its treasurer, assessment commissioner and tax collector. More- 
over, his continuance in office stands as incontrovertible evidence of his ability 
and the confidence reposed in him by his fellow townsmen. 

Mr. Baldwin was born in New Brunswick, January 10, 1850, and is of 
English and Irish descent. His father, Thomas Baldwin, was born in 
England and married Miss Jane Acheson, a native of Ireland. They emi- 
grated to New Brunswick and there George F. Baldwin was born. His 
education, however, was acquired in Woodstock College in Ontario, and he 
entered the field of active business life as a school teacher, following that 
profession in Ontario and in Manitoba. Recognizing that " westward the 
star of empire takes its way," and that the rapid growth of the Pacific coast 
country was offering splendid business opportunities he went to Victoria, 
British Columbia, in 1884. There he served on the staff of the Times as a 
reporter for about a year and then came to Vancouver just prior to the in- 



528 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

corporation and naming of the town, believing that this city was to be the 
great business center of British Columbia. He made his way here and in 
April, 1886, he was elected the first treasurer of the new city and has since 
filled that oflfice in a manner creditable to himself and highly satisfactory to 
his fellow townsmen. He was also elected a member of the first school board 
of the city and served in that office for seven years, doing all in his power 
for the establishment of an educational system that would be of great benefit 
to the younger generation here. In every public office that he has filled he 
has discharged his duties with promptness and fidelity. The taxes collected 
by him the first year amounted to twenty-three thousand eight hundred dollars, 
and the gitDwth of the city is indicated by the fact that the annual tax receipts 
of the present time are three hundred and eighty-five thousand two hundred 
dollars. There is no city east or west that has made such astonishing growth 
as Vancouver, its population increasing in twenty years from about six 
hundred to forty thousand. There is no modern improvement of an eastern 
metropolis that cannot be found here and the splendid work of development 
has been carried forward by such men as Mr. Baldwin — men who have con- 
centrated their energies in making this one of the leading cities of the Pacific 
coast country. 

THOMAS G. PROCTER. 

While it is impossible to determine what would have been the fate of 
Nelson and the Kootenay district had not Thomas G. Procter established 
his home within the borders of this locality, the history of the district plainly 
indicates the value of his labors and their far-reaching effects. The term 
promoter is comparatively a modern one of the English language, having 
come as the result of business conditions and it is a term entirely applicable 
to Mr. Procter, who, possessing keen discrimination, has rapidly noticed the 
opportunities of the northwest and has. utilized these in promoting his in- 
dividual success as well as in advancing the public progress. His efforts have 
had direct effect upon the substantial upbuilding and consecutive advance- 
ment of his community and looking beyond the exigencies of the moment to 
the possibilities of the future he has wrought along lines that have benefited 
present generations and will prove most helpful for years to come. 

Mr. Procter was born in Lancashire, England, September 12, 1862, his 
parents being Gilbert and Mary (Gorton) Procter, both deceased. He ac- 
quired his early education in the public schools of his native county .ind when 
fourteen years of age went to sea, spending two years upon a training ship. 
While thus occupied he won the queen's medal. He remained at sea for 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 529 

three years and was in the naval reserve as midshipman. In 1881 he crossed 
the Atlantic to the United States and for some time was engaged in the 
cattle business in the middle portion of that country. 

In 1 89 1 Mr. Procter arrived in British Columbia, where he turned his 
attention to mining and prospecting. A short time convinced him of the 
excellent future which was in store for the country because of its superior 
natural advantages and business possibilities. He then purchased land and 
established the first fruit farm of the country. He was also the founder of 
the town of Procter, which is now owned by him and by the Canadian Pacific 
Railway Company as a town site. He built the hotel there and the place has 
become a popular summer resort. Since 1894 Mr. Procter has been the 
manager of the Kootenay Valleys Company, originally owning thirty thou- 
sand acres of land, and through the control of real estate interests has con- 
tributed in large measure to the settlement of various districts. He was 
also manager of the York &amp; Lancaster syndicate which purchased the Alice 
mine. This property is now leased and a tramway and concentrator have 
been built at a cost of seventy-five thousand dollars. Mr. Procter is con- 
ducting a general real estate, mining and insurance business and is heavily 
interested in mining in his own country. He is a director in the Common- 
wealth mines and he opened up the Blairmore country coal mines, selling that 
property for one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. These mines 
have an eight foot vein of coal and there are thirteen different shafts. 

In 1888 Mr. Procter was united in marriage to Miss Beatrice Arrow- 
smith, a native of Lancashire, England. He belongs to Newlson lodge, 
No. 23, A. F. &amp; A. M., and also holds membership with the Sons of England. 
His has been an extremely busy, useful and active life. Starting out for 
himself at the early age of fourteen years he has without the assistance of 
influential friends or adventitious circumstances gradually worked his way 
upward to a position of prominence and prosperity. His has been an event- 
ful career and he has intimate knowledge of many of- the important move- 
ments which have shaped the policy, promoted the upbuilding and formulated 
the history of the Kootenay district. His influence has ever been a factor for 
good and his name is deeply inscribed in the keystone of the arch of its 
honored pioneers. 

J. M. LAY. 

J. M. Lay, a prominent representative of financial interests in Nelson, 
was born in London, England, in 1869, and came to Canada in 1887, being 
at that time about eighteen years of age. In 1889 he entered the service of 



530 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the Imperial Bank of Canada at Gait. In 1891 he went to Calgary, re- 
maining in the employ of the Imperial Bank of Canada at that place and 
afterwards at Edmonton. In November, 1898, he arrived iri Nelson, British 
Columbia, to open the branch establishment of the Imperial Bank of Canada 
in this city. He has since been in charge and has been able to see the busi- 
ness of the institution grow yearly. He is a young man of marked enter- 
prise and business capacity, and is now serving his second term as president 
of the Nelson Board of Trade. Mr. Lay is married but has no children. 
His life is characterized by the progressive and enterprising spirit which has 
been the dominant factor in the rapid and substantial development of. the 
northwest and he is recognized as one of the leading men of the Kootenay 
country. 

WILLIAM CHRISTIE. 

William Christie is local manager for the Canadian Pacific Railway 
Company's Telegraph at Victoria, which position he has occupied for some 
thirteen years. • He has been a resident of Victoria and connected with the 
telegraph service for the past twenty years. Mr. Christie is a native of Nova 
Scotia, and was born in Pictou, February 5, 1863. His ancestry is Scotch, 
and his father, Rev. James Christie, was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, was 
educated at Aberdeen University and was ordained to the Presbyterian min- 
istry. He then being a young man and of high capabilities, emigrated to 
Nova Scotia, where he engaged in ministerial and educational pursuits in 
various portions of the province. He married Isabel Crichton, a native of 
Pictou. Her father, Peter Crichton, was a pioneer settler of that part of 
Nova Scotia, was a well known shipbuilder and ship owner, and a prominent 
man in his day. One of Mr. Christie's sisters, Mrs. J. W. Creighton, now 
resides in New Westminster, another, Mrs. W. A. McGuire, at Ben 
Lomond, California, and two, Mrs. A. S. Innes and Miss Caroline Christie, 
also a younger brother, James Douglas, reside in Victoria. The family 
came to British Columbia in 1883. Rev. James Christie died February 12, 
1902, and his wife followed him to the grave on March 15, 1903. 

Mr. Christie himself was educated in Nova Scotia. At the age of 
seventeen he began learning telegraphy in the office of the old Dominion 
Telegraph Company, at Truro, Nova Scotia, and he was later in the employ of 
the Western Union Telegraph Company at various Nova Scotia points. In 
1882 he went to Texas, and for a short period turned his attention to sheep- 
raising. He afterward held positions as telegraph operator in various Texas 
cities,' including San Antonio and Galveston. He came to Victoria in 188 J 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 531 

and for the next seven years filled the positions of day or night operator. 
On September i, 1891, he was promoted to the management of the office 
in Victoria, the position which he is now filling. 

In 1889 Mr. Christie was married to Miss Annie Sinclair Holmes, who 
was also born in Pictou county, Nova Scotia, and died July 24, 1904. Her 
father, Donald Allen Holmes, was descended from a well known Nova Scotia 
family. Mr. Christie is a member of the Victoria Board of Trade, being on 
the auditing committee. He has fraternal affiliations with the Independent 
Order of Odd Fellows. 

THOMAS KIDDIE. 

Thomas Kiddie, manager of the Tyee Copper company at Ladysmith. 
has been engaged in the work of theoretical and practical metallurgy and 
similar branches throughout his life, from the time of boyhood, and has 
made a substantial and honorable career in the industry, gaining the rewards 
and material position which are the results of such an application of useful 
energy and scientific skill. 

Born in North Shields. England,, December 20, 1855, a son of John 
and Margaret (Martin) Kiddie, both deceased, Mr. Kiddie was educated in 
the public and private schools of his locality, and at an early age became 
introduced to the serious occupations of life as an apprentice to a drug busi- 
ness. Serving three years at that, he then entered the Bede Metal and Chem- 
ical Company, at Jarrow-on-Tyne. During his ten years' employment with 
this company he attended science classes at Elswick Mechanics Institute, and 
then, passing the government examinations, was from 1879 to 1882 in- 
structor in chemistry and metallurgy in the Science and Art school at New- 
castle-on-Tyne and at Jarrow Mechanics Institute. In the meantime he at- 
tended lectures on iron manufacture, and still has in his possession a bronze 
medal which he received in recognition for writing a paper on iron manu- 
facture. 

In 1882 Mr. Kiddie came to the United States as chemist for the Or- 
ford Copper and Nickel Company of Bergen Point, New Jersey, where he 
remained for six years. In 1888 he became superintendent of Senator Will- 
iam A. Clark's smelter at San Pedro, New Mexico, and two years later went 
to Park county, Colorado, and assumed the management of the London 
mine. In the fall of 1893 the Orford Copper Company engaged him to go to 
Europe as expert metallurgist in the trial of some nickel patent cases, and 
after that work was completed he continued in the employ of the company, 
engaged in the refining of copper and nickel until 1898. This year is the 



532 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

date of his coming to British Columbia, at which time he built a smelter 
for the Van Anda Copper Company at Van Anda, Texada island. In 1900 
he was appointed manager of the mines and smelter of this company, and 
held the position until the works were closed down in 1902. He then de- 
signed and built the smelter at Ladysmith for the Tyee Copper Company, 
and has since retained the responsible position of manager of this concern, 
whicli under his direction has become such an important factor in the indus- 
trial activity of Ladysmith. Mr. Kiddie is the patentee of a process for the 
separation of arsenic, bismuth, etc., from copper solutions. In 1903 he pat- 
ented a design for a gravity discharge boat for the carrying and automatic 
discharging of the cargo, adapted for the carrying of ores, coal and other 
loose or bulk materials, in which the shoveling is entirely eliminated. He 
is also author of what is known in the copper trade as the combination 
method for the estimation of silver and gold in copper mattes, bullion, etc., 
the method being based on the extreme insolubility of chloride of silver in 
sulphate solutions. This method and the method by scorification being the 
standard methods as recommended by Dr. Ledoux, of New York. 

Mr. Kiddie stands high in his profession, as may be inferred from the 
fact that he is president of the British Columbia Institute of Assayers and 
is one of the provincial board of examiners for assayers. He affiliates with 
Beacon Light Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., at New Brighton, New Jersey; is a 
member of the Presbyterian church, and in politics is independent. 

Mr. Kiddie was married in 1880 to Miss Hannah E. Hogg, a daughter 
of George Hogg, of North Shields, England. They have two sons who 
already in young manhood have given great promise of future usefulness. 
John has recently graduated as a civil engineer from Cornell University, 
New York state, and his career will be along that line. The son George is 
on the artists' staff of the San Francisco Examiner. 

JOHN AUGUST ERICKSON. 

A little thoughtful consideration of the career of John August Erickson, 
proprietor of the Grand Central Hotel at Nelson, brings one to the conclusion 
that he has in most of his business operations been impelled by the spirit of 
the pioneer. He has sought out new plans and conditions likely to favor his 
projects and after he has made them available and profitable he has sought 
out still others and after those others. The wisdom of his selection has 
been proven by the success which has crowned his efforts. In the conduct 
of his hotel he seems " to the manner born," having a comprehensive grasp 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 533 

of the hotel business and an intimate knowledge of all the details of good 
hotel keeping. 

Mr. Erickson was born in Sweden, February 27, 1870, and his parents, 
Erick Anderson and Margarita (Johnson) Anderson, are yet residents of 
Stockholm. He attended the public schools in the land of his nativity and 
afterward worked upon the home farm until 1888, when desirous of bettering 
his financial condition by the utilization of business opportunities of the new 
world he made his way to the United States, where he was engaged in rail- 
roading. The year 1892 witnessed his arrival in British Columbia, and he was 
employed on Columbia river steamboats until the summer of 1895, when he 
embarked in the hotel business at Kaslo, conducting a hostelry there until 
1897. He afterward built a hotel at Slocan City and later one at Kootenay 
Landing. On selling the last mentioned he came to Nelson and purchased an 
interest in the Lakeview Hotel, while in 1891 he purchased the Grand Central 
Hotel, which he is now conducting. This is a three story structure, fifty by 
one hundred feet, and contains forty rooms. He and his partner own the 
land and the buildings and have also conducted the Lakeview Hotel. 

On the ist of June, 1904, Mr. Erickson was united in marriage to Miss 
Maggie Newman, a native of New Zealand. He is deputy grand chancellor 
commander of the Knights of Pythias and is treasurer of the Fraternal Order 
of Eagles, while his religious faith is indicated by his membership in the 
Methodist church. His has been an active, useful and honorable career. 
The subject of this review is a self-made man, who, without any extraordin- 
ary family or pecuniary advantages at the commencement of life, has battled 
earnestly and energetically, and by indomitable courage and integrity has 
achieved both character and fortune. By sheer force of will and untiring ef- 
fort he has worked his way upward and is numbered among the leading busi- 
ness men of British Columbia. 

FRANK HENRY PRICE. 

Frank Henry Price, a well known hotel proprietor in the Cowichan dis- 
trict, has also been successfully engaged in other enterprises during his resi- 
dence in British Columbia, and has long been considered among the prom- 
inent men of affairs of his community. Mr. Price is a man of thorough in- 
tegrity, of excellent executive ability, and has a high degree of public spirit 
which makes him a valuable factor in the material welfare and progress of 
his town and district. 

Mr. Price is a native of Gloucestershire, England, where he was born 
March 13, 1866. He came out to the Dominion in 1880, and in Toronto, 



534 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Canada, and in Manitoba followed various occupations for several years. 
In 1885 he located in Cowichan, British Columbia, and engaged in surveying 
with Mr. E. M. Skinner for two years. Following that he became interested 
in the hotel business, and has been more or less closely and successfully iden- 
tified with the pursuit ever since. He, with his late partner, Mr. Percy 
Gayres, built the old Qualmichan Hotel, which they conducted three years, 
and after selling out he managed the aerated water business of Thorpe &amp; 
Company of Vancouver and Victoria, and is still interested in this enter- 
prise. He built the Lakeside Hotel at Cowichan Lake, and he and his 
brother, Mr. E. A. Price, run this popular hostelry, and in 1901 he erected 
the Tzouhalen Hotel at Duncans, a public house which he conducted in a 
first class manner, is well equipped, has an excellent cuisine, and under the 
direct management of Mr. Price its success has been cumulative from the 
first. 

Mr. Price was married in May, 1899, to Miss Edith Booth, a daughter 
of George Booth, of Victoria. They have one child, Frederick. Mr. Price 
affiliates with Temple lodge. No. 33, A. F. &amp; A. M., is a Conservative in 
politics, and his religious faith is that of the Church of England. 

THOMAS GIFFORD. 

Thomas Gifford, well known in the business and political circles of New 
Westminster, moved to this city twenty years ago, establishing a jewelry 
business, and he has conducted this with broad and generous success to the 
present time. A thorough student of public problems and a worker for the 
civic welfare, he has been actively interested in the domain of politics, and 
has been placed in various offices of trust through the votes of his fellow 
citizens. 

Mr. Gifford was born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, in 1854, being a son 
of William and Margaret (Stewart) Gifford, of staunch and long established 
Scotch race and lineage. His father was a grocer. Reared in Dumfries- 
shire, at the age of fourteen he left grammar school and became an apprentice 
to the jeweler's trade. In 1878, when a young man of twenty-four years, 
he emigrated to the United States, and during the seven subsequent years 
was in the line of his regular business at St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1885 he 
located in New Westminster, and this has been his permanent home ever 
since. He has a large and profitable business, and has one of the best jewelry 
houses in the province. 

Turning to his more essentially public career, he served eight years as a 
member of the city council; was a member of the school board seven years, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 535 

for a number of years was on the board of trustees of the Royal Columbian 
Hospital. In politics a supporter of Conservative principles, he was elected 
to the provincial parliament in 1891, being again returned in 1893, and in 
1897, 1901 and 1903. Mr. Gififord performs an active part in fraternal mat- 
ters, being affiliated with the Masons, the Ancient Order of United Work- 
men, the Knights of Pythias and the Sons of Scotland. 

Mr. Gifford married, in 1877, Miss Annie Stoddard, a native of Scot- 
land. Their first two children, William and Thomas, were born in the land 
of hills and heather, and the children born on this side of the Atlantic are 
Maggie, James, Julia, Hugh and John. 

HILLIARD JOHN WASSON, M. D. 

Dr. Hilliard John Wasson, of Ladysmith, has in the course of three or 
four years' practice established himself thoroughly in the esteem of the com- 
munity as a reliable and progressive practitioner, and his skill and ability 
are unquestioned in every household that he has ever attended in a profes- 
sional capacity. During the twelve years or more of his active practice he 
has advanced rapidly in individual power ancj general usefulness, and has 
added broad experience and efficiency to a complete theoretical preparation 
for the most arduous as also the most beneficent profession which engages 
the energies of man. 

Dr. Wasson, born September 4, 1870, in Peterboro,- Ontario, where his 
parents, John and Susan (McBurney) Wasson, are both living at the present 
writing, attended the public school and the collegiate institute of his native 
town, and then took up the study of medicine in the famous institution, Mc- 
Gill University, where he was gi*aduated with the class of 1892 and with the 
degree of M. D. For one year following he was house surgeon in the Mon- 
treal General Hospital, where he became additionally well equipped for suc- 
cessful prosecution of his life work. He then came to Wellington, British 
Columbia, and started practice as an assistant of the late Dr. Eberts, whose 
successor in practice he later became. From Wellington he moved to Ex- 
tension, and thence to Ladysmith in 1901, where he cares for a large and 
constantly extending general practice, and is also colliery physician. 

Dr. Wasson was married in 1897 to Miss Ethel Harte Wyman, a 
daughter of B. H. Wyman, of Oakland, California. Dr. Wasson is affiliated 
with St. John's Lodge No. 21, A. F. &amp; A. M., and is a member of the British 
Columbia Medical Association.

GEORGE A. B. HALL, M. D. 

The Kootenay district with its pulsing industrial activities and rapid 
development, has attracted v^ithin its confines men of marked ability and 
high character in the various professional lines, and in this way progress 
has been conserved and social stability fostered. He whose name initiates 
this review has gained recognition as one of the able and successful physicians 
of the province, and by his labors, his high professional attainments and his 
sterling characteristics has justified the respect and confidence in which he 
is held by medical fraternity and the local public. 

George Arthur Benjamin Hall was born in Ottawa, Ontario, on the 29th 
of October, 1868, his parents being Lewis and Elizabeth (Beardsmore) Hall, 
both of whom are now deceased. The father was born in England and was 
an extensive traveler. He was in Australia at the time of the gold excite- 
ment in that country and afterward came to British Columbia, arriving in 
Victoria when his son. Dr. Hall, was but seven years of age and received 
his public school education in this province. His ambition for education 
being not yet satisfied he went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he pre- 
pared for a professional career as a student in the dental college of that city. 
He also matriculated in the Medico Chirurgical College of Philadelphia, but 
being taken ill he left college and returned to Nanaimo, British Columbia, 
where he engaged in dental practice for two years. He then entered Cooper 
Medical College of San Francisco, completing a course by graduation with 
the class of 1895, and has since taken two post-graduate courses, one in the 
New York Polyclinic in 1898, the other in Johns Hopkins University, in 1904. 
Again coming to British Columbia Dr. Hall successfully passed an examina- 
tion before the British Columbia Medical board and located for practice in 
Nelson, where he has since remained, enjoying a constantly growing patron- 
age, which is indicative of the trust reposed in him by the general public. 
He is resident physician of the Canadian Pacific Railroad and also of the 
Hall mines and smelter. He is provincial health officer and jail physician, 
discharging his various official duties in connection with those of a large pri- 
vate practice which makes a constant demand upon his time and energies. 
Everything which tends to bring to man the key to that complex mysytery 
which we call life elicits his earnest attention and interest. He has studied 
broadly and thought deeply concerning the science of medicine and its pos- 
sibilities, and his efforts in behalf of suffering humanity have been attended 
with splendid success. 

In 1893 Dr. Hall was united in marriage to Miss Christina Pool, a 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 537 

native of Cariboo and a representative of one of the old pioneer families of 
the province. They have three children : Norman Douglas, Earle Reginald 
and Allan Beardsmore. The family is prominent socially in Nelson and the 
hospitality of the best homes of the city is freely extended to the members 
of Dr. Hall's household. Fraternally he is connected with Nelson lodge, 
No. 23, A. F. &amp; A. M., and Nelson lodge, No. 25, K. P., while professionally 
he is identified with the British Columbia Medical Association and the 
Canadian Medical Association. His career has been a busy and useful one, 
marked by the utmost fidelity to the duties of public and private life and 
crowned with success that came to him in recognition of superior merit. 
His name is inseparably interwoven with the annals of Nelson and the 
Kootenay district and with its best development and stable progress. 

DAVID GEORGE KURTZ. 

David George Kurtz, one of the partners in the Nelson Freighting &amp; 
Transfer Company at Nelson, is numbered among the native sons of British 
Columbia, his birth having occurred in Victoria on the 23d of March, 1877. 
His father, David Kurtz, has passed away, but the mother, Mrs. Martha 
(Redfern) Kurtz, still survives and makes her home in Victoria. 

At the usual age David G. Kurtz entered the public schools and con- 
tinued his studies in the high school until fifteen years of age, when he put 
aside his text books in order to become a factor in the business world. He 
entered the office of the Albion Iron Works Company and was thus employed 
for three years. In 1895 he came to Nelson and here engaged in the steam- 
boat business, being associated therewith for six years either as mate or cap- 
tain. He afterward assisted in organizing the Nelson Freighting &amp;■ Trans- 
fer Company, purchasing the business of the Nelson Transfer Company, and 
on September 30, 1901, he also purchased the business of the Pacific Transfer 
Company, which he merged with his other interests under the name of the 
Nelson Freighting &amp; Transfer Company. In addition to his freight and 
transfer business he and his partners are agents for the Melrose Company of 
Victoria, and the Pacific Coal Company of Banff. They keep about thirty 
horses for use in their business and are meeting with excellent success in their 
; undertakings. 

Mr. Kurtz is a member of Nelson lodge. No. 23, A. F. &amp; A. M., and he 

tjalso belongs to the Church of England. In his political views he is a Liberal 

and while not an aspirant for office he keeps well informed on the questions 

ind issues of the day. As the years have gone by he has developed an ex- 

jelient business in Nelson through the recognition and utilization of oppor- 



538 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

tunity and he has the full confidence of the business community. He is yet 
a young man, possessing the marked enterprise and laudable ambition which 
have been the important features in the upbuilding of this section of the 
country. 

RICHARD MASON PALMER. 

Richard Mason Palmer, whose prominence and influence in the province 
are widely acknowledged, is provincial freight rate commissioner of British 
Columbia, is secretary of the bureau of information and immigration and a 
member of the provincial board of horticulture. In addition to his public 
service he has large interests in commercial fruit-raising and also in mining 
properties, demonstrating to the W'Orld the possibilities of British Colurqbia 
as a fruit-raising country and giving proof of confidence in the rich mineral 
resources wdiich nature has provided in northwestern America. 

Mr. Palmer is a native of England, born in Gayton, Norfolk, on the 12th 
of March, 1859. He was educated at S waff ham grammar school, and after- 
ward pursued a special course in agriculture, chemistry and horticulture. 
The year 1 881 witnessed his emigration tO' the new world. He settled near 
Winnipeg, and for a few years was engaged in farming and stock-raising in 
that locality. In 1888 he came to British Columbia and developed and 
managed the Belle Meade fruit farm at Hazel-Mere, British Columbia. This 
place included seventy-five acres, principally devoted to the raising of Italian 
prunes, pears, apples and plums. He was also engaged in breeding thorough- 
bred Jersey stock and farmed one hundred and fifty acres of land, on which 
w^as produced excellent crops of hay and grain. In his farming operations 
he met with very desirable success, and upon the sale of this property was 
appointed provincial fruit inspector, filling that office until 1901. During 
the latter part of that period he also occupied the position of provincial freight 
rate commissioner, and in 1904 was appointed secretary of the bureau of 
provincial information and immigration. 

Mr. Palmer is the owner of a fine residence and fruit ranch near Victoria, 
having twenty-five acres planted to apples, pears, plums and cherries. He 
has also a young orchard of thirty-five acres near Vernon planted to apples, 
plums and cherries. The Victoria orchards are now in good bearing condi- 
tion, and much of the fruit is shipped to Manitoba and the northwest terri- 
tories. He is also raising fine strawberries and other small fruits, and his 
labors have proved of marked value to British Columbia in demonstrating 
the adaptability of the soil for horticulture. 

On the 14th of July, 1884, occurred the marriage of Mr. Palmer and 




C7 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 539 

Miss Edith Mary Oldfield, a native of Norfolk. England, the wedding taking 
place in Manitoba. They have had six children, three born in Manitoba and 
three in British Columbia, namely: Walter Richard, Rose Mary, Horace, 
Frank, Richard Claxton and Beatrice Lucy. In 1901 Mr. Palmer was called 
upon to mourn the loss of his wife, who departed this life on the i6th of 
June of that year. Theirs had been an ideal married life and most congenial 
companionship, and the loss of the wife and mother has been a very great one 
to the family. Mr. Palmer is a member of the Church of England, and is 
prominent in Masonic circles, serving as senior steward of his lodge in Vic- 
toria. For many years he has been a member of the Independent Order of 
Odd Fellows, and passed all of its chairs in England. He has firm faith 
in the great northwest, recognizing its splendid natural resources and excel- 
lent business opportunities, and through his private and business interests he 
has promoted general business development, and in official circles has ren- 
dered the province a service that has been most effective and benficial. 

ANDREW JAMES McMURTRIE. 

Andrew James McMurtrie, proprietor of the Abbotsford Hotel at Lady- 
smith, has been in the hotel business for a number of years, and is one of 
the best known and most effi.cient hotel directors in the province. The 
quasi-public position of landlord is, when the reputation of a town with the 
outside world is considered, the most important office that anyone can take 
upon himself, and a capable performance of the duties involved means in- 
estimable advantage to the welfare of the town, inasmuch as the community 
is judged progressive or backward according to the character of public en- 
tertainment afforded travelers. 

The Abbotsford landlord was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, April 26, 
1861, being a son of James and Margaret McNeill (Bryden) McMurtrie, 
the parents still living in Scotland. After a public school education in Scot- 
land which continued only through his early boyhood years, Mr. McMurtrie 
became an apprentice to the gardening and horticulture business, and worked 
at that for seven years. In 1882, being then of age, he came to the United 
States, where for several following years he was engaged in railroading and 
mining. In 1886 he came to Wellington, British Columbia, and after several 
years spent in mining started a men's furnishing and clothing store, which he 
successfully conducted for three years until he sold out to enter the hotel 
business. In 1894 he built the Abbotsford Hotel at Wellington, at a cost of 
eighteen thousand dollars, and in 1900 moved the entire establishment to 
Ladysmith, where he made alterations and repairs to the building so that its 



540 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

valuation is now thirty thousand dollars. The Abbotsford is a credit to the 
town and the province, it is conducted as a first-class public house, has all 
modern equipments and conveniences, is noted for the excellence of its 
cuisine, and has a steady and profitable patronage from the best elements 
of the traveling public. It covers a ground space of one hundred and fifty 
by one hundred and thirty-six feet, and contains thirty-six bedrooms. 

Mr. McMurtrie served as mayor of the town of Wellington during 1898 
and 1899. Fraternally he is affiliated with St. John's Lodge No. 21, A. F. 
&amp; A. M. ; Vancouver Commandery, K. T., and with Geiza Temple of the 
Mystic Shrine. He was married in 1888 to Miss Edna Wall, a daughter of 
Thomas Wall, of Wellington. Of the four children born of this happy union 
two are living. Thomas Ernest and Ian Maclaren. 

PETER LAMONT. 

Peter Lamont, a prominent representative of mercantile interests in Nel- 
son, is numbered among the pioneer settlers of the northwest of 1883 and the 
history of the early development of this portion of the province would be in- 
complete without the record of this gentleman who from the period of its 
early development has been a prominent factor in advancing its substantial 
growth. When the Kootenay district was cut off from the advantages and 
comforts of the east by the great forest tracts and the high mountains, he 
made his way across the country, braving all the trials and hardships of 
frontier life in order to make a home in the northwest, rich in its resources, yet 
unclaimed from the dominion of the red men. 

Mr. Lamont was born on Prince Edward's Island in January, 1861, his 
parents being Peter and Catherine (McKenzie) Lamont. His father is now 
deceased, but the mother is still living, her home being yet on Prince Edward's 
Island. 

To the grammar schools of his native locality Peter Lamont is indebted 
for the early educational privileges he enjoyed. He afterward worked for 
a mercantile firm in New Brunswick, with whom he remained for three years 
and then came to Regina in the northwest territory in 1883. He recognized 
that this country had before it a splendid future, that its opportunities were 
vast, that it contained splendid natural resources and that business conditions 
were bound to improve it and business opportunities to increase. He there- 
fore became a dealer in stationery and continued in that line for thirteen years, 
when he organized a company in connection with Mr. Martin, and the Martin, 
Lamont Company was thus formed. They opened a stock of drugs and sta- 
tionery and were at Regina for one year. Mr. Lamont then organized the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 541 

Canada Drug &amp; Book Company and took two other stores there. At the same 
time he opened stores in Revelstoke and Nelson. The company now operates 
two stores in Nelson. On the ist of August, 1904, they amalgamated with 
the Bole Drug Company, wholesale dealers in drugs, with warehouses at 
Winnipeg and Calgary, the head office in the wholesale department being in 
Winnipeg. Under the capable management of Mr. Lament the business has 
constantly grown in volume and importance and has now reached extensive 
and profitable proportions. 

In 1898 Mr. Lamont wedded Miss Mary Thom, a daughter of James 
Thom of Russell, Manitoba. He is a member of the Ancient Order of For- 
esters and of the Knights of Pythias fraternity, and he belongs to the Presby- 
terian church. Twenty-one years have come and gone since he arrived in 
the northwest territories and throughout the intervening period he has been 
a prominent factor in the advancement of the commercial interests, upon 
which the growth and prosperity of village or city always depends. Widely 
and favorably known, his life history cannot fail to prove of interest to his 
many friends, and it is therefore with pleasure that we present his record to 
our readers. 

HON. SIMEON DUCK. 

Hon. Simeon Duck, w^ho arrived in British Columbia as long ago as 
1859, has been identified with the manufacturing business and political 
affairs of Victoria for many years, and has been and still is an influence 
working continually for the development and general welfare of his city 
and provirice. His career is worthy of the high esteem in which he is held, 
and his life history brings out one more of the strong characters who have 
had so much to do with the actual making of Victoria and with its perma- 
nent progress. 

Mr. Duck is a native of St. Catharines, Ontario, having been born De- 
cember I, 1834, so that he is now a man just turned into his seventies and 
yet still active and vigorous in the conduct of his business affairs. He is 
of good English ancestry. His parents, William and Mary (Jackson) Duck, 
were both born in England, and about 1833 emigrated to New York, Will- 
iam Duck was thoroughly loyal to his king, and he decided to come under, 
the flag of his native land and accordingly moved to Canada. He secured 
a farm near St. Catharines and resided there the rest of his life. He attained 
the ripe old age of eighty-seven years, and his good wife likewise lived past 
the biblical age of three score and ten, being seventy-five years old at the 



542 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

time of her death. They were the parents of seven children, four sons and 
three daughters, and four of them still survive. 

Mr. Simeon Duck is the only member of the family in British Colum- 
bia. He was reared in his native town of St. Catharines, where he received 
his early education. He also learned the trade of wagon and carriage maker. 
About 1858 the new's of the gold discoveries in British Columbia reached him 
and attracted him to this land of supposedly golden opportunity. He came 
around by the Panama route and on the 21st of July, 1859, arrived in Vic- 
toria, being then in his twenty-fifth year and strong and vigorous. He 
went up to the Fraser river and tried his luck at mining, first at Hope and 
then at Yale. Although gold was not so plentiful as his fertile imagination 
had pictured it, there was nevertheless no danger of starving, since the river 
was full of the splendid salmon. And upon one occasion when crossing the 
river two large fish were caught on one spear by just driving it at random 
down into the river. The principal diet of the men at the time was fish and 
beans. Mr. Duck took a claim on Hill's Bar, which he worked most of the 
summer, but did not make expenses. When he started from Victoria to the 
Fraser river he had sixty dollars, but returned empty-handed. When he 
was once more back in Victoria he began working at his trade, and he has 
the distinction of being the first wagon and carriage maker in the city. In 
order to make lumber for the first wagon he cut oak trees and whip-sawed 
them, and from this material the first, wheeled vehicle made in Victoria was 
manufactured. Mr. Duck also made the first wagon to run on the Cariboo 
road. This wagon was purchased by Mr. F. J. Barnard for his express busi- 
ness between Yale and Cariboo. 

During his first years in Victoria there was not much demand for 
wagons, but when the wagon road w-as opened through to Cariboo the de- 
mand increased and Mr. Duck supplied most of the wagons used in those 
early times. His business rapidly expanded into a general blacksmith and 
carriage and wagon shop, and he did all kinds of work along these lines. 
This business continued for nearly twenty years, and he reaped a well earned 
success. 

In 1878 Mr. Duck returned to Ontario to visit his parents and the 
home of his youth, and on arriving once more at Victoria he again entered 
into business. In politics he has always been a Conservative, but entirely 
moderate in his views, believing more in principle than party. He took an 
active interest in the Canadian confederation movement, and after that had 
been accomplished he was elected a member of the first local legislature. 
At the next general election he again stood but was defeated. In 1882 he 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 543 

was returned by the electors of Victoria to the local assembly as an inde- 
pendent, and was very active in the legislative enactments of that time and 
had the honor of holding the ofifice of minister of finance in the Smyth 
cabinet. During the time Mr. Duck was a member of the cabinet he suc- 
ceeded in obtaining for the city of Victoria what were then known as the 
James Bay mud fiats and upon which now is being erected the palatial hotel 
of the C. P. R. He also obtained a transfer of the Mount Douglas Reserve 
to the city of Victoria for public park purposes. 

Soon after its organization Mr. Duck became a member of the Victoria 
volunteer fire department, and continued his active connection therewith for 
twenty years, holding all the positions in the department up to chief engineer. 
In October, 1865,, Mr. Duck received the sublime degree of Master Mason, 
and for many years was a very active member of the order, having filled 
all the offices up to and including that of master of the lodge. He also had 
the honor of being the grand master of the grand lodge of the province in 
1874-1875, and such was his proficiency and devotion to the w^ork that the 
order has conferred upon him several tokens of appreciation of w^hich he 
is very proud. He has also been connected with the Ancient Order of United 
Workmen for the past twenty years. 

May II, 1865, Mr. Duck was happily married to Mrs. Sarah Miller, 
who is a native of the state of Ohio and a daughter of Mr. Peter Haught. 
She is a pioneer of Texas. California and British Columbia. Mr. and Mrs. 
Duck have one son, William Duck, who is a native son of Victoria and is a 
barrister at law. 

Mr. and Mrs. Duck have a pleasant home on Herald street where they 
have resided during the last thirty-five years. 

ROBERT MONTAGU BIRD. 

Robert Montagu Bird, interested with his brother, Harry Bird, in the 
real estate, insurance and mining business of Nelson and the Kootenay dis- 
trict, is a native of England, his birth having occurred in Cheltenham, on 
the loth of January, 1863. He was educated in Clifton college and after 
leaving school accepted a position with the land agent on Lxjrd Ducie's estate 
in Gloucestershire. There he remained for a year, after which he went 
to Cornwall, where he was articled to the Redruth Brewing Company of 
Redruth, learning the brewing trade and winning promotion as his efficiency 
increased until he became head brewer. He remained there for three years 
and in 1884 '^c went to Canada, settling in the Moose mountain district. There 
; with Captain Pierce he established a store and in 1899 he came to British 



644 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Columbia with his brother. They have since been associated in the conduct 
of a real estate, insurance and mining business and through the many invest- 
ments which they have placed they have contributed in substantial manner 
to the growth and upbuilding of this portion of the country. 

In 1885 Mr. Bird v/as united in marriage to Miss Mabel Shaw Page, 
a daughter of Rev. Shaw Page, of Selsley Vicarage near Stroud in Glouces- 
tershire. They have one son, Montagu Herbert. The parents are members 
of the Church of England, and their sterling traits of heart and mind have 
endeared them to many friends during their residence in Nelson. 

ALFRED ST. GEORGE HAMERSLEY, K. C. 

Alfred St. George Hamersley, city solicitor of Vancouver, occupying a 
leading position at the bar, was born in Oxfordshire, England, on the 8th 
of October, 1848. He is descended from English and Irish ancestors, the 
line of descent being traced back to the time of King Richard, III. Sir Hugh 
Hamersley, Lord Mayor of London in the third year of Charles First's reign, 
the progenitor of the family in England, as far as is known, resided in that 
county as early as 1625. Hugh Hamersley, esquire, father of A. St. G. 
Hamersley, was chairman of the court of quarter sessions and deputy lieu- 
tenant of the county of Oxfordshire for many years. He married Miss Ann 
Phillips, an English lady belonging to the well known St. George family. 
They were members of the Church of England, prominent in the social and 
political circles of their part of the country. 

Alfred St. George Hamersley, the only representative of the family 
in British Columbia, acquired his education in Marlborough College and his 
later education at the Middle Temple, London. He emigrated to New 
Zealand in 1874, there remaining until 1887, when he returned to England 
and the following year he came to Vancouver. He had heard favorable 
reports of the advantages of this city and became imbued with the idea that 
it had a splendid future before it. He therefore determined to locate here 
and make the city his home and the field for the practice of his profession. 
Becoming a member of the bar of British Columbia he has attained a dis- 
tinguished position in connection with the practice of law. In 1890 he was 
appointed city solicitor, which position he has since held. Mr. Hamersley 
gives special attention to municipal law, in' which he has secured a good 
clientage. He has cornprehensive and thorough understanding of the prin- 
ciples of jurisprudence, and in the preparation of his cases displays great 
fairness and exactness, while in the presentation of his case before the court 
he is forcible, his deductions following in logical sequence.

BRITISH COLUMBIA 545 

In early life Mr. Hamersley was deeply interested in athletics and at 
football played four international matches on the English team and was 
captain of the all England team. He has also rowed at Henley and various 
regattas and has won many cups. While in New Zealand he was the founder 
of the Rugby football and played for New Zealand for several years. He 
also had command of a battalion in New Zealand during the trouble with 
the native Maoris, and was made colonel of artillery in the New Zealand 
militia. 

In 1876 Mr. Hamersley was married to Miss Maud Snow, of Dorset- 
shire, England, and they have three sons and two daughters, namely : Hugh 
St. George, now a captain in the Royal Artillery ; Constance, at home ; Harold 
St. George, a lieutenant in the Imperial army; Maud, at school, and Alfred 
St. George, also a student. They occupy a beautiful residence in North Van- 
couver and are identified with the Church of England, belonging to Christ's 
church. Mr. Hamersley is president of the Brockton Point Amateur 
Athletic Club. He is a member of the Masonic fraternity and has made many 
friends during his residence in Vancouver. His is a well rounded character 
not so abnormally developed as to become a genius in any line, but so evenly 
balanced that his judgment is rarely at fault, and his views of life in all these 
relations are at once rational, practical and progressive. A favorite socially 
and a success professionally, he stands today as one of the leading men and 
lawyers of his adopted city. 

WILLIAM JAMES WHITESIDE. 

William James Whiteside, a leading representative of the bar at New 
Westminster, has been an active member of his profession for the past fif- 
teen years, all of which time has been spent in this province. Born and 
reared on a farm, he has depended on his own resources and ability since 
he was a boy, working his way into the profession by his own efforts, so 
that the success which has crowned his subsequent endeavors and placed him 
in the front ranks of the legal talent of British Columbia has indeed been 
well deserved. 

Mr. Whiteside was born in 1864 at Scarboro, Ontario, a son of Thomas 
and Jane (McCowan) Whiteside, his father a native of Ontario and his 
mother a native of Scotland. His father was an industrious farmer at Scar- 
boro, and the son while growing up got a good training at farm labor, ^e 
also attended the public schools of his district, and the collegiate institute at 
Toronto. On leaving school at the age of seventeen he became a teacher, 
and for the following three years provided for himself and made a little 



546 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

money in that occupation. He then took up the study of law at Toronto, 
and in 1886 came to British Columbia and at New Westminster continued 
his studies with T. C. Atkinson, obtaining admission to the bar in 1890. 
In 1 89 1 he formed a partnership with F. W. Howay, and after two years 
went in with Corbculd and the late Chief Justice McColl. This relationship 
lasted for two years, and then in 1895 he formed a partnership with Hon. 
Richard McBride, present premier of British Columbia. For a i^eriod of 
six years beginning with 1896 he practiced at Rossland, after which he re- 
turned to New Westminster. He was a partner of Hon. Aulay Morrison 
until the latter's elevation to the supreme bench of the province in 1904. 
Mr. Whiteside has a large and representative clientage, and he is acknowl- 
edged throughout the province as one of its able lawyers. Politically he 
supports the Liberal party and principles. 

In 1893 Mr. Whiteside married Miss Margaret Dalglish, of Ottawa, 
a daughter oi James Dalglish. They have six children, Marjorie, Gordon, 
Jean, Ellen, James and John. 

AULAY MacAULAY MORRISON. 

Aulay MacAulay Morrison, judge of the supreme court of British 
Columbia, has been a prominent member of the bar of British Columbia 
for the past fifteen years, during which time he has been honored with 
several high offices of trust, and in the year just past was elevated to the 
supreme bench, which his eminent abilities as a jurist will dignify and in 
which position he can render the highest civic service to his fellow citizens. 

Judge Morrison was born in 1863, at Baddeck, Nova Scotia. He is 
of good Scotch parentage and lineage, his parents, Christopher and Flora 
MacAulay Morrison, being natives of Scotland and of old. family con-

Nova Scotia, and he began and continued practice at Halifax until 1890. 
Since the latter year he has been a resident of British Columbia. Immedi- 
ately on his admission to the bar of this province he entered a partnership 
at 'New Westminster with the Hon. Judge Forin, present county court judge 
of the Kootenay district, and with Captain Alexander Boyd, whose father 
is Chancellor Boyd of Ontario, and who later died in South Africa. At 
the general election of 1896 Mr. Morrison was elected to the house of 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 547

ALFRED POOLE, M. D. 

Alfred Poole, M. D., one of the leading physicians and surgeons of 
Vancouver, has been located in practice at this city since 1894, and his 
ability and thorough experience and skill have placed him in the front rank 
of the profession.

GEORGE ADAMS. 

George Adams, the leading grocer and prominent in public afifairs and 
fraternal circles of New Westminster, has been a resident of the city for 
the past fifteen years, and most of his career has been worked out in this 
province. He is a man of self -achievement, having begun his connection 
with practical affairs when still a boy, and relying on his own energy and 
abiHty for his success. 



548 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. Adams was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in January, 1866. His 
worthy Scotch ancestors resided for some generations at Drumoak, Scot- 
land, where were born both his parents, William and Barbara (Coutts) 
Adams. A grammar school education in Scotland sufficed him for his edu- 
cational equipment, and at the age of fourteen he left school to become an 
apprentice at the grocer's business. After five or six years' service in this 
trade he came to Canada, in 1885, and during the following five years con- 
ducted a grocery at Burks Falls, Muskoka county, Ontario. He came to 
British Columbia in 1890, and at New Westminster engaged in the grocery 
business, which he has since built up to be one of the leading houses of the 
kind in the city. 

Mr. Adams had been in the city only a few years when he became a 
factor in public affairs, his public spirit and civic worth being manifested in 
various ways. In 1895 he was elected a member of the city school board, 
and served thereon three years. He was chosen for a seat in the city council 
in 1900, and has been re-elected every subsequent year, including 1905. Po- 
litically a Liberal, although actively interested in local, provincial and Do- 
minion politics, he has never sought office, and performs his part in a quiet

tario, and they have three sons, Lloyd Leverne, James Clifford and George 
Eden. 

JOHN ROPER HULL. 

John Roper Hull, of Kamloops, is a well known and extensive stock- 
man of that vicinity, and has for a number of years been engaged in this 
industry on a remarkably large scale. He is also entitled to distinction as 
being one of the old-time citizens of this part of British Columbia, having 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 549 

arrived before the advent of railroads and having been closely identified with 
provincial business and industrial affairs for more than thirty years. 

An Englishman by birth and early training, he was born July 14, 1855, 
and his parents, Arthur Davie and Honor (Berry) Hull, are both deceased. 
Educated in an academic institute in Bridport, Dorset, England, he spent 
his youth in his native land, and in 1873, being then in his eighteenth year, 
he came out to British Columbia, which has since remained as the field of 
his endeavors and life career. He came out to this province to join his 
uncle, W. J. Roper, who had already for several years been located at Kam- 
loops. From the beginning of his residence in the province Mr. Hull has 
been interested, in a constantly increasing extent, in the stock business, and 
so successful has he been in the conduct of his industry that his annual 
product will now aggregate almost as high as any other individual cattle- 
man's in the province. Up to June i, 1894, he was proprietor of a meat 
market in Kamloops, but at that date he sold out to P. Burns &amp; Company. 
At the present writing he controls, by ownership and lease, about twenty 
thousand acres of land near Kamloops, and on this large acreage about two 
thousand cattle are '* nm " each year. Mr. Hull is a believer in high-grade 
stock, and only that kind will be found on his ranch. Shorthorns and Here- 
fords make up the bulk of his cattle, and he also raises a number of thorough- 
bred Percheron, Clydesdale and Cleveland Bay horses. He also has ex- 
tensive mining interests, and is an acknowledged leader among the business 
and industrial magnates of the Yale district. 

ALEXANDER D. MACINTYRE. 

Alexander D. Macintyre, member of the bar at Kamloops, has been 
engaged in active practice for twenty years, and since located in British 
Columbia has gained high recognition for his ability in the profession, espe- 
cially in criminal causes, and is prominent and highly esteemed both person- 
ally and professionally. 

Mr. Macintyre was born in Manilla, Ontario, February 21, 1856. His 
father, Rev. Alexander Macintyre, a minister in the Baptist church, is now 
living at Toronto Junction, but his mother, Margaret Sinclair (Macarthur) 
Macintyre, is deceased. Mr. Macintyre's early educational equipment was 
obatined partly in the graded and high schools and partly at home and under 
private tuition at Toronto. He studied la[w with Beattie, Hamilton &amp; Cas- 
sels of Toronto, and was admitted to the bar in August, 1884. The first 
nine years of his practice were in Collingwood, Simcoe county, Ontario, 
and during six years of that period he held the office of license commis- 



550 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

sioner. From Collingwood he located for practice at Toronto, and while 
there, in 1895, was made chief clerk of the revision of the statutes, involving 
duties which he discharged for two years and a half. Mr. Macintyre came 
to Kamloops in 1898, and in the following year was admitted and has been 
busily engaged in practice up to the present. In 1900 he was appointed 
official administrator for intestate estates and judge of the court of revision 
of the assessment roll. In addition to his legal work he is interested in 
mining in this district. 

Mr. Macintyre belongs to the Sons of Scotland, in politics is a mem- 
ber of the Liberal party, and his religious affiliation is with the Church 
of England. 

WILLIAM J. PENDRAY. 

William J. Pendray, of Victoria, has the largest and best equipped fac- 
tories for the manufacture of paint and soap in British Columbia. Mr. 
Pendray is a man of enterprise and such energy as always marks the man 
who builds up an important institution of whatever character. He has been 
acquainted with the western and northwest coast for many years, and from 
a somewhat varied business activity in earlier years finally turned his atten- 
tion to the manufacture of soap, which he has carried out not only with 
success to himself but also as an enterprise which adds much to the material 
prosperity and stability of the city of his choice. 

Mr. Pendray is a native of England, having been born in Cornwall, 
August 15, 1848. He came of a good, honest and industrious English fam- 
ily, and for his own part has been hard-working and earnest since he was 
a boy in age. He was educated in England; and in 1868 emigrated to 
California by way of the Isthmus of Panama. From the Pacific coast metrop- 
olis he went to the mines of Grass valley, and worked there for eight months 
at three dollars a day.- In the following year he went to Cariboo to the 
mines on Mosquito creek, and there became one of the lucky owners of the 
Willow and Minnehaha mines. The Willow turned out to be one of the 
richest diggings in that vicinity, and Mr. Pendray did so well that after a 
time he returned to England. 

He remained in his native country but three years, and then returned 
to the Occident and this time located at Virginia City, Nevada, where are 
located the famous Comstock lodes that made San Francisco rich. He was 
there when the California Bank failed and brought disaster to hundreds, but 
he was fortunate in getting out all his money. In 1875 Mr. Pendray came 
to Victoria with the intention of engaging in some permanent line of busi-

ness that would prove profitable. He had an uncle, W. J. Jeffrie, in the 
city, who was in the clothing business, but Mr. Pendray had no knowledge 
of this line of trade and it did not appeal to him. One day when he was 
out walking about the town he passed a soap factory which had been closed 
since the death of its owner. He considered this an opportunity, and after 
counseling with his uncle and Mr. Thomas Earle, a prominent wholesale 
merchant of the city, he rented the vacant establishment and with one man 
to help him at the start he began the manufacture of soap. However, he was 
full of ambition and energy, and pushed the enterprise so well that it rapidly 
expanded in capacity and production. He now has forty-five employes in 
this department of his business, and his factory building of brick and wood 
is one hundred and thirty-five feet deep and fronts five hundred and thirty- 
five feet on Hubolt street. In this structure he has all the latest appliances 
for the manufacture of soap, and besides laundry and fancy toilet soaps he 
also makes washing soda and bluing. There is an eighty-horse power steam 
engine to furnish power for his plant, and he has all the machinery for the 
grinding and mixing of paints, and he turns out all the standard colors of 
paint. He has a power printing press on which all the labels for his goods 
are printed. Also, his paint cans and buckets are all made in his own tin 
shop, and in his box factory are made all the wooden boxes needed for his 
products, besides a large output of paper boxes sold to the wholesale houses 
of the city. He uses nothing but the very best labor-saving machinery, and 
liis entire plant is a model of its kind. Nearly all the crude materials are 
made up into their finished form on his own premises. The oil is boiled on 
the place, and among the products are also putty and varnish. A number of 
salesmen are constantly on the road pushing the sale of these products to the 
consumers and the jobbing trade, and the high standard of the goods is best 
indicated by the fact that the demand is constant and equal to the supply, 
the trade extending not only over British Columbia but along the entire 
northwest coast and into the Klondike. 

May 23, 1877, Mr. Pendray was happily married to Miss Amelia Jane 
Carthew, a daughter of the late Captain John Carthew, of Cornwall, Eng- 
land. Mr. and Mrs. Pendray have four sons, who have already displayed 
the energy and ability characteristic of their father in business affairs. Ern- 
est Carthew, the eldest, is foreman in the soap factory; John Carroll is 
manager in the paint factory; Herbert is foreman in the paint works; and 
Roy is still in school. The sons are valuable adjuncts to their father in the 
business, and their ability insures the same successful conduct of affairs in 
the future as has marked the past. Mr. Pendray is a member of the Ma- 



552 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

sonic and Odd Fellows fraternities, and he and his wife are Methodists. The 
family is well known in Victoria, and the success of their business enter- 
prises and the individual worth of the members are enduring assets in the 
economic and social wealth of the city. 

JOHN THOMAS ROBINSON. 

John Thomas Robinson has been for some years past a prominent factor 
in the journalistic, business, political and general activities of the city of 
Kamloops, and in all this wide range of occupation he has been found emi- 
nently useful, progressive and public-spirited. Naturally a man of. broad 
capability, of great energy, and of invincible integrity of character, he has 
prosecuted his career with an unusual amount of success and at a com- 
paratively early age has taken a leading position among his fellow citizens. 

He was bom in Elma township, county Perth, Ontario, seven miles 
from the town of Listowell, on May 24, 1868, and his parents, Alexander and 
Elizabeth (McQuillan) Robinson, are both still living, their home being in 
Cannington, Ontario. The future editor's early training was accomplished in 
the school at Britton's Corners in Elma township, then at the Gordon school 
on the township line, followed up with a graded and high school course in 
Listowell. During his school days his physical energies found ample outlet 
in the work of the home farm, and when his scholastic career came to a close 
at the age of fourteen he entered the Standard printing house in Listowell, 
and during a four years' apprenticeship learned all the details of the trade 
besides gaining more or less acquaintance with journalistic work. For two 
years he was on the staff of the Cannington Gleaner and of the Orillia News 
Letter. In 1888 he and his brother, W. A., purchased the Ontario Gleaner 
at Cannington, and continued as one of the editors and publishers of that 
sheet until the fall of 1896, when he sold his interest to his brother. Octo- 
ber I, 1896, he purchased the Berlin, Ontario, Daily News, which, however, 
he conducted only a few months, and in the following February sold out and 
came west. Since then he has been located at Kamloops, where in 1897 he 
organized the Standard Printing and Publishing Company of Kamloops, 
and was part owner and managing director of the concern for a year and a 
half. In 1899 he left the newspaper business, and since that date has con- 
tributed his energies to the business activity of Kamloops as a broker and 
dealer in real estate and in the mining business. 

Mr. Robinson is well known in the political and military circles of the 
northwest. As a staunch Conservative he acted as organizer for the whole 
province, and for three years was a member of the executive committee of 




)&gt; 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 553 

the Conservative Union. On two occasions he has been brought before a 
convention as candidate for the house of commons — the first time being- only 
twenty-one years old, being proposed as a member from North Ontario, an 
offer which he declined, and in 1904 was a candidate for the Yale-Cariboo 
riding, but was defeated in the convention. During 1904 he was a member 
of the city council, and is now a candidate for mayor. For five years Mr. 
Robinson held the commission of lieutenant in the Thirty-fourth Battalion of 
Canada Militia, this being during his residence in Cannington. In 1893 he 
was graduated from the Royal Canadian Military School at Toronto. 

For two years Mr. Robinson served as president of the Kamloops Board 
of Trade, and at the present writing is a member of the city council. He is 
the principal shareholder and is secretary of the Tenderfoot Mining Com- 
pany. Fraternally he is affiliated with Tatnai lodge. No. 9, I. O. O. F., at 
Kamloops, and with the Independent Order of Foresters, Court Gold Hills, 
at the same place. 

June 9, 1897, he was married to Miss Maggie S. Thorold, youngest 
daughter of Dr. F. E. Thorold, formerly of Cannington, Ontario, now a 
resident of Evansville, Indiana state. Mr. and Mrs. Robinson have two 
children, Hermance Charity Elizabeth and Nellie Frances Millicent. 

ANDREW HASLAM. 

Bom in the north of Ireland in 1846, a son of John Haslam, Andrew 
Haslam received his education in his native country, and in 1861 he crossed 
the ocean and located in New Brunswick. The first nine years of his career 
on the American continent were spent in farming and lumbering. In 1870 
he started for Manitoba, but it was a year before he arrived at his destina- 
tion, since he employed himself at various occupations at the different stages 
of his journey. In Manitoba he followed the lumber industry, working 
there for two years in lumber yards, and the two subsequent years were 
spent in the lumber business in the state of Texas. In 1874 he came out to 
British Columbia, where his business career has been identified with the 
lumber industry, and thirty years of citizenship makes him an old-timer. 
After working in some lumber yards for a time he came to Nanaimo in 
November, 1875, and for two years was employed in a lumber mill. He 
then moved to New Westminster, and for six years was a partner in the 
Royal City Planing Mill Company, at the end of which time he returned to 
Nanaimo and has since made this city his permanent home. He established 
a lumber and planing mill, known as the Nanaimo Saw &amp; Planing mill. 

In 1884 Mr. Haslam married Miss Eva Macdougal, whose father was 



554 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Charles Macdougal, of Carlton county, New Brunswick. Tliree children 
have been born into their happy home, namely, Charles, William and Ian. 
Mr. Haslam affiliates with Doric Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., and is a Conservative 
in political principles and has ser\'ed a term in both the provincial and Do- 
minion houses, being elected by acclamation to both, as the representative 
of Vancouver Island district to the Dominion house, and from the Nanaimo 
district for the provincial. 

EDWARD CHARLES ARTHUR, M. D. 

Dr. Edward Charles Arthur, successfully engaged in the practice of 
medicine in Nelson and also identified with mining interests of the northwest, 
was born in Prince Edward county, Ontario, November 29, 1856. His 
parents, Matthew and Margaret (Dougherty) Arthur, were early residents 
of Brighton, Northumberland county, Ontario. The father was a farmer 
and still lives upon his farm in that district, although he has practically re- 
tired from active business life. 

Dr. Edward Charles Arthur at the usual age began his education, en- 
tering the public school No. 12 in the township of Hallowell in Prince Ed- 
ward county. He afterward spent four months as a student in public school 
No. 6 and eventually entered the high school at Brighton. Later he matricu- 
lated in Victoria University, entering that institution in September, 1876, 
and completing a full classical course there by graduation in May, 1880. 
Devoting his attention tO' educational work he spent several years in teaching 
in high schools and collegiate institutes, when having determined to enter 
upon the practice of medicine he began preparation for that work in Trinity 
Medical College of Toronto, in which he was graduated in May, 1888. 
Entering upon practice at Lloydtown in county York, he remained there 
for fifteen months, after which he came to British Columbia to accept the 
position of physician for the Canadian Pacific Railway on the Columbia and 
Kootenay road. He landed at Revelstoke on the 30th of April, 1890, and 
arrived in Nelson on the 12th of August, of the same year. Locating for 
practice here in January, 1891, he was licensed in May following and has since 
continued an active representative of the medical fraternity, discharging his 
professional duties in a most conscientious, earnest and capable manner. He 
has gained comprehensive knowledge of the principles of the medical science, 
is rarely at error in his diagnosis of a case or in determining the outcome of 
disease and ever maintains a high standard of professional ethics. He is 
likewise largely interested in mining in addition to his professional duties, 
having made judicious investments in some valuable mineral properties. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 655 

On the 31st of July, 1889, Dr. Arthur was united in marriage to Miss 
Isabel Delmage, a native of St. Marys, Ontario, and they have one child, 
Margaret Isabel Lennox, while two of their children have passed away. Dr. 
Arthur is quite prominent in fraternal circles. He is a charter member of 
Nelson lodge, No. 23, A. F. &amp; A. M., and of Kootenay lodge, No. 16, I. O. O. 
F. He is serving as past grand master of the latter, is a member of the 
Independent Order of Foresters, and takes an active and commendable in- 
terest in every movement or measure that tends to promote the social, in- 
tllecutal or moral development of his city. His devotion to the general good 
has been recognized by his fellow citizens, who have called him to public of- 
fice. He has been coroner of the district since 1892, was alderman for one 
year and has been a member of the school board since its organization. In 
thought and feeling he is a fellow citizen of the province and his career is 
now closely identified with the history of the Kootenay district, where he. 
has acquired a competency and where he is an honored and respected citizen. 

RICHARD HALL, M. L. A. 

Richard Hall is a native of the Golden state, his birth occurring in San 
Francisco April 30, 1855, his parents being Richard and Sarah (Dunderdale) 
Hall, both natives of Lancashire, England. He received his educational 
training in Victoria, where he attended the Catholic College, and was also 
a student in the collegiate school of the Church of England. At an early 
age he was connected with the dry goods trade, was also in the wholesale 
commission business, and for a number of years was a steamboat purser. 
In 1882 Mr. Hall embarked in the wholesale coal trade, in which he has ever 
since continued, being exclusive agent for the Dunsmere coal, and in addition 
is also a well known insurance man, representing as general agent the Liver- 
pool, London and Globe, the Travelers' Life for the past twenty years, 
and also does a marine insurance business. It will thus be seen that he is a 
man of resourceful ability, and besides the many interests already mentioned 
it should be noted that the sealing business has also claimed a share of his 
attention, having been a member of the Victoria Sealing Company since 
1888, in which he is connected with Captains Cox and Grant, and is now 
serving as president of the company. In his political affiliations Mr. Hall 
was a Conservati\'e until 1896, but in that year joined the Liberals, and in 
1898 was elected a member of the provincial parliament, to which position 
he was re-elected in 1900 and again in 1903, administering the affairs of 
the office with ability and power. 

The marriage of Mr. Hall was celebrated in 1887, when Miss Louisa 



656 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Kinsman became his wife. She is a native daughter of Victoria, in which 
city her father, Aldermjin John Kinsman, has long made his home. The 
children born to this union are Rupert C, Norman B., and Claudia L. The 
family are Methodists in their religious faith, and fraternally Mr. Hall af- 
filiates with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Woodmen of the 
World, and is a member of the Sons of England. 

DAVID LA BAU, M. D. 

Dr. David LaBau, the pioneer physician of Nelson, whose practice largely 
extends over the eastern section of British Columbia, was born in Stoutsburg, 
New Jersey, on the 4th of March, 1858, his parents being David and Eliza- 
beth (Wert) LaBau. The mother has passed away, but the father is still 
living, being a resident of New Jersey. 

In the public schools David LaBau acquired his early education and 
afterward entered Columbia University in New York city, pursuing a course 
in medicine. He was graduated from that institution with the class of 1880 
and thinking that he might have a better field for professional labor in the 
west he made his way to Colville, Washington, where he spent a short time. 
He was afterward located in Idaho for a brief period and thence came to 
British Columbia in March, 1888, his destination being Nelson. He made 
his way to this district in order to engage in mining, for gold had been dis- 
covered in the Kootenay country and he hoped that he might more rapidly 
realize wealth than through the avenue of medical practice. There was no 
physician in the district, however, and he was constantly called upon to re- 
lieve the sick and suffering, in fact, the professional demands upon his time 
were so great that he was not able to attend to his mining interests, and de- 
termined to devote his energies exclusively to the practice of medicine and 
surgery. He was the first physician in the district and he has always main- 
tained a foremost place among the representatives of the medical fraternity 
here. He now has a large and lucrative practice, covering nearly all of the 
eastern portion of British Columbia. He has made a close and earnest study 
of surgery and his marked capability in that direction has gained him an 
enviable reputation throughout the province. He is also a registered 
physician of the United States. Constant study, reading and investigation 
have continually broadened his knowledge and promoted his efficiency and 
his skill in the alleviation of human suft'ering has brought him a desirable 
financial success. 

In 1896 was celebrated the marriage of Dr. LaBau and Miss . Maude 
Scott, a native of Portland, Oregon, and a cousin of Harvey Scott, editor 







■--ii/ti^ aU^'^°^ 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 557 

and proprietor of the Portland Orcgonian. They now have one child, Donna. 
Dr. LaBau is a prominent Mason, having taken the Knight Templar degrees 
as a member of Rossland Commandery, while he is also identified with the 
Mystic Shrine. He is likewise a member of the Knights of Pythias frater- 
nity. His entire freedom from ostentation or self laudation combined with 
liis genuine personal worth has made him one of the most popular citizens 
of Nelson and the Kootenay country, with whose history he has now been 
long and prominently identified. 

WILLIAM FREDERICK DRYSDALE, M. D. 

Dr. William Frederick Drysdale, a popular and successful physician and 
surgeon at Nanaimo, where he has been building up and caring for a rep- 
resentative practice during the past ten years, is generally recognized as a 
man of broad ability and high attainments in his profession, and has added 
to these qualifications a large degree of native talent and a large sympathy 
with mankind, so that he has succeeded as a matter of course and as the re- 
sult of his persevering and conscientious endeavor to realize high and worthy 
ideals. 

Born in Packenham, Ontario, October 24, 1867, both of his parents, 
Alexander and Martha (O'Neill) Drysdale, being deceased, the son, being 
the youngest in a family of eight children, w^as educated in the public schools 
and in the Collegiate Institute at Perth. That well known seat of medical 
learning, McGill University, was the source from which he acquired his 
professional preparation, and he was graduated from that institution with the 
class of 1894. This period of theoretical study w^as corrolx^rated with six 
months of practical experience in the general hospital. In September, 1894, 
he came to Nanaimo and established himself in practice asi a partner w'ith 
Dr. McKenzie, and this- firm has since been one of the most reliable in the 
city. Dr. Drysdale's practice is mainly of a general nature, but he has also 
made a specialty' of skin diseases, and has become reputed as an authority in 
this line. He has several professional connections, being a member of the 
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, a member of the British 
Columbia Medical Association, and is city. health officer of Nanaimo. 

Dr. Drv'sdale married, in April, 1900, Miss Katherine Allen, a daughter 
of Captain Allen of the ship Cuba.. They have one child, Jean Allen. The 
Presbyterian church represents the family's religious adherence. In politics 
Dr. Drysdale is a Liberal, and has ifraternal affiliations wnth Doric Lodge, 
A. F. &amp;' A. M., of which he is past master, and with Vancouver Commandery 
of the Knights Templar.

WILLIAM T. SLAVIN. 

William T. Slavin, postmaster of Kamloops, has been a popular and 
highly esteemed citizen of this city for the past fifteen years. He has arrived 
at his present position as a result of energetic and persistent effort, and he 
has made for himself since beginning in the time of youth a real career, char- 
acterized by efficiency in the performance of duties and by invincible integrity 
in all the relations of life. 

The present postmaster of Kamloops was born in Kingston, Ontario, in 
October, i860, being a son of P. and Rosanna (Keenan) Slavin, who are 
both deceased. Kingston remained only his brief childhood home, and it was 
at Montreal where he gained most of his school education and was reared. 
He also attended Masson College at Terre Bonne. He began learning tel- 
egraphy while a boy, and he practiced that art almost continuously up to the 
time of accepting his present office. In 1882 he moved to Winnipeg and be- 
came telegraph operator for the Canadian Pacific, and as that road was con- 
structed westward he followed along in its course until it was completed. 
He then worked for the Dominion Telegraph Company at Cariboo for four 
years, from 1886 to 1890, and in the latter year came to Kamloops, where for 
eight years he was stationed as commercial operator for the Canadian Pacific, 
with a book and stationery store in connection therewith. He was appointed 
postmaster of Kamloops in 1898, and has since filled that office to the eminent 
satisfaction of all concerned, and it can be said to his credit that numerous 
improvements effected during his administration have added to the efficiency 
of the service and his own popularity as a government official. 

Mr. Slavin was married in August, 1891, to Miss Margaret R. Dallas, 
a daughter of Donald Dallas, of Wick, Scotland. Mr. and Mrs. Slavin have 
three children, Dallas, Zellah and Patuce. Mr. Slavin is a member of the 
International Order of Railway Telegraphers, and is a past grand chancellor 
of Primrose Lodge No. 20, Knights of Pythias, at Kamloops. 

BELVILLE TOMKINS. 

Belville Tbmkins, proprietor of the Strathcona Hotel at Nelson, one ot 
the best hostelries in the province of British Columbia, was born in New York 
city, January i, 1852, and is a son of Charles M. T. and Jane (Hudson) 
Tomkins, both of whom have departed this life. At the usual age Belville 
Tomkins entered the public schools of New York and therein mastered the 
common branches of English learning, after which he entered upon his busi- 
ness career in a printing establishment. Later he was engaged in seafaring 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 559 

life for a time and in 1891 he came to British Columbia. He then located 
at Nelson and was identified with the steamship interests until he turned his 
attention to the hotel business. He is now proprietor of the Strathcona 
Hotel at the corner of Stanley and Victoria streets, one of the finest hostelries 
in British Columbia. It was erected in 1889 by employes of the Canadian 
Pacific Railway Company, and was opened as a hotel by E. E. Fair, who con- 
ducted it until January i, 1903, when he was succeeded by A. Padmore, who 
remained proprietor until March, 1903, when Mr. Tomkins took charge. He 
has since conducted the hotel and is one of the most popular landlords ot 
the province, owing to his earnest efforts to please his patrons and the many 
comforts and conveniences which the hotel affords. It contains sixty rooms 
and is heated by steam and hot air. It is a four story building, erected at a 
cost of twenty-four thousand dollars. The lots have a frontage of four 
hundred feet and a depth of one hundred feet. The hotel occupies a very 
favorable situation commanding a beautiful view of the mountain and the 
lake. 

In 1893 Mr. Tomkins was married to Miss Margaret Hutchinson, a 
native of California, and thus the year is a notable one in his history, for 11 
was also in that year that he entered the hotel business here. He is dis- 
tinctively American in spirit and actions, possessing the marked enterprise 
and foresight which have been the dominant factors in the rapid settlement, 
improvement and development of this great western hemisphere. He pos- 
sesses marked individuality, strong resolution and reliability, and he is en- 
rolled among the best citizens of the Kootenay district. 

DR. ARTHUR PERCIVAL PROCTOR. 

Dr. Arthur Percival Proctor, a physician and surgeon with extensive 
practice of an official and private nature, has been located in Kamloops since 
1898. Dr. Proctor is from first to last a man of evident ability and high 
purpose, and during the period of his active practice he has gained a reputa- 
tion for skill and adroitness which fits well with his place among the leaders 
of his profession in this province. He is prominently connected with the 
life and active affairs of the community, and is influential and highly esteemed 
wherever known. 

Dr. Proctor was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, England, July 28, 1867,

as is his mother, Ellen (Livesey) Proctor. Educated in the schools of the 
old country, in 1886, l^eing then an ambitious youth of nineteen, he came 
out to Canada and located at Alberni on Vancouver Island. Some time 



660 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

later he made definite plans for a medical career, and his professional studies, 
begun in the famous McGill University, were finished in Manitoba Uni- 
versity, where he was graduated with the class of 1896. He then became 
professionally connected with the Canadian Pacific Railway, and in the em- 
ploy of the company was located at Donald, British Columbia, for sixteen 
months. In the spring of 1898 he came to Kamloops, where he has cen- 
tered his private and official practice ever since. He carries on a large gen- 
eral practice, and is also local physician for the Canadian Pacific. Dr. Proctor 
is a progressive member of his profession, and by several prominent official 
connections keeps in touch with the science and wields his own influence for 
the progress of the medical fraternity. He is a member and during 1904 
was president of the medical council of the province; is medical superintend- 
ent of the Royal Inland Hospital, is physician to the provincial jail and also 
to the provincial home, is provincial health officer for the district and is city 
health officer. He keeps up active membership in the British Medical Asso- 
ciation, the Canadian Medical Association, and the British Columbia Medical 
Association. 

In politics Dr. Proctor is a Liberal, and he and his family are Presby- 
terians. He is a prominent Mason, being affiliated with Kamloops lodge, 
A. F. &amp; A. M., and with the Scottish Rite Lodge of Perfection at Winnipeg; 
is also an Odd Fellow, with Tatnai lodge. No. 9. 

In 1900 Dr. Proctor niarried Miss Christine Mitchell, a daughter of 
Walter Mitchell, of Inverness, Scotland. They are the parents of two

LIEUT. COLONEL JOHN CONNAL WHYTE. 

Lieutenant Colonel John Connal Whyte, of New Westminster, officer 
commanding Sixth Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles, is the warden of the 
British Columbia Penitentiary. He came to the province in 1887, and is a 
native of Stirling. Scotland, born on the 2nd of August, 1861. His parents 
were Robert and Jean (Connal) Whyte, the former a native of Breco, Scot- 
land, and the latter of Stirling. The father was a contractor and builder, 
and both he and his wife were Presbyterians in religious faith. He attained 
the advanced age of eighty-two years, and his widow now survives him in 
the sixty-eighth year of her age. 

Lieutenant Colonel Whyte accompanied his parents to Canada when 
but two years of age, and was reared in Ottawa, supplementing his early 
educational privileges by study in the Ottawa Collegiate Institute. He began 
his business career in a wholesale dry goods establishment, and continued in 





^' A a 



BRITISH- COLUMBIA 561 

that until 1887, when he came to Victoria. There he remained for a short 
time, after which he removed to New Westminster. He was here superin- 
tendent of construction of the water works for the city, was superintendent 
of construction for the Revelstoke &amp; Arrow Lake, and the Nakusp &amp; Slocan 
Railways, and was thus closely associated with industries having direct benefit 
upon the material resources and improvement of the city and province. In 
1896 he was appointed warden of the British Columbia penitentiary, and 
since that time has had charge of the institution. In the intervening years 
many improvements have been made, and a large addition doubling the size 
of the institution is now being completed. There are in 1905 one hundred 
and thirty-seven convicts in the penitentiary, and these are employed in making 
boots and shoes, clothing, farming, blacksmithing, carpentering, baking; also 
in the manufacture of brick and artificial stone, the latter being made by an 
absorption process, and is moulded into any shape desired. It is stronger 
than sand stone and is a most valuable building material, and the British 
Columbia penitentiary has the honor of inaugurating this manufacture in the 
province. The convicts are also doing all the building under competent in- 
struction. Lieutenant Colonel Whyte has taken a deep interest in Penology, 
and has been honored with the appointment of Honorable Vice President of 
the National American Prison Congress. He has for many years been very 
active in field sports, and to him is due the honor of lueing one of the founders 
of the New Westminster Lacrosse Club. He has been a very successful and 
skillful player at all branches of amateur sport, and has twice represented 
the province of Ontario in the international football competition while resid- 
ing in Ottaw-a. 

Lieutenant Colonel Whyte has also had military interests and connec- 
tions. He w'as a member of the Forty-third Duke of Cornwall's Own Rifles, 
Ottawa, before coming to British Columbia, and in 1897 he was given a 
command in the Second Battalion, Fifth Regiment of Artillery in New West- 
minster. In 1899 this regiment became the Sixth Regiment Duke of Con- 
naught's Own Rifles, with headquarters in Vancouver. In 1902 Lieutenant 
Colonel Whyte was appointed to command of the Duke of Connaught's Own- 
Rifles. This regiment has acquired wide celebrity, and is second to none in 
efficiency in the rifle range. To this regiment belongs Private Perry, S. M., 
who at Bisley, England, in 1904 won the King's medal, the Victoria Cross 
of Riflemen, in competition against all the best shots in the empire. When 
Lord Dundonald was leaving Canada he sent a despatch to the Toronto World 
" That the Sixth was a very smart corps, and that their ofificers took a deep 
interest in rifle shooting." Lieutenant Colonel Whyte has for the past four 



562 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

years been president of the British Columbia Rifle Association, and they 
now have the best record of any provincial association, having won last year 
at Ottawa six places out of twenty on the Bisley team, of which four are out 
of his own regiment; he is also vice president of the Dominion of Canada 
Rifle Association and vice president of the Canadian Militia League. 

In 1889 Lieutenant Colonel Whyte returned to Ottawa and was mar- 
ried to Miss Margaret Blythe, a native of Ottawa and a daughter of George 
R. Blythe, Esquire. Their union has been blessed with six children : George, 
Isabella, Stewart, Blythe, Margaret and Jean. The parents belong to St. 
Andrew's Presbyterian church, and Lieutenant Colonel Whyte belongs to 
Union Lodge No. 10, A. F. &amp; A. M., of New Westminster. He is also an 
eighteenth degree Scottish Rite Mason; also is a member of the Ancient 
Order of United Workmen and the Sons of Scotland. He has a wide and 
favorable acquaintance in military and fraternal circles, and enjoys that warm 
personal regard which arises from geniality, a kindly spirit and deference for

JOHN CLANCY GORE. 

John Clancy Gore, who is serving as superintendent for the Canadian 
Pacific Railroad steamers at Nelson, was born in Gibraltar, Michigan, in 
1853 and after attending the public schools there he began learning the ship- 
builder's trade, which he followed, however, for only a few months. He 
afterward secured a position on steamers on the lakes, running on a mail 
boat on Lake Superior between Marquette, Houghton and Hancock. He 
was at that time but fifteen years of age. For four seasons he remained in 
that employ and then worked on ship construction. Up to the time he was 
eighteen years of age he had risen from the humble position of a deck hand 
to master of a tug, and he continued to serve in the latter capacity for two 
years. In 1872 he came west, locating in Portland, Oregon, his father hav- 
ing purchased land near that city. Mr. Gore then turned his attention to 
ranching, but the venture proved unsuccessful and he accepted a position as 
deck hand on the Willamette and Columbia river boats. His capability, 
however, won him promotion to the position of mate, which he occupied 
until 1884, when in a similar capacity he went up the Stickeen river. The 
boat on which he sailed, however, was sunk on the trip, and returning to 
Portland, Mr. Gore accepted a position on the government snag boat. He 
was next employed on the O. R. N. for one season as captain, following 
which he returned to the employ of the government on a snag boat. Later 
he resigned, however, on being offered a captaincy on the O. R. N. boat, and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 563 

he was in the employ of that company until September i, 1890, when he went 
to Revel stoke in the employ of the Kootenay Steam Navigation Company. 
It was owing to Captain Gore's long experience and practicability in navi- 
gating swift waters and treacherous currents that it was made possible to 
reach the inland Kootenays by navigation from outside points, thereby con- 
necting with S. F. &amp; N. on the south and the C. P. R. at Revelstoke. Prior 
to this navigation was closed six months during the year. In 1897 he located 
at Nelson and is now superintendent for the Canadian Pacific Railway Com- 
pany's lake and river service. 

In 1886 Mr. Gore wedded Miss Ida B. Ditmars, a resident of Oregon, 
and they have two children : Hazel and George. Fraternally Mr. Gore is 
connected with Nelson lodge, No. 23, A. F. &amp; A. M., and is true to the 
teachings and tenets of the craft. Starting out in life at an early age with 
no assistance from influential friends or favorable environments he has made 
good use of his opportunties and has gradually worked his way upward until 
he now occupies an important and lucrative position. 

RT. REV. EDWARD CRIDGE. 

Rt. Rev. Edward Cridge, the veuerable bishop of the Reformed Episco- 
pal church of British Colurhbia, has enjoyed a career in ecclesiastical service 
which for length and broad usefulness is seldom vouchsafed to men. With 
his eighty-seven years he is truly venerable, and yet as the Lord's vicar he 
still preaches and carries on his beneficent work among the people of Victoria, 
where he has been rector of the present congregation for more than thirty 
years. As might be expected in one who has toiled so long and faithfully, 
one finds a beautiful simplicity, a breadth and liberality of mind and outlook, 
and a sweet patience and steadfast courage as the most prominent marks of 
the bishop's character. The wholesomeness and uplifting marks of his life 
are happily still continued, and as the sunset of his career approaches the love 
and veneration of his people strengthen and hold with the greater tenacity 
to his supporting and beneficent spirit. 

Bishop Cridge was born in Bratton Fleming, Devonshire, December 17, 
181 7, being of good English lineage. His father, John Cridge, was an Eng- 
lish schoolmaster, and he married Miss Grace Dyer, who passed away when 
her son Edward was but a child. The father lived to be sixty-three years 
of age. 

Bishop Cridge enjoyed usual opportunities in an educational way under 
the direction of his father, and he also attended the schools of North Milton 
and South Milton. Fle afterw^ard was third master in the Grammar School, 



564 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Oundle, Northamptonshire. He finished his education in St. Peter's College, 
Cambridge, receiving the degree of B. A. In 1848 he passed the theological 
examination in Cambridge, and was ordained in Norfolk. He was appointed 
assistant curate of the church of North Walsham, Norfolk, and was also 
second master of the school in that city. In 1851 he was appointed to the 
charge of Christ District church at Westham, London. 

In 1854 Rev. Cridge was appointed chaplain of the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany for Vancouver Island. Before coming out to the wilderness of the 
northwest to assume his duties he was married, in 1854, in the parish church 
at Westham, to Miss Mary Winmill, who was born in England. They then 
came out together to the district church of Vancouver, and in April, 1855, 
landed at what is now the beautiful and prosperous city of Victoria. At 
that time the fur company's fort with its projecting bastions and with the 
surrounding cabins was the principal evidence of civilization in these parts. 
Until a church could be erected he held the first Episcopal services within 
the fort. The church was completed in 1856, was burned down in 1869, and 
was rebuilt by the congregation in 1872. Bishop Cridge was the first Protest- 
ant clergyman in this province, and besides holding regular services and 
Sunday school at Victoria he also carried on his ministerial work at Colwood, 
Esquimault and other places. In 1857 he visited Nanaimo and held services 
and baptized several Protestant children, and his was the first Protestant 
service held in that place. In 1859 he accompanied the Rev. Mr. Gammage, 
a missionary sent out by the Propagation Society, by steamer as far as Hope 
and thence by canoe as far as Yale, and across the mountains on horseback 
to Lytton, from there to Lillooet, and came home by way of Douglas. 

In 1874 the organization of the Reformed Episcopal church was effected 
in the Presbyterian church building on Humboldt street, and Rev. Cridge 
held the first service. Bishop Cummins was the leader of the movement by 
which this branch denomination was brought about. The reformers objected 
to certain changes made in the ritual of the older church, and it is claimed 
that the Reformed church is more in keeping with the creed and usages ot 
the church as it was originally, and they use the English prayerbook and dis- 
pense with many of the formal services that resemble the Roman Catholic 
ritual. In 1876 Rev. Cridge was consecrated bishop of the Reformed Episco- 
pal church at Ottawa, and later was sent in the deputation from that church 
to the Free church in England. The congregation at Victoria erected the 
Church of Our Lord in 1876, and this has been Bishop Cridge's home church 
ever since. 

The bishop and Mrs. Cridge have had nine children, and the four now 



BRITISH , COLUMBIA 565 

living are : Richard Coombe Cridge, who is a civil engineer in the Sandwich 
Islands; Mary Hills is the wife of James Cram, manager of the bank at 
Ashcroft ; Ellen is the wife of Thomas Herbert Laundy, in the Bank of Com- 
merce, and Maude is at home with her aged parents. Mrs. Cridge is still 
spared to her husband and children, and is one of the oldest pioneer women 
in the province. Besides being unwearied in church work, she was part 
founder, and, for twenty years, first lady directress of the still flourishing 
Protestant Orphans' Home. In 1875 Bishop Cridge built a very commodious 
and pleasant home on Carr street in Victoria, and this delightful place has 
been hallowed by his subsequent life and by the associations of a happy family. 
The grounds about the residence contain three acres, and the bishop has been 
so enthusiastic in his love for the spot that he has placed all the improvements 
upon it with his own hsinds. He has set out many fruit and ornamental trees 
and flowers. This home is called Marifield, in honor of Mrs. Cridge, whose 
first name is Mary. Bishop Cridge is a lover of music and since early life 
has been trained in the appreciation of the art. He is himself an accom- 
plished player on the 'cello. Some sixty years ago he was one of the or- 
ganizers of the Cambridge University Musical Society, and this is still in 
existence and a flourishing body continued in the interests of the best in 
music. The limits of this article of course preclude a more extended ac- 
count of the many phases of Bishop Cridge's long life, and it must be suf- 
ficient to conclude by saying that he has been devoted to the promotion of 
many worthy enterprises, that the progress of the world toward higher ideals 
has always found in him a sympathetic worker, that his influence for good 
has never become dimmed in the course of years, and that his humanizing 
spirit and beneficent endeavors have lifted thousands of his fellow men toward 
the better things of the world. 

CAPTAIN JOHN S. TAIT. 

Captain John S. Tait, a popular and prominent officer in the Sixth Regi- 
ment, Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles, and also one of the enterprising and 
prosperous business men of Vancouver, is a native of Edinburgh, Scotland, 
where his birth occurred on the 6th of June, 1875. The family had resided 
in Scotland through many generations. His father, James Tait, also a na- 
tive of Scotland, becarne a member of the firm of Tait &amp; Company, engaged 
in the growing and shipping of tea in China. He was the founder of the 
business and for a long period was very active in controlling its interests and 
extending the scope of its operations, his keen discrimination and capable 
management bringing to the firm a large measure of success. He died in 



^ 



566 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

1888, at the age of seventy-three years. His wife, who bore the maiden 
name of Annie Shaw Trotter, was a native of Scotland. She survives her 
husband and now resides in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the sixtieth year of her 
age. In religious faith they were Presbyterians, members of the Established 
church of Scotland. In their family were nine children who yet survive, 
while one has passed away. 

Captain Tait, the only member of the family in British Columbia, was 
educated in his native city and his first business interest was that of a shipping 
clerk in Leith. He came to Vancouver in 1897 to take charge of his present 
business as manager of the house of Crawford &amp; Stuart, wholesale dealers in 
ropes, cords, twines, patent salmon nets and all lines of fishing supplies, the 
business being located at No. 565 Granville street. Captain Tait has con- 
tinuously remained as manager and has conducted the business with very 
gratifying success for the past seven years. The store is a very large one 
and the stock is received direct from the manufacturers. He supplies the 
goods to the trade and to the fishers at very satisfactory rates and he is an 
active, honorable, progressive and conscientious business man, with whom 
it is a pleasure to meet in any commercial transaction, because of his obliging 
disposition and thorough reliability. 

In 1898 Captain Tait joined the militia, went through a school of in- 
struction and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Garrison Artillery, now 
the Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles. He was promoted to captain in 
January, 1902. Since becoming a member of the militia he has taken an 
active part in its development along lines of proficiency and superior skill. 
He is fond of rifle practice, is himself a fair marksman and is ever ready 
to lend efficient aid in all the undertakings of his company and regiment, 
serving capably on all the committees on which he is appointed and deserving 
and enjoying the high esteem of the regiment. Such men are a credit to 
the military organizations of the country. He also takes a lively interest 
in athletic sports, yet never neglects his business and in commercial, social 
and military circles he is prominent and popular. 

On the 19th of November, 1902, Captain Tait was united in marriage 
to Miss Lilian Nelson Moore, a native daughter of California, born in San 
Francisco, and of Irish-Canadian descent. They have one son, John Moore 
Spottiswood Tait. The captain and Mrs. Tait have won hosts of friends 
since their arrival in Vancouver, and his social as well as business and mili- 
tary prominence entitles him to recognition in this volume.

THOMAS TAYLOR. 

Thomas Taylor, of Revelstoke, has been prominently and closely identi- 
fied with the industrial, business and public affairs of interior British Colum- 
bia for a number of years. Of large ability as an executive and manager, 
personally influential, and of known integrity and worth of character, he has 
impressed his energy and enterprise on numerous departments of activity 
and has become well known throughout this portion of the province. 

A native of London, Ontario, where he was born February 4, 1865, his 
parents, Thomas and Anne (Talbot) Taylor, being both deceased, he was 
reared and educated in his native city, where he attended the graded and 
high schools, and was afterwards articled to the law firm of Taylor and 
Taylor for two years. In 1885, being then a youth of twenty years and full 
of ambition and energy, he moved to Winnipeg, where he employed himself 
at various occupations for three years, and since 1888 has been a citizen and 
an active factor in British Columbia He has been a resident of Revelstoke 
since 1900. In 1889 he went to Donald, British Columbia, in connection 
with the mechanical and store department of the Canadian Pacific Railway, 
and for one year had charge of the company's store at North Bend. He 
then took the management of the branch store of C. B. Hume and Company 
at Trout Lake City, and has been associated as a member with that firm 
ever since. From 1894 to 1898 he served as government agent. He has 
interests in mining in this district and coal lands in Alberta. 

Mr. Taylor is a Conserv^ative in politics, and has taken much interest 
in local affairs. In 1900 he was returned as a member of the provincial 
parliament for Revelstoke riding, and in 1903 was re-elected. He is prom- 
inent in fraternal circles, being affiliated with Trout Lake Lodge No. 49, 
Independent Order of Odd Fellows, with the Fraternal Order of Eagles at 
Revelstoke, with the Independent Order of Foresters, and is a member of 
the Orange Society. In 1897 he was married to Miss Georgie Larson, whose 
father was a native of Copenhagen, Denmark. They have three children, 
Thomas Talbot, Margaret Edna and Richard Gk)rdon. 

SAMUEL SEA, Sr. 

Samuel Sea, Sr., who in former years was extensively engaged in ship- 
building, and is now devoting his energies to agricultural pursuits, is num- 
bered among the pioneer settlers of Victoria of the year 1862. He was born 
in Kent, England, on the 12th of August, 1837, and his father, Samuel Sea, 
was also a native of that country and died in the seventieth year of his age. 



Ik 



568 . BRITISH COLUMBIA 

His wife, however, still survives and has now reached the advanced age of 
ninety-six years. They were the parents of three sons and five daughters 
and one of the sons, William, now resides in San Francisco, while another 
son, Henry Sea, is a resident of Victoria. In the year 1862, the discovery of 
gold in British Columbia attracted Samuel Sea of this review to the Pacific 
coast. He took passage on the sailing vessel Celestia, bound for the far 
northwest, and carrying two hundred and fifty passengers. One hundred 
and twenty-eight days were passed ere the voyage was completed. Mr. Sea 
had previously learned the ship-carpenter's trdde and after reaching British 
Columbia he was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company in the repairing 
of its ships. After the completion of the schooner Mink, however, he sued 
the company before he received his pay. He was likewise the builder of the 
following vessels, the Gold Stream, the sloop Deerfoot, the brig Robert 
Gowan, and others at Sooke. He made a trip to the Sandwich Islands, after- 
ward visited San Francisco and then returned to his home in England in 
order to visit his relatives and to wed the lady of his choice. He was married 
to Miss Louisa Lovell and they came to British Columbia by way of New York, 
the Isthmus of Panama and San Francisco, ultimately reaching their destina- 
tion, Victoria. 

Here Mr. Sea resumed his ship-building operations and at this period of 
his life constructed the steamer Woodside, and the schooner Cambria. His 
partner sailed in the latter vessel to the Sandwich Islands, but was killed by 
the Indians at Solomon Island and the ship and cargo were a complete loss. 
Mr. Sea also built a missionary boat, the Evangeline, for Bishop Ridley &amp; 
Company, in the ship building business for many years, but at length retired 
from that field of labor and purchased a farm on the Buniside Road, three 
miles from Victoria. He is now engaged in raising cattle, horses, hay and 
grain and in his agricultural pursuits is meeting with desirable and gratify- 
ing success. 

Unto Mr. and Mrs. Sea have been born four children, all of whom are 
living, namely : Samuel, now a prominent merchant of Victoria ; Elizabeth, 
the wife of John Turnbull; William Lovell, who is upon the farm with his 
father, and Alm.a, at home. Mr. Sea owns an excellent farm and pleasant 
home and he and his family have a wide circle of friends and acquaintances 
in Victoria and throughout the surrounding district. In politics he has al- 
ways been a Liberal, but has never sought or desired office. The family are 
connected with the Church of England and Mr. Sea holds membership rela- 
tions with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Ancient Order of 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 569 

United Workmen. Coming- to the far west in early manhood he found here 
the business opportunities which he sought and which have led to his pros- 
perity. 

ALEXANDER EDWARD GARRETT. 

Alexander Edward Garrett, a member of the law firm of Livingston &amp; 
Garrett, is a recognized leader in community affairs in Vancouver, now fill- 
ing the position of aldemian,. and his public-spiritedness and loyalty to the 
general good are manifest in tangible way through the aldermanic measures 
which he has instituted and supported, having direct bearing upon the sub- 
stantial growth or improvement of the city. 

Mr. Garrett was born in Hamilton, Ontario, on the i6th of September, 
1870, and is of Irish and Scotch lineage. His father, John Garrett, was 
born in Belfast, Ireland, and in 1852, bidding adieu to the Emerald Isle, 
crossed the Atlantic to Hamilton, Ontario, where he was married to Miss 
Jessie Bell, a native of Glasgow, Scotland. He was a wholesale boot and 
shoe dealer in Hamilton throughout his entire business career. They were 
the parents of six children, of whom five are living. The father died in 1879 
in the fifty-ninth year of his age and the mother departed this life in 1899, 
at the age of sixty-five years. Both were devoted members of the Presby- 
terian church, in which Mr. Garrett served as an elder, and their efforts con- 
tributed in substantial measure to the growth of the church and the extension 
of its influence. 

Alexander Edward Garrett was educated in Upper Canada College in 
Toronto and in Germany, where he pursued a two years' course of study. 
His literary education having been completed he began preparation for the 
bar, and was graduated from the Toronto Law school, successfully passing 
his examinations in 1894. He then began the practice of his chosen profes- 
sion in his native city in partnership with Stuart Livingston, with whom 
he is still associated. The firm of Livingston &amp; Garrett was formed and 
after being together for a time they became favorably impressed with the 
bright prospects before the young city of Vancouver. Mr. Garrett visited 
British Columbia and wvas so pleased with the city and its prospects that in 
October, 1898, he and his partner removed to Vancouver and entered upon 
what has been a most successful and constantly growing law practice, their 
clientage being now of a distinctively representative character. They have 
been connected with much of the most important litigation tried in the courts 
of this locality and in argnment have been found forceful and logical, while 



570 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

as counselors they have displayed wise judgment and intimate knowledge 
of the principles of jurisprudence. 

Mr. Garrett has always been a Conservative in politics and as the rep- 
resentative of that party was elected one of the aldermen of Vancouver in 
January, 1904. He has the honor of having polled the largest vote ever cast 
in ward No. i. He was made one of the police commissioners and has taken 
a very active part in securing the introduction of various new methods de- 
. signed to increase the efficiency of the Vancouver police force. He has also 
taken an active interest in their support and he loses no opportunity to favor 
every measure intended to make Vancouver the delightful city which it is 
today. He has displayed his faith in the city by making investment in realty 
here, and his co-operation can at all times be counted upon to foster any 
movement or further any measure calculated to benefit Vancouver. 

In 1896 Mr. Garrett was made a member of the Masonic fraternity in 
his native city and was serving as senior deacon of his lodge at the time of 
his removal to Vancouver. He is now affiliated with Cascade lodge, No. 12, 
A. F. &amp; A. M., being one of its worthy representatives. He is a young 
man of strong mentality and marked individuality and the strength of his 
purpose, his laudable ambition and his untiring diligence have secured for him 
a creditable position as a member of the bar, while his devotion to the gen- 
eral good has made him one of Vancouver's valued representatives. 

WILLIAM BRAID. 

William Braid, wholesale importer of teas, coffees, and spices, located 
in the Braid Granite Block on Hastings street in Vancouver, is a native of 
Edinburgh, Scotland, and a son of Andrew and Ivan (Davidson) Braid, 
both of whom were natives of Scotland. The father carried on merchandis- 
ing in Edinburgh for many years and he reached the very venerable age of 
ninety years, passing away in 1896, while his wife, who died in 1887, was 
sixty-seven years of age at the time of her demise. They were the parents of 
eight children, six of whom are living. 

The Braid family has no representative in British Columbia except 
William Braid of this review, who at the usual age became a public school 
student in Edinburgh. He remained a resident of his nati^ e land until 1874. 
when attracted by the business opportunities of the new world he bade adieu 
to friends and native country and sailed for Canada. He located at Hamil- 
ton, Ontario, and there entered the employ of the firm of Stewart &amp; Mc- 
Pherson, where his ability won him recognition that resulted in promotion 
from time to time and eventually be became a partner in the firm. He was 



I 






cy^(^ zT^T^^x^ 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 571 

associated with these gentlemen for eighteen years, when severing his busi- 
ness connections in Ontario he came to the Pacific coast, finding the country 
here in a state of modern progressive development. He opened his whole- 
sale house in this marvelous young metropolis of the west and established 
himself at his present location, building a fine granite business block fifty 
by eighty feet, five stories in height and basement. He is conducting busi- 
ness as a wholesale importer of teas, coflfees and spices, and he has his build- 
ing filled with these articles imported direct from the countries in which they 
are produced. His business has constantly grown until in extent it equals 
many a commercial enterprise of older cities. He employes sixteen men and 
sells his goods throughout the Northwest territory and as far east as Winni- 
peg. Braid's best cofifee has a wide reputation as one of the most superior 
articles in that line on the market. He now has, in 1904, four hundred tons 
of coffee in stock and has the most modern plant in all Canada. He can 
roast a ton of coffee every hour. He has made a thorough study of the 
business, watches carefully the market and by selling good goods at reason- 
able prices he has secured a patronage which is indeed well merited. He is 
also president of the British Columbia Distillery Company and president of 
the Vancouver Vinegar Works, and thus he has extended his efforts into 
fields of activity which have proven of direct and permanent good to the 
northwest. Twelve years have come and gone since he arrived in Vancouver. 
The town was then comparatively in its infancy and throughout the inter- 
vening period he has been a prominent factor in the advancement of the 
commercial interests, upon which the growth and prosperity of village or city 
always depend. Widely known his life history cannot fail to prove of in- 
terest to his many friends, and it is therefore with pleasure that we present 
his record to our readers. 

FRED FRASER. 

Fred Eraser, whose career in the public service has made him well known 
in interior British Columbia, has been almost continuously a resident of 
Revelstoke for the past twenty years, during the entire history of that town, 
and for the last seven or eight years has given his broad usefulness and effi- 
ciency to the management of public offices of trust. Mr. Eraser has been a 
very busy individual since boyhood, taking up active, self-supporting duties 
as soon as school days were over, and with the passing years and increasing 
age his value to himself and to the community has kept pace and his public- 
spirited and enterprising citizenship is a constant and dependable factor of 
progress in this section of the province. 



672 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Born in Kent, England, February 13, i860, Mr. Fraser suffered the 
loss at an early age of both parents, William and Sarah (Williams) Fraser, 
and when seven years old came out to Canada, in company with two aunts 
and an uncle. What few remaining years of irresponsible boyhood remained 
to him were spent in Quebec, where he attended public school and became 
acquainted with the essentials of industry and honest endeavor. After work- 
ing for a short time on an Ontario farm, in 1879 he took up railroading and 
went out to Manitoba. He was employed in bridge construction until 1896, 
when the road on which he was working was completed. He had arrived 
and taken up his residence at Revelstoke in 1885, ^^ which year the Canadian 
Pacific was completed to that point, and during the remainder of his rail- 
roading he was stationed here in charge of the bridge material. In 1897 he 
entered the public service, as mining recorder, and his efficiency has been 
so marked that numerous positions of trust have since been given him and his 
time is now entirely taken up with a multiplicity of public duties. At the 
present writing he holds the following offices : gold commissioner and govern- 
ment agent, assessor and collector, registrar of supreme court, stipendiary 
magistrate, clerk of the peace, registrar of deaths, births and marriages, assist- 
ant commissioner of lands and works, and inspector under the cattle act. 

In 1884 Mr. Fraser married Miss Katherine Bennett, a daughter of 
Arthur Bennett, of Perth, Ontario. Nine children have been bom to this 
happy union, named as follows : Sarah Edith, Mary Florence, William John, 
Cathleen, Claire, Beatrice, Fred, Jr., Arthur and Alexandra. Mr. Fraser 
affiliates with Kootenay Lodge No. 15, A. F. &amp; A. M., and he and his family 
belong to the Church of England. 

DAVID ROBERTSON. 

The great lumber industry of the northwest has been one of the chief 
sources of wealth and prosperity of the country leading directly to its up- 
building and settlement. It is of this line of activity that David Robertson 
is a representative, being the senior member of the firm of Robertson &amp; 
Hackett, manufacturers of lumber, shingles, doors and sash. Thus becom- 
ing an active factor in industrial circles it is imperative that consideration be 
given him in a history devoted to the representative men of the province and 
in an analyzation of his character there are found many elements worthy of 
high commendation and admiration, notably his strict perseverance, unfalter- 
ing diligence and straightforward dealing. 

Mr. Robertson is a native of Fife, Scotland, born on the 28th of March, 
1850. and belongs to one of the old families of that land. His father, Alex- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 573 

ander Robertson, was born in the lowlands of Scotland and married Miss 
Jane Richie, also a native of that country. He was a millwright and in re- 
lig-ious faith they were Presbyterians, their lives being characterized by in- 
dustry and integrity so that they w-ere held in high respect throughout the 
community in which they resided. The father died in the seventy-fifth year 
of his age, while his wife, surviving him for a short period, passed away 
about the same age. 

David Robertson, having, acquired his literary education in the schools 
of his native country, afterward prepared for life's practical and responsible 
duties by learning the carpenter's and joiner's trade. He was an apprentice 
for five years, receiving eighteen pence per week at the beginning of his term 
of indenture, and at its close being paid a salary of three shillings and six 
pence per week. He then began work as a journeyman and was for fifteen 
years in the employ of Robert Neill &amp; Sons, large contractors and builders 
in Manchester, England. Desiring to do business on his own account, how- 
ever, and believing the great west to be a better field because of its livelier 
competition and advancement more quickly secured, he started for Vancou- 
ver in 1888. This city was then just coming into prominence and was being 
talked about in the industrial and commercial world, many recognizing that 
it was destined for rapid growth and marvelous achievement. The place 
attracted Mr. Robertson, and while upon the voyage he formed the acquaint- 
ance of a fellow passenger, James W. Hackett. Each learning the intention 
of the other to become factors in the business life of Vancouver they entered 
into a partnership relation which has since been amicably continued and has 
resulted in mutual and gratifying profit. Upon their arrival in the then, 
as now, growing city they at once engaged in contracting and building, 
erecting the first block at the corner of Hastings and Rogers streets. He 
also erected the Montreal Bank Building and the- Bank of British North 
America, together with many other of the fine business blocks of the city. 
Their building operations became so extensive that they w^ere induced to 
procure a factory to facilitate their work as contractors and builders, having 
always at their command the supplies needed for interior finishings. They 
thus became the owners of the mill on Granville street, w^hich they still own, 
and they have conducted their factory for the past nine years. It is located 
at the foot of Granville street on False creek and covers three blocks of land. 
Here they have a well equipped plant with a daily capacity of forty thousand 
feet of lumber and sixty thousand shingles every ten hours. They are also 
extensive manufacturers of sash, doors and all kinds of house finishing ma- 
terials and their business has reached extensive proportions, so that Mr. 



574 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Robertson has achieved the success the hope of gaining which led him to the 
new world. 

Mr. Robertson is past chief of the Sons of Scotland. He also belongs 
to the Society of St. Andrews and is its past president. He has the entire 
respect of the business community and the fact that the acquaintance formed 
between himself and his partner on the steamer has resulted in mutually 
pleasant business relations and the strongest friendship, speaks well of the 
ability and attractive personal qualities of each. 

Mr. Hackett was born in Nova Scotia on the 19th of October, 1849, ^^^ 
there learned the carpenter's trade. He spent several years in Boston and 
other parts of the United States and since coming to Vancouver has been 
classed with its stalwart and reliable business men. He has also been in- 
terested and active in community affairs, has filled the office of city alderman 
for two terms and does all in his power to promote general progress, but has 
no desire for further political preferment. He is a member of the Board of 
Trade. He was married in 1890 to Miss Anna Rice, a native of Frederick- 
ton, New Brunswick, and they have two children : George Robertson and 
Elsie Madaline. They have a good residence and Mr. Robertson has made 
his home with them since the partnership was inaugurated. Mr. Robertson 
as a member of the Cascade lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M. Mr. Hackett is also a 
member of the order. 

GEORGE E. GATES. 

George E. Gates, shipbuilder and the proprietor of the Gates shipyards 
and electric and marine railway which he established in 1896, was born in 
the state of Maine on the 6th of December, 1861. His father, Andrew J. 
Gates, also a native of Maine, was a lumberman and shipbuilder throughout 
his active business career. He still lives at the age of eighty years, while 
his wife is now in her seventy-fifth year. She bore the maiden name of 
Gatherine Kelly, and is also a native of the Pine Tree state. Both are mem- 
bers of the Roman Gatholic church. George E. Gates attended school for 
only a brief period, his education being largely acquired in the dear school of 
experience. He learned the shipbuilder's trade in New York city and when 
only nine years of age started out on his own account, since which time he 
has been entirely dependent upon his own labors. He certainly deserves 
great credit for the success which he has achieved and his life history con- 
tains many lessons that should serve as an incentive and source of inspiration 
to others. He was first employed on a schooner as cook. He occupied that 
position for three years and was then before the mast for two years. For 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 575 

three years he worked at the shipbuilder's trade in New York, and during 
the latter part of his service as an apprentice was paid twenty-four dollars 
per week. He had been in the shipyard not more than a year when he was 
made foreman, a fact which indicates the rapidity with which he had mas- 
tered the business and his efficiency in the trade. He also displayed marked 
executive force and his capability won recognition in rapid promotions and 
he found in each transition stage of his busines career opportunity for still 
further advancement. He continued at his business in Brooklyn, New York, 
until he came to Vancouver in 1896, the ill health of his wife causing his 
removal to the west. It was their intention to remain only three months, but 
she regained her health here and being pleased with the city and its prospects 
they decided to make Vancouver their permanent home. 

Four yars later, however, Mr. Gates was called upon to mourn the loss 
of his wife, who died from an attack of typhoid fever. They were married in 
1880, her maiden name being Miss Margaret Grimason, and for ten years 
they traveled life's journey happily together. At her death she left one son : 
Adrian, who is now attending college in Westminster. In 1902 Mr. Gates 
was again married, wedding Mrs. Isabella McLellan. There are two sons 
and a daughter by this marriage. 

Mr. Gates has met with very gratifying success in his shipbuilding in 
Vancouver. He built the steamship Bretania, a five hundred ton steamer^ 
finishing her complete and launching her, and she is now a popular passenger 
steamer. He also built the steamships Alice and Ghampion, and in the past 
eight years his work has amounted to three hundred thousand dollars, while 
employment has been furnished to as high as one hundred and twenty-five 
men at a time. He has also built many large scows one hundred and sixty 
feet in length for the Klondike. He has an electric plant of his own of five 
hundred horse power and in six minutes he can haul a two hundred and fifty 
ton steamer on the ways. Since coming to Vancouver he has invested in 
city property and is now building a handsome and commodious residence. 

Mr. Gates is a member of the Roman Gatholic church, to which he ren- 
ders large assistance by his liberal contributions. He is also interested in 
progressive measures for the city's benefit and his co-operation has been of 
value in promoting everything that has resulted in general good. Although 
a resident of Vancouver for but a comparatively brief period he has won for 
himself an honorable name and has acquired prosperitv through intelligent 
industrial efifort.

CHARLES ARTHUR WORSNOP. 

Lieutenant Colonel Charles Arthur Worsnop, surveyor of customs d 
Vancouver and one of the early settlers of the city, having arrived here in 
1887, has in the intervening years been an active participant in the splendid 
progress resulting in the phenomenal growth and upbuilding of the city. 
In military and civic life he has rendered valuable service to his country, mak- 
ing for himself a creditable record and is today a popular and prominent 
resident of Vancouver. 

Colonel Worsnop was born in Lancashire, England, on the i8th of 
October, 1858, and is descended from an old English family of Anglo-Danish 
origin, but for many generations had been represented in England. His 
father, Charles Barnett Worsnop, was born in England, and for a long 
period was connected with the department of Science and Art in the South 
Kensington museum. He married Miss Martha Bellhouse, a native of Eng- 
land, and both were members of the Church of England. The father died 
in 1883 at the age of fifty-nine years, while his wife departed this life in 
1888 at the age of fifty-five years. 

Colonel Worsnop was educated in London and in connection with the 
museum of Science and Art went to Philadelphia in 1876, taking charge of 
an exhibit at the Centennial Exposition. Interested in the new world and 
pleased with its advantages and opportunities he continued a resident of 
Pennsylvania until October, 1881, in which year he went to Winnipeg, where 
he embarked in the real estate business, dealing in property for himself and 
for others. From friends in Vancouver he received very favorable reports 
concerning the outlook of the city and its possibilities and he decided to come 
to the Pacific coast and ally his fortune with the embryo metropolis. Here 
he became the city editor of the Daily News Advertiser, and entering the 
Dominion civil service he became connected with the Vancouver custom house 
on the 1st of October. 1889, ^^^ was afterwartl appointed by the Dominion 
government surveyor of customs. This office he has since filled most satis- 
factorily, dicharging his duties with promptness and fidelity. 

In 1881 Colonel Worsnop joined the Winnipeg Field Battery of Artil- 
lery and in November, 1883, upon the formation of the Ninetieth Battalion of 
Winnipeg Rifles he joined that organization as" a lieutenant. In 1885 he was 
present with the regiment in the Northwest rebellion and participated in the 
engagement at Fish Creek and Batoche, also in the operations against Big 
Bear's band, and for his military service was awarded a medal and clasp. On 
the formation of garrison artillery at Vancouver in 1894 he was appointed 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 577 

captain and subsequently major, and on the 28th of May, 1897. was promoted 
to the rank of Heutenant colonel commanding the Second Battalion of the 
Fifth Regiment of Garrison Artillery. On the ist of July, 1889, ^^e battalion 
was changed to the Sixth Regiment Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles, and on 
the end of his term of command he was transferred to the reserve of of- 
ficers. During his continuance with the regiment he took a very great in- 
terest in its affairs and was a prominent factor in its growth, efficiency and 
prosperity, and such was his devotion to it during his early history that he 
justly earned the appellation of being the father of the regiment. He is held 
in high esteem by all its members and is yet very prominent and popular in 
military service. 

On the 22d of Octol^er, 1878, Colonel Worsnop was united in marriage 
to Miss Mary Benson, a daughter of the late Colonel Benson, of Peter- 
borough, Ontario. Colonel and Mrs. Worsnop had two sons, the elder, 
Charles Benson Worsnop, born August 5, 1879, is now a captain in the Duke 
of Connaught's Own Rifles. The second son, Lee Campbell, was born in 
February. 1881, and died on the 8th of September. 1899, in the eighteenth 
year of his age. Colonel Worsnop has throughout his residence in the Brit- 
ish provinces of the new world given his undivided attention to his official 
duties and the affairs of the regiment exclusive of all other business interests. 
He and his wife are adherents of the faith of the Presbyterian church. 

HUGH ARCHIBALD BROWN. 

Hugh Archibald Brown, cigar manufacturer, former merchant, and one 
of the foremost public-spirited citizens of Revelstoke, has, in the course of the 
fifteen past years, left his impress on numerous affairs in this portion of the 
province and has accomplished much for the upbuilding and the permanent 
welfare of the town of his choice. 

Mr. Brown is a Scotchman by birth and early rearing, and has shown 
the rugged qualities of his race during his business career. He was born in 
Dairy, Scotland, December 31, 1858, being a son of David and Elizabeth 
(Archibald) Brown, who are now both deceased. From attendance at the 
public schools and at Irving Academy he passed to more* practical duties 
and learned the engineering business. For eight years he was manager 
of his father's paper-box factory in Scotland, and at an early age demon- 
strated his capacity to assume large responsibility in the direction of busi- 
ness enterprises. Coming out to Winnipeg in 1880, he was for the following 
three years engaged in mining in Ontario, from 1883 to 1886 was engaged 
in various enterprises at Winnipeg, and then went on a trip to the States 



I 



578 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

for one year. In 1887 he went to the coast and for the following twelve- 
month was located in that part of the province. In 1889 he entered the 
service of the Canadian Pacific Railway at Revelstoke, and has ever since 
been more or less closely identified with this town. He personally conducted 
a hotel for ten years, at the end of which time he leased it to other parties, but 
two days after resigning the enterprise the hotel was burned down. He then 
built a block of buildings which still form a substantial part of the town, 
and established a general merchandise store, which he conducted with much 
success until he turned it over to his son and started the cigar factoi"y which 
he is still running and to which he gives much of his business attention. He 
is also interested in mining. 

In 1890 Mr. Brown married Elizabeth Knowles, a widow, who had two 
children by a former marriage. Mr. Brown affiliates with Gold Range Lodge 
No. 26, Knights of Pythias, and with the Fraternal Order of Eagles. He is 
a Liberal in politics. In 1903 his fellow citizens elected him mayor of Revel- 
stoke, and for four terms he served as president of the board of trade. He 
is lieutenant commander of Company No. 5, Rocky Mountain Rangers. His 
religious faith is Presbyterian. 

HENRY JOHN CAMBIE. 

Henry John Cambie, consulting engineer of the Canadian Pacific Rail- 
road, with residence in Vancouver, was born in county Tipperary, Ireland, 
and is the only member of a family of three sons and three daughters in 
British Columbia. He is descended from Huguenot ancestry that has been 
represented in Ireland through three centuries. His parents were Charles 
and Jane (Disney) Cambie, also natives of the Emerald Isle, in which coun- 
try they were reared and married. The year 1852 witnessed their emigra- 
tion to the new world. Mr. Cambie was for some years in the civil service 
of Canada. He died in 1867, at the age of sixty-seven years, and his wife's 
death occurred when she was in her sixty-fourth year. They were members 
of the Church of England and were people of high character worth, enjoying 
the respect of all with whom they were associated. 

Henry J. Cambie was educated in Leicester, England. He was born 
on the 25th of October, 1836, and was therefore about sixteen years of age 
at the time of the em.igration of his parents to the new world. He entered 
upon his business career in connection with engineering under Walter Shanly, 
of the Grand Trunk Railway system, and remained in that work for seven 
years. He then served for three years as a land surveyor in Ontario, and 
in 1864-5 he made surveys and exhibits for the Intercolonial, and in 1866 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 57li 

he followed his profession of engineering in Pictou, Nova Scotia, in connec- 
tion with the building of railroads for the coal mines. In 1867-8-9 he was 
engineer of the Windsor &amp; Annapolis Railway in Nova Scotia; and from 
1870 until 1873 he was in charge of w^rks on the Intercolonial Road. 

The year 1874 witnessed the arrival of Mr. Cambie in British Colum- 
bia. He came to take cliarge of a line from Nanaimo to Esquimault, which 
was offered to the province of British Columbia by Mr. Edgar as the rep- 
resentative of the McKenzie government. The offer, however, was refused 
by Mr. Walkem, then premier of the province. Mr. Cambie, in 1874-5, was 
engaged in the survey of the mainland of British Columbia to select a route 
for the Canadian Pacific Railroad, and from 1876 until 1879 he had charge 
of all the surveys in the province, and from 1880 until 1883 was in charge 
of the work of construction through the Fraser river canons. His next work, 
1884-5, was the superintendence of the construction for the railway com- 
pany from Savona's Ferry to Shuswap lake; while from 1886 until 1902 
he was engineer of the Pacific division of the Canadian Pacific Railroad. 
Since 1903 he has been retained in the company's service as consulting en- 
gineer on the main line from the summit of the Rockies westward and south 
from Kootenay lake. While engaged on the intercolonial and on the surveys 
of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, he worked under Sir Sandford Fleming, 
K. C. M. G. 

While in Nova Scotia, Mr. Cambie was happily married to Miss Helen 
E. Fay, a daughter of John B. Fay, of Halifax, and five children have been 
born unto them : Elizabeth M., now the wife of Hon. R. T. Tatlow, minister 
of finance for the province; Helen M. ; Henry B., who is in the Bank of Mon- 
treal ; Ida J. ; and Geraldine F. The family is one held in high esteem in 
Vancouver, .where they have hosts of warm friends. They are members 
of the Church of England. Mr. Cambie holds membership in Cascade 
lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M. His life w'ork has been of an important character, 
for no other single line of endeavxDr has such direct and important bearing 
upon the settlement and improvement of any locality as railroad construction, 
whereby a district is brought into direct communication with the outside 
world, furnishing a market as well as a source of supply. In this direction 
Mr. Cambie has rendered signal service to his fellowmen, especially in Brit- 
ish Columbia, and he has now a comfortable home in Vancouver in which 
to spend the evening of life, when he shall have put aside its more active 
business cares and arduous responsibilities.

CHARLES A. GODSON. 

The development of Vancouver has been so rapid as to partake almost 
of the nature of the marvelous. Within a few years it has emerged from • 
small beginnings to metropolitan proportions through the establishment of 
large commercial and industrial enterprises and thus her real founders and 
builders are those who have inaugurated and controlled her business inter- 
ests. To this class belongs Charles A. Godson, a member of the firm of 
Robertson, Godson Company, Limited, of Vancouver, connected with the 
James Robertson Company, Limited, of Montreal, Toronto, St. John and 
Winnipeg, manufacturing lead pipe, brass goods, etc., and dealers in metals, 
iron pipe, plumbers' supplies, etc. This firm is the largest of its kind in 
Canada. 

Mr. Godson is a native of Toronto, Canada, born on the 14th of May, 
1868. He is descended from loyalists of English ancestry. His father, 
Thomas Godson, was born in Cambridge, England, and married Miss Mar- 
garet Hutty, a native of Canada. He has been connected with the whole- 
sale business for many years, and still takes an active interest. Both he and 
his wife hold membership in the Church of England. 

The only member of their family in British Columbia is Charles A. 
Godson, who was educated in Toronto, and in 1889 came to British Co- 
lumbia, passing through Vancouver and settling at Victoria. There he en- 
gaged in the commission business as manufacturers' agent and dealer in 
other branches of hardware. In 1898, however, he returned to Vancouver, 
to establish the James Robertson Company, Limited, a branch of the Mon- 
treal house, and this business he conducted until it was merged into that 
of the present company. In this undertaking he has met with most gratify- 
ing success and is now in control of the largest enterprise of the character 
in the province of British Columbia and west of Toronto. He devotes all 
of his attention to this business, having no other commercial or industrial 
interests and his close application, unfaltering energy, keen discrimination 
and foresight have been the salient features in the prosperity which has 
attended it. 

In 1900 Mr. Godson was united in marriage to Miss Annetta May Sea- 
brook, a daughter of Rhodes Seabrook, vice-president of the R. P. Rithet 
Company. Limited, of Victoria. Mr. and Mrs. Godson hold membership 
Avith the Church of England and he is a member of the Independent Order 
of Odd Fellows. He is connected with the Vancouver board of trade and 
takes an active interest in promoting .the welfare and upbuilding of Van- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 58 L 

couver and the province. His business career has been notable for its suc- 
cess and the straightforward methods he has followed, and illustrates clearly 
the possibilities and opportunities which the province offers to her citizens. 

JOHN HOWE CARLISLE. 

Perhaps no representative of the official service of Vancouver is more 
entitled to the trust, respect and confidence of his fellow townsmen than is 
John Howe Carlisle, chief of the fire department. He arrived in this city 
in 1886, just before the great fire which completely destroyed the little town. 
A forest fire occurred, sweeping down upon the embryo metropolis and all of 
the efforts of the few inhabitants were unable to check it, so that only one 
building was left standing. Mr. Carlisle, therefore, has witnessed the entire de- 
velopment and growth of the present city, taking just pride in what has been 
accomplished and contributing his full share to the general improvement. 
He is a native of Alberta county, New Brunswick, born on the 4th of No- 
vember, 1857, and is of Scotch and Irish ancestry. His father, Theodore 
Carlisle, was a native of Canada, while his grandfather, William Carlisle, 
was born in Scotland, and emigrated to New Brunswick at a very early day, 
settling on a tract of land in Alberta county, which he developed into a good 
farm. He was of Scotch Presbyterian faith and was a worthy resident of his 
community, actively associated with its material development and moral 
progress. 

Theodore Carlisle, born on the family homestead in Canada, devoted 
his entire life to agricultural pursuits, residing for many years in Nova Scotia. 
He married Miss Jane Russell, a native of Truro, Nova Scotia, and a descend- 
ant of the Howe family, long residents of America. Mr. Carlisle died in his 
sixtieth year, while his wife survived and passed away in the seventy-eighth 
year of her age. They held membership in the Baptist church, their lives 
being in consistent harmony with their professions. They were the parents 
of nine children, four of whom are living. 

John Howe Carlisle, the only member of the family in British Columbia, 
was educated in Hillboro, Alberta county, and was reared upon his father's 
farm, early becoming familiar with the duties and labors that fall to the lot 
of the agriculturist. He continued to reside under the parental roof until 
he came to Vancouver and the entire period of his manhood has been passed 
in this city, which Phoenix-like, has risen from the ashes of the fire that 
almost entirely swept it out in 1886. He has been always deeply interested 
in what has been accomplished here for permanent improvement and sub- 
stantial development, and his aid and co-operation could always be counted 



582 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

upon for the support and championship of progressive measures. For three 
years he was engaged in trucking having his own team. In May, 1886, the 
volunteer fire department was organized and Mr. Carhsle became one of its 
original members, being connected with the hose department. In January, 
1887, he was made chief and has since ably filled this position. With the 
growth of the city he has wrought a revolution in the fire department of Van- 
couver, keeping in touch with the progressive spirit of the times and intro- 
ducing every modern device, the practical value and utility of which has been 
proven in fighting the flames.- In 1889 there was in the company eight full 
paid men and twelve call men. They now have thirty-five full paid men and 
the equipment comprises two engines, one a first class water engine, the other 
a third class Ronald engine. There is a seventy-five foot aerial truck and 
a village truck, three two-horse hose wagons, two chemical two-horse 
wagons, two combined two-horse hose and chemical wagons, fifteen fire halls 
distributed over the city in convenient localities, No. 2 being the principal 
one. It is located at No. 554 Seymour street, and was built and equipped at 
a cost of thirty-five thousand dollars. It is a modern structure, one of the 
best of its class on the Pacific coast and, indeed, is said to be the best fire hall 
in Canada, being supplied with every necessary convenience. Mr. Carlisle de- 
serves much credit for the planning of this splendid department. He has 
taken much pains to inform himself on the subject of fire halls and everything 
in connection with fire departments, and Vancouver has today a fire de- 
partment which has been developed under his management until the protec- 
tion of the city from fire is as near perfect as could be obtained. The fire 
department has had to fight several large conflagrations, and has in all cases 
shown its marked ability to cope with the fire fiend, its men acquitting them- 
selves with credit. He is calm and fearless in the face of danger, being 
thus enabled to direct the efforts of his men to the best advantage and to de- 
termine with marked celerity of action upon the best course to pursue. 

In 189 1 Mr. Carlisle was married to Miss Laura McCrae, who was born 
in Alberta county, New Brunswick, of Scotch ancestry. Their home has 
been blessed with seven children, all born in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
These are Dora Maria, Frank Russell, Ethel Jane, Keneth W., Walter, Ella 
and Verona. They have a nice residence at No. 1237 Robson street and they 
are members of the Baptist church, in which he is a trustee. He likewise 
belongs to Acacia lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., and Vancouver chapter, R. A. M., 
and enjoys the highest regard of his brethren of the craft. His splendid 
service in the connection with the fire department covering seventeen years 
as chief has made him one of the representative men of Vancouver. .

JOHN ABRAHAMSON. 

John Abrahamson, hotel proprietor and business man at Revelstoke and 
Trout Lake, has been identified with the interests of interior British Colum- 
bia for some twenty years, and is one of the best known, as well as one of the 
most successful, citizens of this part of the province. He is a hardy, energetic, 
first class business man and a public-spirited citizen, and is esteemed for his 
rugged honesty and personal worth. Having made his own way in the 
world since he was twelve or thirteen years old, he knows the meaning of 
self-help and personal application, and he has attained an honorable position 
in life by his own diligence and persevering efforts. 

Mr. Abrahamson is a native of Sweden, and has no doubt inherited much 
of his virility of character from his native race. Bom near Venersborg, De- 
cember 20, 1854, he was a son of Abraham and Christine (Anderson) Abra- 
hamson. His father is living in Revelstoke, but his mother is deceased. 
After an education in the public schools of Sweden, from which he received 
his certificate when twelve years old, he joined two of his brothers and went 
into the stone-cutting and bridge-building business, which he followed for 
eight years as a workman. He and his brothers, Charles and Andrew, then 
began contracting in the same line. In 1880 he came tO' the United States 
and after a short stay in Chicago went toi Minneapolis, where he was foreman 
in a mine. He took a contract for grading on the Canadian Pacific Railway 
at Winnipeg, and, continuing this business as the road was gradually extended 
westward, he finally reached the town of Revelstoke in 1885, at which place 
he made what has proved to be his permanent location. He started a hotel in 
this town with his brothers, Charles, Andrew and Noah, and in 1891, when 
they opened at Trout Lake, Andrew and Noah took over the management 
of " The Queens" at that city, while John and Charles remained at Revel- 
stoke, the brothers conducting the business in partnership, John being the 
manager of the firm, and has followed that line of activity ever since. In 
1891 he and his brother built a hotel at Trout Lake City, on the north end 
of Trout Lake, and they now conduct hotels at both places, the Central in 
Revelstoke and the Queen at Trout Lake. Prior to building the latter hostelry 
they had taken up the land where Trout Lake City now stands, and there 
laid out the townsite, since which time they have been actively identified with 
promoting the growth and prosperity of that town and have the satisfaction 
of seeing their plans maturing very successfully. They own the land adjoin- 
ing the townsite, and are also largely interested in mining in that locality. 
The Central Hotel is one of the finest public houses in interior British Colum- 



.

bia, being one hundred and ninety by one hundred and twenty feet in dimen- 
sions and three stories high, is well furnished and equipped with modern cor- 
veniences, and has been conducted along such liberal and up-to-date lines 
that it has been a credit to the town and served as the best advertisement 
abroad which Revelstoke could maintain. 

Mr. Abrahamson has been closely identified with social and public affairs. 
He affiliates with Gold Range Lodge No. 26, Knights of Pythias, and with 
Revelstoke Aerie No. 432, of the Fraternal Order of Eagles. A Liberal in 
politics and president of the local Liberal Association, he has served as coun- 
cilman of Revelstoke since its incorporation as a town in 1897, with the 
exception of two terms when he refused to run, and in 1900 he was appointed 
to the office of mayor, to fill the unexpired term of R. S. Smith. 

ALFRED WALLACE. 

Alfred Wallace, the leading representative of the ship-building inter- 
ests in Vancouver, was born in Davenport, England, on the nth of De- 
cember, 1866, and is descended from Scotch and English ancestry. His 
father, Samuel T. Wallace, also a native of England, was born in 1840, 
and has been engaged in the ship-building industry throughout his entire 
business career. He married Miss Jane Pope, who was born in 1843, ^^^ 
they are residents of Brixham, England. They hold membership with the 
Church of England and Mr. Wallace is prominent in his community, both so- 
cially and in business circles. 

Alfred Wallace, reared under the parental roof, acquired his education 
in the public schools and afterward learned the ship-builder's trade under 
the direction of his father, following that pursuit in England for seven 
years prior to his removal to the far west. He crossed the water to Canada 
in 1889 ^^'^^^ spent three years in Owensound, while the year 1890 witnessed 
his arrival in Vancouver. The city was then very insignificant compared 
with its present splendid proportions and modern improvements. 

Since his arrival in Vancouver the success which has attended the 
efforts of Mr. Wallace has been uniform and rapid and he has had no 
occasion to regret his determination to establish his home here. As a ship- 
builder he is well known. His yards are located in Vancouver at the foot 
of the Granville street bridge on False creek and he established his business 
at its present location in 1890 and has since had a large patronage in this 
line. In fact, he is recognized as the most important representative of ship- 
building interests in Vancouver. He was the builder of the steamer Albion, 
also the D. G. cruiser Kestrel and the St. George, the North Vancouver 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 585 

ferryboat and many others. He has bnih on an average of two hundred 
and thirty fishing" boats annually for eight consecutive years, and in 1903 
over four hundred and thirty, each boat costing about one hundred and 
ten dollars and such are his facilities for turning out work that he has 
completed fishing boats in two hours. He has a marine way in which he 
can take out two hundred and fifty tons dead weight in displacement. His 
work lD€ing of substantial character has secured him a large trade and the 
honorable business methods which he has followed has led patrons tO' recom- 
mend him to others and thus the volume of his business has steadily grown. 
In 1886 occurred the marriage of Mr. Wallace and Miss Eliza Eugene 
Underbill, a native of London, England. They have two children : Clarence 
and Herbert Alfred. They are members of the Methodist church and Mr. 
Wallace lD&lt;?longs to the Western Star Lodge, L O. O. F., and is a prominent 
Mason, holding membership in Mount Herman Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., of 
which he is now senior deacon ; in the Royal Arch chapter ; and in the Lodge 
of Perfection, having attained the fourteenth degree of the Scottish Rite. 
He has a good residence in Vancouver and the name and place which he 
has made for himself in business circles are such which he may be justly 
proud. 

JOHN HENRY ASHWELL. 

John Henry Ashwell, a prosperous and well known merchant of Chilli- 
wack, is a native son of British Columbia and during an active business 
career of something like twenty years has become one of the leading men 
of his town and district, known for his executive ability, his solid integrity 
and his public-spirited citizenship. He belongs to a family that has achieved 
much in the commercial affairs of New W^estminster district, and his father, 
George Randall Ashwell, an extended sketch of whom appears elsewhere in 
this work, has long been prominent in the affairs of the Chilliwack valley. 

Air. Ashwell was born in the city of New Westminster, October 5, 
1868, and when five years old accompanied his parents on their removal 
to Chilliwack. Completing the grammar school course, at the age of eleven 
he passed the second highest examination for high school in the province, 
two being tied for the second place. He continued his education in the 
Columbian Methodist College in New Westminster, where he took the full 
course and graduated at the age of eighteen. He then entered his father's 
store at the river landing near Chilliwack, and learned all the details of the 
business. In 1887 the business was moved into Chilliwack and the prop- 
erty purchased where the new store now stands, and since then the son has

assumed full management of the concern and built it up to the highest 
measure of commercial success. There is carried a stock valued at twenty- 
five thousand dollars, and the trade extends throughout the valley, with 
brai.ches at Sardis and Rosedale. The store building covers a space one 
hundred by forty-six feet, is two stories high, and has steel sidings. There 
are two warehouses for the reserve stock, and a most complete and well 
selected line of general merchandise can be found in the various depart- 
ments. 

Mr. Ashwell has taken a leading part in affairs pertaining to the social 
and public welfare of his community. He is secretary of Ionic Lodge No. 
19. A. F. &amp; A. M., and is past grand of Excelsior Lodge No. 7, I. O. O. F. 
Fie is president of the local board of trade, and is postmaster at Sardis. He 
and his family are Methodists. He was married December 15, 1892, to 
Miss Emma Maria Vickerson, a daughter of Edward Vickerson, formerly 
of Dtmdas, Ireland, now deceased. Three children have been born of this 
happy union, namely, Ewart Leslie, Iris and Sibyl. 

MILTON FLETCHER GILLANDERS. 

Milton Fletcher Gillanders, known throughout the ChilHwack as one 
of the most progressive and prosperous farmers of that region, was a pioneer 
agricultural settler of his locality, and during thirty years of capable and 
enterprising activity has gained an assured place in the industrial and civic 
affairs of his community, and is tmiversally respected and honored for the 
integrity and worth of his personal character and for his usefulness in every 
department of life where his energies are directed. 

He was born in Northumberland county, Ontario, in September, 1859, 
being a son of Donald and Margaret (Dawson) Gillanders, the former 
deceased, and the mother being a resident of Chilliwack. His education in 
the public schools of his native county alternated with work and rugged 
training on the home farm, and in 1873 he left home and came west to 
British Columbia. In the same year he located in Chilliwack valley, where 
he bought land from the government, there being comparatively few set- 
tlers in the neighborhood at the lime. He now owns one hundred and 
eighty acres, all of which is under cultivation, and his successful operations 
are directed to general farming, stock-raising and dairying. It is generally 
conceded that he has one of the best farms in the valley, and it has gained 
this reputation through his own progressive and thrifty enterprise in man- 
aging all his affairs on a profitable and up-to-date basis. The ranch is located 
about four miles from Chilliwack, and is a model in appearance as well as

in productivity and value. In stock-raising he makes a specialty of the 
Oxford Down sheep. Mr. Gillanders is held in high esteem among his fel- 
low agriculturists, and at the present writing is serving as president of the 
Farmers' Institute. 

Mr. Gillanders was married in t888 to Miss Matilda Maud Corry, a 
drughter of William Corry, of Ontario. Their three children are Alvin, 
Leah and Verna. Mr. Gillanders is a Conservative in politics, and he and 
his wife are Methodists. 

GEORGE ALAN KIRK.

and well known wholesale firm of Turner, Beeton and Company, Limited, one 
of the most prosperous and extensive houses in the wholesale district of the 
city of Victoria. This company are large importers of dry goods, and also

The trade of Turner, Beeton and Company extends throughout British Colum- 
bia and the entire Northwest Territory and fhe Yukon district. The stock- 
holders are all Englishmen, and Mr. J. H. Turner and Mr. R. A. L. Kirk 
still reside in the old country and give their personal attention to the pur- 
chase of the goods to be imported to this firm. The personnel of the firm is 
of the highest character and financial standing, and the business has been 
directed in such honorable and trustw'orthy manner as to deserve all the ex- 
cellent prosperity which has been its lot. 

Mr. George A. Kirk was born in Dover, England, March 8, 1870. He 
is of Scotch-Irish and English ancestry, and the Kirks are of old and hon- 
ored Highland stock. His grandfather w-as Captain Robert Kirk, who was

responsible for much of the present success of the firm. 

September 3, 1903, Mr. Kirk was happily married in Victoria to Miss

muir. Mr. and Mrs. Kirk adhere to the faith of the Church of England, and 
he is an active member of the Victoria board of trade and is always alert to 
the highest welfare and progress of his adopted city. 

DAVID R. KER. 

David R. Ker, one of the more prominent and successful business men 
of British Columbia, is a native son of Victoria. He was born October 2, 
1862, and is of Scotch ancestry, his parents, Robert and Jessie (Russell) 
Ker, being natives of Scotland. They were reared, educated and married 
in that country and in 1859 Robert Ker came to Victoria by way of the Pan- 
ama route, wishing to view the country and form for himself an opinion of 
the future possibilities of the country. Satisfied that it had a good business 
opening and that a bright future was before it, Mr. Ker sent for his wife 
in 1861 and she also came by the Panama route to join her husband in the 
new world. It was his intention to go to the mines in search of gold but 
he abandoned that plan on receiving an appointment with the Crown Colony 
in the treasury department, where lie rendered such satisfactory service that 
he was made auditor under the dominion government. He continued in that 
position until his death, which occurred February 12, 1879. In religious 
faith he was an Episcopalian and ere leaving his native land he had been made 
a member of the Masonic fraternity. His faithful wife, who shared with 
him in the pioneer experiences of the northwest, still survives him. They 
were the parents of four sons, two in Vancouver and two in Victoria, namely : 
Robert James, who is secretary of the British Columbia Packers Association; 
Thomas Arnot, who is manager of the B. &amp; K. mill in Victoria ; Walter Henry, 
who has charge of the large business of the house in Vancouver; and Dav- 
id R. 

The last named, profiting by the system of public instruction in Vic- 
toria, later attended the College School here, his brothers also being students 
with him. He prepared himself for a mercantile career but decided to learn 
the milling business and for that purpose worked several years in different 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 589 

mills in Victoria and in San Francisco, in order to gain practical knowledge 
of the business in every detail. From the latter city he returned to Vic- 
toria and entered into partnership with Mr. Brackman, who was the founder 
of the mill and business at Saanich. The business continued to increase under 
the joint management and control of Messrs. Ker and Brackman and in 
1886 they opened the warehouses and offices in Victoria, which has since 
been a center of their trade, Mr. Ker taking full charge of the business 
here. He has since developed a trade which in extent and importance ex- 
ceeds any enterprise of the kind in the province and in the northwest. The 
"B. &amp; K." manufactured by the house, is the leading brand of rolled oats in 
the northwest, and many other kinds of breakfast food are manufactured and 
find a ready sale on the market throughout the province and as far east as 
Winnipeg. The sales have increased until the annual business, once repre- 
sented by the sum of twenty-four thousand dollars, has reached over one 
million dollars each year. After the death of Mr. Brackman Mr. Ker became 
the principal owner of the business to which he is devoting his entire atten- 
tion and he has the reputation of being one of Victoria's most successful busi- 
ness men. 

On the 1 2th of June, 1894, Mr. Ker was united in marriage to Miss 
Laura Agnes Heisterman, a native of Victoria and a daughter of Henry T. 
Heisterman, now deceased, who was one of the distinguished pioneers of 
this city. Their union has been blessed with two sons and a daughter, all 
born in Victoria, the birthplace of their parents. In order of birth they are 
Rol^ert Henry Brackman, Bernard Russell and Laura Dabida. The Ker 
home is one of the delightful residences of Victoria. Mr. and Mrs. Ker are 
communicants of the Episcopal church and Mr. Ker is a Royal Arch Mason. 
In politics he is conservative. He belongs to the board of trade of Victoria 
and he takes a deep interest in and renders substantial aid to every enter- 
prise intended to promote the welfare or promote the permanent improve- 
ment of his native city. Honored and respected by all there is no man who 
occupies a more enviable position in business circles than Mr. Ker, not alone 
because of the large success he has achieved but also by reason of the straight- 
forward methods and commendable business policy he has ever followed. 

THORNTON FELL. 

Thornton Fell, a prominent representative of the British Columbia bar, 
and an alderman of his home city of Victoria and clerk of the Legislative 
Assernbly, has been a public-spirited man of affairs and a well known citizen 
of Victoria throughout his active career, and, because of his own success and 



590 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the conspicuous part taken by his father in the pubHc and business life of 
the province, the P&gt;11 family has for many years maintained a high position 
in social and business circles. 

Mr. Thornton Fell was born in Chester, England, in 1855. His father, 
the late James Fell, was born at Muncaster Head, Cumberland county, Eng- 
land, October 13, 1821, and was educated at his native place. Later he 
engaged in business in London and Liverpool in the wholesale tea trade. He 
was married in England to Miss Sarah Thornton. In 1862, accompanied 
by his eldest son, Fred Fell, he came out by way of the Panama route to 
British Columbia, and the two went to the gold fields of the Cariboo district, 
where they prospected and located a number of claims, but had only moderate 
success in this undertaking. They then went to Victoria and in partnership 
with Mr. John Finlayson opened a tea, spice and coffee business. This met 
with immediate and continued success, and in time a full stock of groceries 
was added, and the business thus established has ever since been conducted 
in the city, the firm name now being Fell and Company. 

Mr. James Fell died in 1890, being then in his sixty-ninth year. He 
was prominent in many other ways than by his connection with the city's 
commercial interests. He had fraternal relations with the Lidependent Order 
of Odd Fellows. His interest in public affairs and government policies made 
him an influential figure throughout his career. He took a firm stand for 
responsible government and confederation with the Dominion when that 
movement was uppermost in Canadian politics, and he was always a strong 
and uncompromising free trader. In 1882 he stood as a candidate for the 
house of commons, but was defeated. In 1886 he was elected mayor of 
Victoria, and re-elected in 1887, and gave the fullest satisfaction in the 
administration of the city's aft'airs and is remembered as one of the most 
capable executives the city has ever had. Educational affairs also found in 
him an able worker for advancement, and for fourteen years he served as a 
member of the school board. He helped organize the Mechanics' Institute, 
and was one of its trustees. He was a trustee of the Jubilee Hospital, was 
a member of the Pioneer Society and of St. George's Society, was president 
of the British Columbia Benevolent Society, of which he was one of the 
founders, and was in all matters of life a broad and generous character, 
benevolent in disposition and liberal with means and efforts toward the 
betterment of humanity and its institutions. He was a member of the Con- 
gregational church. His good wife died in England before she could join 
Her family in the new world. 

Mr. Thornton Fell continued to live in the English home until 1870, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 591 

when he came out to join his father, making- the long and rough passage 
around Cape Horn when he was but fifteen years old. He finished his edu- 
cation in Victoria, and then read law with the late Judge A. R. Robertson 
and with Edwin Johnson, K. C, and was admitted to the bar in 1881, since 
which year he has successfully carried on a large practice. He gives most 
of his attention to probate matters, real estate, company and commercial 
law. He has been clerk of the Legislative Assembly, also law clerk, for the 
past twenty-five years, and he has filled every position in life in an honorable 
and capable manner. 

In 1882 he was married to Miss Jessie Reid, who was born in Oldham. 
Lancashire. England, a daughter of Rev. John Reid. This union was blessed 
with two children, Edith and Ruby, who were bereaved of their beloved 
mother in 1895. In 1899 Mr. Fell was united in marriage with Miss Eliza- 
beth Forin, daughter of John Forin, Sr., of Belleville, Ontario. The fam- 
ily are Presbyterians, and Mr. Fell is an elder in the First Presbyterian church 
of the city. He is also a member of the Indepeiident Order of Odd Fellows. 

JOHN WILLIAM BLAND. 

John William Bland, a veterinary surgeon and quarantine inspector 
for New Zealand, Australia and the Dominion port of Vancouver', is a native 
of Toronto, Canada, his birth having occurred in the family home on the 
Gore road on the 4th of April, 1852. He is descended from the English no- 
bility, the ancestry of the family being traced back in the mother country to 
the fifteenth century. There have been many prominent representatives of 
the name in England, Canada and the United States, Senator Bland, of Mis- 
souri, being of this family. He is the author of the Bland silver bill and 
the champion of the cause of silver in the United States senate. In Eng- 
land the family won social prominence and representatives of the name 
were knighted and had a coat of arms. 

George Bland, father of John W. Bland, was born in England, as was 
also the grandfather, John Bland, who emigrated with his family to Toronto 
in 1830, settling in Peel, Canada. He obtained seven hundred acres of land, 
which he improved and which is still in possession of his descendants. George 
Bland was reared in Canada and after arriving at years of maturity wedded 
Miss Jane Elizabeth Dobson, a native of Toronto, and a daughter of Will- 
im Dobson, a pioneer settler of Toronto, who came to the new world from 
Yorkshire, England, and was a leading and influential citizen in the early 
days of Toronto's development, assisting in the promotion of movements 



692 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and measures that resulted in forming the early history of the city. The 
Church of England services were held in his log house in pioneer times and 
this structure is still preserved in the city as a historic landmark. The mem- 
bers of the family were all very prominent Church of England people. Mr. 
Bland's father died, in the sixtieth year of his age and his wife, still surviv- 
ing him, is now in her sixty-fifth year, residing upon the old homestead in 
Toronto. They were the parents of eight children, of whom six are now 
living; John William Bland being the only one who has left the home neigh- 
bbrhood. 

Educated in the public schools, John William Bland afterward attended 
the Toronto Veterinary College and later served in the northwest mounted 
police for four and a half years. He then engaged in the practice of his 
profession in Calgary in the Northwest Territory, where he remained for 
two years, after which he went to Berlin, Germany, and took a post-gradu- 
ate course. He then returne;jd to London, England, and pursued a course 
of lectures in that city prior to joining his wife's people in Dublin, Ireland. 
Later he was at Edinburg, Scotland, then returned to Dublin, and subse- 
quently again went to Toronto, Canada. Not long afterward he entered 
upon the practice of veterinary surgery at Millbrook and was appointed 
veterinary to the Prince of Wales Dragoons. He remained at that place for 
a year and in 1894 came to Vancouver, taking up his residence in this city. 
Here he began practice and was soon afterward appointed to his present office 
as veterinary surgeon and quarantine inspector for New Zealand, Australia 
and the Dominion port of Vancouver. He is recognized as the most highly 
educated and proficient veterinary surgeon in British Columbia or the north- 
west. It is his duty to inspect animals of all descriptions being shipped from 
Vancouver to foreign ports to see that they are free from disease, and for 
these services he receives fees that are regulated by law. 

In 1 89 1 Mr. Bland was married to Miss Annie Isabel Creagh, who 
was born in Listowel, county Kerry, Ireland, a daughter of John Creagh, 
who was descended from one of the prominent families of that country, trac- 
ing their ancestry back to one of the kings of Ireland. Sir George Owens, 
a granduncle of Mrs. Bland, was Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1876. She is 
also descended from Arch Deacon Palmer. Unto Mr. and Mrs. Bland has 
been born a son, Percival Newcombe. The parents hold membership in the 
Church of England, and Mr. Bland is a member of the Masonic fratern'ty. 
A gentleman of scholarly attainments and broad general culture, his knowl-. 
tdge being largely promoted through travel abroad, Mr. Bland is recognized 





^^(^^Pl.^^7^ 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 693 

as a cong-enial companion and one whose genuine personal worth has en- 
abled him to take a firm hold upon the affections and confidence of those 
with whom he has been associated. 

JAMES GOODFELLOW MANN. 

James Goodfellow Mann, a pioneer citizen and busines man of Victoria, 
made his arrival at E^quimault on May 7, 1862, and during the succeeding 
forty odd years has been capably and successfully connected with the best 
interests of this province. Mr. Mann has spent a varied career in this part 
of the Northwest, has known disappointment and hardship, but personal 
failure has never come near his life, for from every discouragement or set- 
back in the affairs of business he has recovered and continued to advance 
until his latter years show a substantial accumulation of world's goods as 
well as the high esteem that noble manhood and integrity of character always 
win. 

Mr. Mann is a native of the south of Scotland, where he was born July 
7, 1 841, and his Scotch parentage and ancestry were not the least of his excel- 
lent heritage from nature. His father, Andrew Mann, was born in Scot- 
land, where he married Miss Magdala Graham, a native of his own locality. 
They had eleven children, four of whom are living at this writing. The 
father's death was caused by an accident when he was in his fiftieth year, but 
his wife lived to be seventy-eight years old. He is buried in Scotland, and 
her resting place is at Victoria. The parents followed farming, and were 
consistent members of the Presbyterian church. 

Mr. Mann was educated at Selkirk. He remained in his native country 
until he was grown and at the age of twenty-one started out for the Pacific 
coast, where he hoped to find his fortune. Sailing from Liverpool to New 
York, thence by the Isthmus of Panama to San Francisco, shortly after his 
arrival at Victoria he went to the mines of the Cariboo region, and for the fol- 
lowing eight years did prospecting and gold mining. He also engaged in his 
trade of carpenter, in which he had become an accomplished workman while a 
resident of the old country, and this furnished him a reliable source of live- 
lihood during his mining career. He did considerable contracting and build- 
ing in the Cariboo region. On leaving there he went to Portland, Oregon, 
where he followed his trade for a time, and then returned to Victoria. Here 
he and Mr. James Muirhead formed a firm known for many years as Muir- 
head and Mann, which engaged in sawmilling and in the manufacture of all 
kinds of house material. They were extensive building contractors, and 
many of the fine houses of the city were erected by them. They placed the 



594 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

wood finishings in a number of the steamers built at Victoria, and also did 
all the carpentry work in the splendid capitol building of the province at 
Victoria, a structure which is not only a credit to the people of British Colum- 
bia but also to its builders. They also constructed the penitentiary at New 
Westminster, and all their undertakings were uniformly successful. Their 
one great business reverse was suffered on March ii, 1879, when their prop- 
erty was consumed by fire, and not a dollar's insurance covered the total loss. 
Three months later, however, they had rebuilt and resumed business at the 
full normal capacity. The firm's reputation for business integrity and relia- 
bility was so general that they experienced no difficulty in securing the needed 
backing for a renewal of their enterprises. 

Just five days before this destructive fire occurred an event which was 
compensatory for all the shocks and misfortunes that the future might bring. 
On the 6th of March, 1879, Mr. Mann was happily married to Miss Celina 
Brotherton, who was born in Manchester, England. They have since worked 
faithfully together in the affairs of life, and their co-operation and mutual 
assistance have gained them a liberal competence for the declining period of 
their lives. In 1884 they built their present commodious and attractive 
home at 33 Bridge street, and all the trees, flowers and shrubs which sur- 
round and adorn the residence were planted by themselves, and in this desir- 
able home they find their greatest joys and contentment. Mrs. Mann came 
out from England when a child, and spent her early years in Nashville, 
Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1865 moved to Portland, Ore- 
gon. Their marriage ocurred at Port Townsend, and during the twenty-five 
years of their united lives they have become the parents of four children, only 
one of whom, James Thomas, survives. 

Mr. Mann was one of the organizers of the first Presbyterian church 
in Victoria, and in the actual work of building constructed the pulpit and 
also raised and hung the bell. This structure was erected in the fall of 1862. 
He has since been one of the stanchest supporters of this denomination. Mrs. 
Mann was reared in the Episcopal church, but since her marriage has at- 
tended church with her husband and has come to love lx)th the church and 
its people, so that she has been able to say to her husband " Thy people shall 
be my people, and thy God my God," as did Ruth of old. Mr. and Mrs. 
Mann are held in high esteem in the social circles of the city, and have hosts 
of friends. Mr. Mann has sold out his business interests to his partner, and 
is now living a retired life with a freedom from cares such as a career of 
worthv and conscientious efforts deserves.

COLONEL GRIFFITHS WAINEWRIGHT. 

Lieutenant Colonel Griffiths Wainewright, who has spent a long and 
useful life in the service of his country, is now living retired, residing at 
No. iioo Seaton street, Vancouver. A native of London, England, he was 
born on the i6th of January, 1828, and is of English descent, the family 
having been represented in that country through many generations. His 
father, Thomas G. Wainewright, was born in England, became a cornet of 
the Seventh Dragoon Guards and later in life was engaged in literary work. 
He married Miss Cooper Ward, of a Sussex family on the paternal side. 
She was descended from the Griffiths. Colonel Wainewright's great-grand- 
father. Dr. Ralph Griffiths, LL. D., of Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, 
was of considerable literary note in his day. Thomas G. Wainewright was 
born in 1798 and died in 1832 at the age of thirty-four years, while his 
wife, who was born in 1800, died in 1863. They were members of the 
Church of England. 

Colonel Wainewright, their only child, was educated in Oxfordshire 
and at Egham, Surrey, and in 1842 entered the British navy, but left it in 
1848 in order to accept an appointment in the civil service in Melbourne, 
Australia, spending five years there as chief clerk in the chief secretary's 
office. He was afterward appointed lieutenant in the Victoria Artillery and 
in 1856 he returned to England. 

On the 1 6th of May, 1857, Colonel Wainewright was happily mar- 
ried to Mrs. Mary Maitland, a daughter of the Rev. W. W. Pym, rector of 
WlUian, Hertfordshire, and widow of Lieutenant John Maitland, R. N. 
Following his marriage he crossed the Atlantic with his bride to Canada and 
settled at Grafton, where he was engaged in business for a short time, but in 

1 861 they returned to England, visiting at the old home in that country. In 

1862 they returned to Canada and Colonel Wainewright became connected 
with the militia, acting as adjutant of a company in Brighton and afterward 
being appointed captain of a rifle company in that place. In 1864 he passed 
the examination of the then infantry military school and was the first cadet 
graduated therefrom. In 1866 he was appointed major of the Fortieth Bat- 
talion of Northumberland and w^as drill inspector of six companies in the 
county, being three times on the Finian raids. In 1870 he was appointed 
major of the Ontario Rifles and served in the Red river expedition of that 
year. In 1874 he was adjutant of the N. W. mounted police, and in 1878 
was commandant of Dufferin College, London, Ontario, which position he 
filled for two and a half years, and was at the same time adjutant of the 



596 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Seventh Regiment, being then a retired Heiitenant colonel. Removing to 
Halifax he spent seven years there and in 1890 he went to Calgary, where 
he remained until 1899. 

In that year Colonel Wainewright came to Vancouver, seeking a better 
climate because of his wife's impaired health, but after residing here for 
about three years her death occurred on the 2d of December, 1902. Her 
loss was deeply felt by Colonel Wainewright and her surviving family. 
They had four children : Claude, a resident of Vancouver ; Beatrice, now 
the wife of Mr. C. D. Rickards, of Calgary; Mrs. Constance Stone, a widow, 
who is supervising her father's household ; and Edward, who was drowned 
in Shoal lake in 1882. He had attained his nineteenth year and was a very 
promising young man. Colonel Wainewright and his family are members 
of the Church of England. He has a very pleasant home at No. iioo Seaton 
street, Vancouver, and has been more or less engaged in literary work. 

J. G. SCOTT. 

To know J. G. Scott in the business world is to recognize in him a man 
of intense activity, who, watchful of opportunities, has developed along mod- 
ern lines business enterprises of magnitude and importance, for he is now 
the manager and the vice president of the Pacific Coast Lumber Company; 
to know him in his private life is to recognize in him the qualities of man- 
hood which induce congeniality, companionships and strong friendships. 
Moreover, he has endeavored to ameliorate for others the hard conditions 
of life and although unostentatious in his work of this character his efiforts 
in behalf of his fellow men have been far-reaching and beneficial. 

Mr. Scott, who has resided on the Pacific coast since 189 1, was born 
in Stratford, Ontario, in 1859, and is of Scotch descent. His connection 
with the lumber industry began as an employe of the Medonte Lumber Com- 
pany, of Simcoe county, Ontario, which operated large tracts of lumber land 
in that part of the province. When the lumber industry became exhausted 
there Mr. Scott made his way to the Pacific coast in 1891I and with several 
other prominent lumbermen of Ontario organized the Pacific Coast Lumber 
Company in New Westminster on the banks of the Eraser river. The opera- 
tions of the company were confined entirely to the manufacture of cedar lum- 
ber and cedar shingles, the object being to ultimately build up an industry 
of large proportions. The outcome of their efforts is to be seen in the pres- 
ent plant situated in Coal Harbor, Vancouver, having a capacity of thirty- 
five million feet of lumber of all dimensions per annum, together with eighty- 
five million shingles. The office of the company is at the corner oi Cardero

and Georgia streets, in front of which runs the Hne of the Park street car. 
The sawmill occupies the east side of the company's property and is sixty 
by three hundred feet and two stories in height. The big log Haulup is 
capable of handling the largest logs and the mill is equipped with ten feet 
band saws, one on either side of the log deck, from which both of the car- 
riages can take logs, although one side of the mJU was intended to be used 
as the resawing side. The heavy side is equipped with a log turner, by means 
of which the heaviest as well as the smallest logs are loaded on the carriage 
and turned as easily as if they were hop poles. Every part of the machinery 
of the mill is of the most improved kind and manufacture. The planing 
mill is one hundred feet from the sawmill and is seventy-two by one hundred 
and twenty feet in dimensions and two stories in height, while the tools and 
equipments are models in every respect. The main floor is given to the 
flooring machines, molds, lumber trimming devices and six inch resaw and 
a sixty inch double drum snader. The last mentioned machine is the first 
of its kind in the province and with it the company will sand finish the floor- 
ing, ceiling and such inside lumber as can be sanded. This does away with 
the necessity for the expense and laborious work of hand dressing and sand 
papering the interior finish lumber and will be a large saving of expense. 
The shingle mill is an entirely separate plant and occupies a building about 
two hundred feet west of the sawmill. This is a large industr}^ in itself and 
is equipped w^ith the latest improved and best labor saving machinery. The 
boiler house is situated half way between the saw and shingle mills and is 
fifty-two by eighty feet. It is constructed as nearly fire proof as is possible. 
The sawmill is driven by a pair of twenty-four by thirty vertical engines, 
the planing mill by a pair of fourteen by twenty horizontal engines and the 
shingle mill by a fourteen by twenty-four vertical engine, all set on concrete 
foundations. For the purpose of lighting the entire plant a seven hundred 
and fifty light direct current dynamo has been installed, this -machine being 
driven by a twelve by twelve Rob engine and both arc and incandescent 
lights are used. Tliere are six rooms in the dry kiln, with space provided 
for more should they be demanded, and these are also as nearly noncom- 
bustible as it is possible to make them, while the system of hose extends all 
over the buildings to be used in case of fire. The company owns large 
tracts of timber both on the mainland and on the islands and has suffered nq 
loss through forest fires. There are two sets of logging camps, giving em- 
ployment to about five hundred men. It will thus be seen that the enterprise 
is one of great importance, contributing in large measure to the industrial 
and commercial activity of the province as well as to the success of the

individual stockholders. W. J. Shepherd of Ontario is president of the 
company, while Mr. Scott is manager and vice president, and G. F. Gibson, 
secretary and treasurer. 

Notwithstanding that Mr. Scott is a man who gives close and unre- 
mitting attention to business he has also found time to take an active interest 
in municipal affairs and for three years during his residence in New West- 
minster was a meml^er of the city council of that place, while in 1900 and 
1 901 he was its mayor, but during the latter year the removal of the business 
to Vancouver necessitated his taking up his residence in this city. 

THOMAS FRANCIS McGUIGAN. 

Thomas Francis McGuigan, who has been an officer in Vancouver since 
the inception of the city, continuously filling the position of city clerk, was 
born in Stratford, Ontario, on the 27th of June, i860. He is descended 
from Irish ancestry, his father, Michael McGuigan, having been born in 
Ireland, whence he emigrated to Canada in early manhood. He settled in 
the county of Perth and was there married to Miss Mary Quinlivan. His 
birth occurred in county Derry, while his wife was a native of county Clare, 
Ireland. They were married in Canada and there reared their family of 
ten children, all of whom are still living. The father reached the age of eighty 
years, while the mother lived to be seventy-five years of age. They were 
faithful members of the Roman Catholic church and enjoyed the good will 
and respect of all with whom they were associated. Four of their family 
now reside in British Columbia: Dr. W. J. McGuigan, now mayor of Van- 
couver; James, an electrician; Agnes, who is living with her brother in Van- 
couver; and Thomas F. 

In the grammar schools of his native town, Thomas Francis McGuigan 
acquired his early education, which was supplemented by study in McGill 
University and following the completion of his collegiate course he came 
to the province of British Columbia in 1882. After acquiring his education 
he engaged in teaching school for some time and then entered the employ 
of the Canadian Pacific Railroad Company, being in the stores department 
during the construction of the road. He came to Vancouver on the first 
through train in November. 1885, finding here an almost unbroken forest 
where now stands the beautiful city with its metropolitan advantages and im- 
provements. At that time there was a mill and a few cheap houses together 
with several Indian shacks, but Mr. McGuigan noted its advantageous loca- 
tion, also recognized trade possibilities and feeling certain that this was to be 
the leading town of the province he resolved to ally his interests with the 



m. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 599 

embyro city. There were many candidates for the office of clerk, but his 
quahfications were well known and he was elected to that office as its first 
incumbent. Such has been his ability and efficiency in the discharge of duties 
that he has been re-elected from time to time, his service being continuous. 
His fellow townsmen have the utmost confidence in him as an official and 
the affairs of the office are capably demonstrated under his direction. 

It would be difficult to find one who has more intimate knowledge or 
broader information concerning the affairs of Vancouver than has Mr. Mc- 
Guigan. He was active in all the preliminary work of establishing the city 
government and because of the marvelous growth of the city his task has 
been an arduous and important one. He has been connected with the estab- 
lishment of all the municipal positions and has succeeded in so thoroughly 
organizing the city government that its interests have been managed with 
little friction. The work in his own office has increased more than one hun- 
dred fold, but he has capably met every duty as it has come, has secured able 
assistants and in the administration of the duties of city clerk has won high 
encomiums. 

In 1890 occurred the marriage of Mr. McGuigan and Miss Minnie 
Stewart, a native of Prince Edward Island and of Scotch ancestry. They 
have two children : Stewart Parnell and Mary Campbell Frances, both bom 
in Vancouver. Mr. McGuigan is of social nature and cordial disposition 
and he and his family enjoy the high esteem of a host of warm friends in 
the city of his choice. 

ALEXANDER McRAE. 

Alexander McRae, postmaster at Revelstoke, is an old-time citizen of this 
town, having resided here almost from its beginning, has taken prominent 
part in business and public affairs, and is a representative of the highest type 
of public-spirited citizenship such as is the best adornment and greatest factor 
of progress in interior British Columbia. Of recognized honesty and integrity, 
energetic and persistent, from the outset of his career he has easily made his 
own way and w'hile gaining his own livelihood and a secure place in material 
affairs he has also won the esteem and respect of his fellow citizens. 

A native of Glengary, Ontario, born February 7, 1863, his father, 
Alexander McRae, being now deceased, but his mother, Jane (Dey) Mc- 
Rae, still living in Glengary, Mr. McRae grew up in his native province, 
acquired a public . school education, interspersed with wholesome training in 
industrious and honest habits, and after leaving the parental roof he fol- 
lowed the arduous pursuit of lumbering in the woods of Michigan, Wis- 



600 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

consin and Minnestoa. Mr. McRae has lived in Revelstoke since the spring 
of 1886, at which time he came out to this province to continue the kimber 
business. He did lumber contracting for the Canadian Pacific Railroad, and 
for about six years prospected in the mines of this vicinity. 

Mr. McRae's public service career has displayed his eminent usefulness 
to his fellow citizens outside the sphere of his own private duties and re- 
sponsibilities. He entered the public service as mining recorder and con- 
stable. He was chief license inspector for the district and was also mining 
recorder at Trout Lake. He resigned from' the provincial offices in order 
to contest the Revelstoke Riding, but was defeated. In 1902 he was ap- 
pointed postmaster, and has since filled this office to the eminent satisfaction 
of all concerned, his zeal and conscientious devotion to all affairs of the city 
and district making him an ideal public official. 

Mr. McRae was married in 1890 to Miss Annie Richardson, a daughter 
of Thomas Richardson, of Dorchester, Ontario. Mr. and Mrs. McRae have 
six sons, Alexander, Charles, Walter, Thomas, William John and James. 
Mr. McRae affiliates with Kootenay Lodge No. 15, A. F. &amp; A. M., and he 
and his wife adhere to the Presbyterian church. 

ALEXANDER JACK. 

Alexander Jack, whose labors have been a factor in the development 
of the rich mineral resources of British Columbia and who in his business 
career has advanced from a humble financial position to one of affluence, 
is numbered among the early settlers of Victoria of 1862. He was born in 
New Mecklin, parish of Intherickshire, Scotland, about ten miles east of the 
city of Glasgow, on the 9th of November, 1827. His father, John Jack, 
descended from the lowland Scotch ancestry, was a farmer and was one of 
the steadfast members of the " Ould Kirk " of Scotland. He lived to the 
age of seventy-five years, but his wife died of cholera in 1853. They were 
the parents of seven sons and five daughters, but only two are now living. 

Alexander Jack acquired his early education in his native country and 
spent the days of his youth upon his father's farm, no event of special im- 
portance occurring to vary the routine of farm life for him while he was 
mastering the labors of the fields and the lessons taught in the schoolroom. 
Attracted, however, by favorable reports concerning the business opportuni- 
ties of the Pacific coast country, he made the voyage around Cape Horn in 
the old ship Celesta in 1862, arriving in Victoria in the fall of that year. 
One hundred and twenty-eight days passed ere. the voyage was completed 
and there were three hundred passengers on board. The vessel was com- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 601 

mandecl by Captain Joslyn and of all these who came to British Columbia 
on that occasion Mr. Jack knows of but thirty who are now living. He was 
first engaged in British Columbia in clearing land for Sir James Douglas, 
also in making rails and building fences. In this he was associated with 
John Waddle as a partner. They also were given a contract for digging a 
cell'ir for Sir James Douglas. In the spring of 1863, however, they went to 
the Cariboo mining district, prospecting in that locality, but the gold was so 
deep that the water prevented successful work in the mines. In 1865 Mr. 
Jack was associated with others in the ownership of a claim, of which he 
was made foreman. At first it did not yield profitably and the company be- 
came involved in debt to the amount of sixteen thousand dollars. However, 
owing to the unfaltering perseverance and determination combined with the 
practical business methods of Mr. Jack the work of developing the mine was 
placed upon a paying basis and in seven weeks the indebtedness was not only 
cleared off but there was also a profit of three thousand dollars accruing to 
each of its partners. The other partners also gave to Mr. Jack a gold watch 
valued at two hundred and fifty dollars, which was properly inscribed and 
Vshich he still carries. It is an excellent time piece, being yet in good condi- 
tion. Mr. Jack also had another claim that paid him nine thousand dollars 
and is still bearing. Later he went to Mosquito creek, where with others he 
owned the Minnehaha, named by Dr. Corral, who was one of the promoters. 
Mr. Jack spent two years at Peace creek, where he has mining interests yield- 
ing him about seven hundred dollars a year, and later he went to Cassiar, 
where he took out one thousand dollars in a year. He also worked for 
wages at mining and he spent four and a half years in mining operations at 
Ashel. realizing two thousand dollars from his labor, being paid two pounds 
a day. In 1852 he went to Australia and was there engaged in mining, 
securing a claim for which he paid twenty sovereigns. This proved a very 
fortunate investment, for he took out one hundred pounds in one week and 
twenty pounds in a single day. He sold his mining property and returned 
to Scotland, taking contracts there on the Clyde, in which venture he both 
made and lost money. 

Mr. Jack was united in marriage to Miss Agnes Main, a daughter of 
Robert Main and they came together to British Columbia in 1862. At the 
time of his second visit to Scotland his wife had been at home for three 
years and he returned for her and again brought her with him to British 
Columbia. They were also accompanied by two nieces, whom they reared, 
one being Jane Jackson, who married William Dixon and has since passed 
away, while the other, Christina Forest, is now the wife of Donald Kear. 



602 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. and Mrs. Jack had no children of their own, but their union was a very 
happy one until 1889, when she was taken from him by death. She was a 
lady of very benevolent, kindly and charitable spirit, was one of the organ- 
izers of the orphanage and was a woman much beloved not only by her 
immediate family, but also by many friends. Mr. Jack is a member of St. 
Andrews Presbyterian church, assisted liberally in the building of the church 
edifice and has been generous in his contributions toward the erection of other 
churches in Victoria. He occupies a pleasant home on Michigan avenue, 
which he built many years ago and he also had a ranch of one hundred 
acres, which he has recently sold. He is a member of the Independent Order 
of Odd Fellows and has a wide and favorable acquaintance in Victoria and 
British Columbia. His knowledge of the growth and development of the 
province comes not from reading or hearsay, but from actual experience as 
an eye witness of what has been accomplished. 

WILLIAM SKENE. 

William Skene, secretary of the Vancouver board of trade, is probably 
one of the best informed men concerning the history of Vancouver in all its 
departments of activity and growth from its founding to the present. Be- 
sides knowing so thoroughly all the events that have transpired in the devel- 
opment of this phenomenal city, he has likewise been a conspicuous factor in 
promoting that development, and in private business affairs and by work 
of semi-public nature he has helped advance Vancouver to a front rank among 
the commercial and industrial centers of the great northwest. 

Mr. Skene was born in Glasgow, Scotland, June 8, 1842, of highland 
Scotch ancestry, his father, Alexander Skene, being a native of West Fife, 
Scotland, and a resident of the city of Glasgow, while his mother, Isabella 
(Sutherland) Skene, was born in Sutherlandshire, Scotland, and died many 
years before her husband, both parents being Presbyterians in ■ religious 
f-aith. 

Mr. Skene, after receiving his education in the Glasgow Academy and 
obtaining a practical training in the dry goods business, subsequently spent 
twenty-five years in connection with practical woolen manufacturing in York- 
shire and the West of England. His attention was directed to the excep- 
tional business opportunities and the fine climate of British Columbia, and, 
being so favorably and convincingly influenced, he made his arrival in Van- 
couver in 1887. The town was then only a year old, and only two brick 
buildings marked the site of the city of granite and brick which is now the 
pride of the citizens and an object lesson of the prosperity and resources of 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 603 

British Columbia, There was then no clearing west of Granville street. 
One of the buildings mentioned was on the corner of Homer and Cor- 
dova streets, having been built by Mr. Jam.es Angus, of Victoria, and the 
other had been built by A. G. Ferguson at the foot of Carroll and Alex- 
ander streets. In this embryo city Mr. Skene opened a wholesale dry goods 
house for Samuel Greenshield's Son and Company, and he conducted this 
business for ten years, after which he took up assignee work and general 
agency business. Mr. Skene has travelled extensively on the continent of 
Europe, and is conversant with the French and German languages. From 
the first he has been interested in all undertakings for the advancement of 
Vancouver's material prosperity. He was one of the organizers and a char- 
ter member of the board of trade, and has served as its secretary since 1901. 
He is also secretary of the Vancouver General Hospital. 

HON. NOAH SHAKESPEARE. 

The name of Noah Shakespeare is deeply engraved on the pages of Vic- 
toria's history, for through many years he has been a most important factor 
in its interests. • His life has been filled with good deeds and labors of love 
toward his fellows, and his career has ever been that of an honorable, enter- 
prising and progressive man, whose well rounded character also enabled him 
to take an active interest in educational, social and moral affairs, and to keep 
well informed concerning the momentous questions affecting the welfare of 
the nation. In all life's relations he commands the respect and confidence 
of those with whom he has come in contact, and his upright life should serve 
as an inspiration to the many friends who are familiar with his virtues. 

A native son of England, Mr. Shakespeare was born at Brierly Hill, 
Staffordshire, January 26, 1839, and is a representative of stanch old Eng- 
lish ancestry. His parents were Noah and Hannah (Mathews) Shakespeare, 
both natives of the fatherland, and descendants of the Shakespeare family 
of which the poet was also a member. In the town of his birth the son Noah 
spent the period of his boyhood and youth, and becoming imbued with the 
idea that across the water in the new world brighter prospects awaited him, 
he in 1862 made the voyage around Cape Horn on the steamship Robert Low, 
arriving in Victoria, British Columbia, on Saturday evening of January 11, 
1863. He was the only member of his family to undertake the journey to 
this then almost unknown province. At that time the city of Victoria was 
almost in its infancy, and Mr. Shakespeare landed without capital, a stranger 
in a strange land. He accomplished the first task that was offered him, 
which was in the Vancouver Collieries. His work thereafter was in Nan- 



604 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

aimo District, at the Pit Head, for the Hon. Robert Dunsmuir, continuing 
there and at the mines until 1864, in which year he returned to Victoria and 
engaged in the photographic business. Later he became a dealer in real 
estate, buying and selling property in his own name. 

From the first Mr. Shakespeare became deeply interested in the wel- 
fare of the city which he chose as his home, and finding that British Colum- 
bia was fast becoming the "dumping ground" for the lowest Asiatic ele- 
ment, he espoused the cause of the working man and became a leader among 
them. An Anti-Chinese Society was formed, of which Mr. Shakespeare 
was made the president, and in 1876 his name headed a petition, signed by 
fifteen hundred workingmen, asking the Dominion parliament for an act 
restricting the emigration of Chinese to this country. He was soon after- 
ward elected an alderman of the city, in which position he served four years, 
and in 1882 was elected its mayor by a large majority of the votes. So sat- 
isfactorily did he discharge the duties of that important office that at the 
termination of his term his fellow citizens, in token of their appreciation of 
his eminent services, presented him with an illuminated address. And it 
was during his mayorality that Governor General Lx&gt;rd Lorfte and Princess 
Lx)uise visited the Pacific coast, and upon Mayor Shakespeare devolved the 
duty of entertaining the city's distinguished guests, which position of honor 
he filled in a manner highly satisfactory. In 1882 he was also elected a 
member of parliament for the house of commons at Ottawa, to \yhich he was 
re-elected in 1885, and during his service was active in securing the present 
emigration restriction law passed in 1886. He resigned his seat in parlia- 
ment to accept the office of postmaster of Victoria, a position he has con- 
tinued to fill to the present time, covering a period of seventeen years, and 
which he filled to the satisfaction of the government and to the patrons of 
the office. He now has under his immediate supervision tw^enty clerks and 
twelve carriers, and the receipts of the office in 1903 were fifty-two thou- 
sand, three hundred and forty-three dollars. 

In many other ways Mr. Shakespeare has shown his interest and activ- 
ity in the affairs of the province. In 1882 he was elected president of the 
Mechanics' Institute, was active in the organization of the British Colum- 
bia Agricultural Association, and in 1885 was elected its president. Desir- 
ing to again visit the scenes of his childhood and youth and to renew the 
acquaintances of earlier years, he returned to England, and while there gave 
several lectures on the resources and advantages of British Columbia, which 
influenced many of the leading citizens to come to the northwest. Mr. 
Shakespeare was also one of the organizers of the British Columbia Fire 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 605 

Insurance Company, of which he was elected president in 1886. Ever an 
active worker in the cause of temperance, in 1877 he was elected grand 
worthy chief templar of the grand lodge of Washington Territory and Brit- 
ish Columbia, filling the same position in the following year, and in 1886 
was elected president of the Young Men's Christian Association of Victoria. 
He is president of the Provincial Branch of the International Sunday-school 
Association, has been superintendent of the Methodist Sunday-school for 
the past fifteen years, and has long been an active and helpful member of 
the Methodist church. 

In 1859 Mr. Shakespeare was united in marriage tO' Miss Elizabeth 
Pearson, a native of the state of New York and a daughter of Thomas 
Pearson. Mrs. Shakespeare, with her eldest child, came from England and 
joined her husband in this country one year after his arrival, making the 
long passage around Cape Horn. Eight children were born to them, four 
of whom are now living, namely: Frederick N. E., William B., Hannah 
M., the wife of Fred Berryman, and Percy S. All are adherents of the 
Methodist church. The family reside in a beautiful cottage, the "Stratford," 
which he has surrounded with beautiful trees, shrubs and flowers, and is a 
fitting abode in which to spend the evening of a long and well spent life. 

GEORGE RANDALL ASHWELL. 

George Randall Ashwell, one of the oldest and best known citizens of 
the Chilliwack valley, is also an old-timer of British Columbia, and he has 
spent the greater part of his active career in the province. Having come 
here during pioneer days, he is familiar with all the course of development 
by which British Columbia emerged from a wilderness into one of the richest 
and most productive parts of the Dominion, and the broad lines which his 
own activity has followed make him also a prominent factor in the history 
and welfare of the province. 

Born in Bedfordshire, England, December 17, 183 1, a son of Henry 
and Mary (Randall) Ashwell, Mr. Ashwell, following the period of his 
years devoted to attendance at the public schools of his native shire, took up 
landscape gardening as a profession, and followed that in England until 
he was twenty-five years old. On his emigration to Canada in 1856 he 
spent the first six months at Toronto, and he then did carpenter work in 
various places in Ontario for five years. He came out to New Westmin- 
ster in 1861. and during the first year engaged in carpentering. He then 
went into the hardware and furniture business with Thomas Cunningham, 
and two years later the two departments of the business were divided, Mr. 



606 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Ashwell retaining the furniture department and conducting it for eight 
years. In 1871 he moved into the ChilHvvack valley and bought out several 
settlers' rights in land. He is now the owner of seven hundred acres in 
this fertile region, and has been a prominent and progressive factor in the 
agricultural affairs of the locality. He also started a general merchandise 
store at the landing on the river in 1873, and conducted that for twelve 
years, until his removal into Chilliwack, where he is now the proprietor of 
an extensive general merchandise store, a two-story metal covered' and one 
of the most complete and reliable establishments in the province. 

Mr. Ashwell is the owner of a large amount of town property, and he 
is interested in every line of development which will promote the progress 
and welfare of his district. He is one of the prime movers in the proposed 
electric road to connect the valley with New Westminster. He has been 
reeve of the municipality for several terms, and for years was a member of the 
council. He is at present justice of the peace. As a staunch Conservative 
in politics, he was, in 1902. the candidate of that party for parliament, and he 
made the best run for a Conservative ever made in the district, missing the 
election by only the narrow margin of seventeen votes. He and his family 
are Methodists. 

Mr. Ashwell was married in 1867 to Miss Sarah Ann Webb, a daughter 
of John Webb, of England. Their three children are John Henry, George 
Horatio Webb and Ethel May, who is the wife of Dr. Allen, of Vancouver. 

JOHN L. BECKWITH. 

John L. Beckwith, prominent in the political circles of Victoria and 
now serving as one of its aldermen, is also one of the most active business 
men of the city, at present a member of the board of trade of the province 
and a representative of an extensive commission business and also of the 
salmon industry of the northwest. He was born in Kentville, Nova Scotia, 
on the 5th of March, 1856, and traced his ancestry back for many genera- 
tions. The Beckwiths went from Normandy to England at the time when 
William the Conqueror left that country, Sir Hugh de Malebisse being a sir 
knight of Normandy. His grandson, Sir Hercules de Malebisse, in the year 
1226 married Lady Beckwith Bruce, a daughter of Sir William Bruce, lord 
of Ugelborby, who inherited his rank and lands from Sir Robert Bruce, of 
Shelton castle, the progenitor of the royal family of Bruce in Scotland. It 
was from this marriage that the name of Beckwith was derived. Lady 
Beckwith Bruce inherited an estate or manor called Beckwith in the old 
Anglo-Saxon, and with a view to perpetuating the name she required her 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 607 

husband by the marriage contract to assume the name of Beckwith. From 
this ancestry the Beckwith family, of which John L. Beckwith is a member, 
is descended. For generations they were lords of many of the old castles 
in England. 

Mathew Beckwith emigrated from England to New England in the 
year 1645. Two of his sons, Samuel and Renald, emigrated to Nova Scotia 
in 1760, and were the founders of the family there. They resided near the 
site of the present township of Cornwallis and Samuel Beckwith received a 
large grant of land from the English government. His son, Samuel, became 
a merchant and extensive farmer and married Miss Rebecca Chipman. The 
Chipmans traced their ancestry back to John Chipman, who was one of the 
earliest settlers of New England, coming to America from Dorsetshire. He 
married a daughter of a Mr. Howland, who was the pilgrim that landed 
first on Plymouth Rock in 1620, and thus the subject of this review is also 
descended from one of the distinguished bands of Puritans that made the 
first settlement on the coast of New England, having crossed the Atlantic 
in order to secure religious liberty. William Beckwith, a son of Samuel 
Beckwith, became a Baptist clergyman and settled at Halifax. John Beck- 
with, who with his brother located near Cornwallis in 1760, became a wealthy 
land owner. The members of the Beckwith family w'ere loyal to the crown 
and when the spirit of discontent arose in the colonies along the Atlantic 
coast the Beckwiths left that part of the country and settled in Nova Scotia. 
John Beckwith married a Miss Catherine Chipman, a sister of his brother's 
wife. His son, Handley Beckwith, was born in Cornwallis, March 6, 1779, 
and their son, Mayhew, was born in Cornwallis, April 7, 1801. He was the 
grandfather of John L. Beckwith of this review and he became a prominent 
merchant. He was also one of the leading members of the Baptist church' in 
his locality and took a very active and helpful part in the organization of 
the Acadia University. He also represented Kings county in the Nova Scotia 
legislature and was a leading factor in the intellectual, political, material 
and moral development of his native province. He married Eunice Rand. 

John Albert Beckwith, son of Mayhew and Eunice (Rand) Beckwith, 
was born in Cornwallis and early in life became a merchant there. Subse- 
quently, however, he gave his attention to agricultural and horticultural pur- 
suits and became a celebrated fruit-raiser and packer of Nova Scotia. He 
married Miss Rebecca Barnaby, a native of Cornwallis. She was descended 
from the Chipman family, being a niece of the late Hon. Samuel Chipman, 
who was a man of note and attained to the very advanced age of one hundred 
and five years. Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith became the parents of seven sons, 



608 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

all of whom following the advice of Horace Greeley went to the west. All 
are now living with the exception of Alfred, who died in Portland, Oregon, 
in 1893. William S. resides in Victoria. H. R. located in Portland, Ore- 
gon, and is engaged in the commission business there. Harry M. also resides 
in Portland, Oregon, where he is a member of a retail grocery firm. Arthur 
W. is a stock rancher of Montana and is the assessor of the town of Hamil- 
ton. Norman still resides on the old homestead farm, where he is engaged 
in fruit-raising. The father died in 1891 at the age of seventy-two, while 
his wife lived to the age of seventy-five. They were Baptists in religious 
faith and were people of the highest respectability, enjoying the fullest con- 
fidence and esteem of all who knew them. The family is now a numerous 
one in both Canada and the United States and many representatives of the 
name have filled high positions of honor and trust and have also been noted 
for their devotion to moral influences and their activity in church work. 

John L. Beckwith pursued his education in his native town and in early 
life became familiar with the methods of merchandising, becoming an em- 
ploye in a retail dry goods establishment. He has made merchandising his 
life work and was one of the pioneer commercial travelers of British Colum- 
bia, traveling over this country ere the construction of the railroad. For 
five years he was a representative of Messrs. H. Shorey &amp; Company, whole- 
sale clothing manufacturers of Montreal, and for fifteen years has repre- 
sented the firm of Mann, Byars &amp; Company, of Glasgow, Scotland. He 
has carried their goods as far east as Winnipeg. He has otherwise repre- 
sented large wholesale dry goods firms and he is now in the general com- 
mission business and has the agency of the Canada Rubber Company of 
Montreal. He is also connected with the salmon canning industry and is a 
member of the Clayoquot Sound Canning Company, Limited. He likewise 
has invested interests in several mining enterprises and owns extensive 
realty interests in the province. Mr. Beckwith is a man of excellent 
business ability and executive force, resourceful and enterprising and his 
ready recognition of opportunity has been one of the salient features in his 
success. He has steadily advanced, finding in each onward step opportunity 
for further progress and he stands today as one of the most prominent and 
prosperous business men of Victoria. 

In 1899 Mr. Beckwith was elected alderman of Victoria and filled the 
ofiice so capably that he was re-elected for three years. After an interval of 
two years he was once more chosen for the office and is now serving his 
fourth term. He has been active in promoting every enterprise destined to 
improve and upbuild the city and he is a member of its board of trade.

Mr. Beckwith was married in 1888 to Miss Agnes McLeod, a daugh- 
ter of A. J. McLeod, of Boston, Massachusetts. Their marriage has been 
blessed with three children, namely : Harold Arthur, Alfred Edward and 
Grace Dean McLeod. Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith have a nice home in which 
the spirit of hospitality reigns supreme. They are members of the Baptist 
church and he belongs to the Order of Foresters and to the Royal Arcanum. 
His life has been one of continuous activity, in which has been accorded due 
recognition, of labor; and today he is numbered among the substantial citi- 
zens of his county. His interests are thoroughly identified with those of 
the northwest, and at all times he is ready to lend his aid and co-operation 
to any movement calculated to benefit this section of the country or advance 
its wonderful development. 

E. B. MARVIN. 

The pioneer history of Victoria has upon its rolls the name of E. B. 
Marvin, who for the long period of forty-four years has resided within its 
borders and is therefore one of its oldest residents. Of the work of prog- 
ress and advancement he has ever been an advocate, and by his active partici- 
pation as well as friendly encouragement has assisted in the development 
and substantial promotion of the city, while in all the relations of life he has 
ever commanded the respect and confidence of those with whom he has been 
brought in contact. 

E. B. Marvin was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the i6th of De- 
cember, 1830, and is a representative of an old English family who emigrated 
to Connecticut during the Colonial days. During the Revolutionary war 
they were Loyalists, and, removing to Halifax, Grandfather Marvin was 
there given land by his government for loyalty and for the losses he had 
sustained thereby. William H. and Jane Marvin, the parents of him whose 
name introduces this review, were natives of Halifax, and were members 
of the Church of England. On June 20, 1852, he took passage on the ship 
William H. Harbeck bound for San Francisco, sailing via Cape Horn and 
landing at his destination on the 30th of November following. He remained 
in San Francisco until January, 1857, and was there during all the exciting 
times attending the reign of the vigilantes and was an active participant in 
upholding law and order. In that year, however, Mr. Marvin took passage 
on the bark Live Yankee, with Captain Gove, for Sidney, Australia, reach- 
ing that city on the 25th of March, 1857. After a three weeks' stay in Sid- 
ney he went to Melbourne and thence to the mines, but did not meet with 
the expected success at those places. In 1858, hearing of the gold excite- 



610 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ment on Fraser river, he returned to Melbourne, and thence took passage to 
Victoria, British Cohimbia, arriving January 13, 1859, and upon his arrival 
here he started his ship chandlery business, this being in January, 1859, and 
on the ground on which his present store is now located. Here for the past 
lorty-five years he has conducted an eminently successful business, and has 
the honor of being the pioneer ship chandler in Victoria. In addition he is 
also a pioneer in the sealing business at Victoria, and with his partners is 
doing a large and successful business in that line. 

Mr. Marvin has always been a Conservative in politics. He has served 
his city as justice of the peace since 1874, also as alderman in 1876-7-8, 
is an active member of the board of trade and is one of its counselors. Both 
he and his wife are valued members of the Church of England. They have 
erected one of the fine residences for which Victoria is justly celebrated, 
located at No. 34 Cadboro Bay Road, and there they dispense a gracious 
hospitality to their many friends. 

HERBERT STANTON. 

Herbert Stanton, registrar at Nanaimo, followed the Canadian Pacific 
Railway out to British Columbia, having assisted in the construction of 
that great trunk line, and in the twenty years subsequent to that time he has 
been one of British Columbia's most public-spirited and energetic citizens. 
He has worked out his successful career by his own earnest efforts and per- 
sistent application to the work in hand, and he is deserving of all the pros- 
perity that time and endeavor can bring to him. 

A native of Toronto, Ontario, where he was born August 6, 1857, he 
was a son of Isaac Brock and Maria (Wilson) Stanton. His father, who 
was a native of Amherstburg, Ontario, died in 1881, and he lost his mother 
in i8go. Mr. Stanton received a public school education at Ottawa, and 
learned the machinist's trade at Oshawa. For five years he was in the hotel 
business at Cobourg, Ontario, and following that he began doing construc- 
tion work on the line of the Canadian Pacific between Winnipeg and Lake 
Superior, and continued at that until that portion of the road was completed. 
In 1884 he came out to British Columbia, and did construction work for 
the Canadian Pacific for three years. In 1887 he began his official career 
as private secretary to Lieutenant Governor Nelson. In 1893, having been 
appointed to the office of assistant government agent and deputy registrar, 
he moved to Nanaimo, which has since been his home, and in 1894 he was 
advanced to his present position of registrar.

In 1893 Mr. Stanton was married to Miss Agnes Jamieson, a daughter 
of Michael Jamieson, of Victoria. His rehgious adherence is with the 
Church of England. 

WILLIAM J. McGUIGAN, M. D. 

Dr. Wilham J. McGuigan, mayor of Vancouver, and coroner and one 
of the leading men of British Columbia, was born at Stratford, Ontario, in 
1853, and he is a son of Michael and Bridget (Quinlivan) McGuigan. Michael 
was born in Castle Dawson, in the north of Ireland, and came to Canada in 
the early forties, locating on a farm at Stratford, where he died in 1888. The 
mother of our subject was born in county Clare, south of Ireland, and came 
to Canada when a young girl. She was married at Stratford, where she is 
still living. 

Dr. McGuigan was educated in the grammar school at Stratford, and at 
Gait Collegiate Institute, Gait, Ontario, which in those days was under Dr. 
William Tassie, a noted and greatly beloved educator. From Gait our sub' 
ject went to McGill L^niversity, Montreal, and entered the medical depart- 
ment of that famous institution, from which he was graduated in 1879. He 
first began his professional life at Detroit, Michigan, going from there to 
Point Edward, Ontario, where he became surgeon for the Grand Trunk Rail- 
road. After practicing there a year he located at London, Ontario, and 
practiced his profession for five years. In 1885 he came to British Columbia 
and became one of the pioneer physicians of this locality. At that time the 
'Canadian Pacific Railroad was being constructed toward the west, through 
the Selkirk range of mountains, and he received the appointment of surgeon 
on the construction work. When the road was completed to the new town 
of Vancouver in 1887, Dr. McGuigan came to the place and has lived here 
ever since. 

During his early life in Vancouver he practiced both medicine and sur- 
gery, but of late years he has confined himself to medicine. He has been 
connected with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia 
ever since 1887, in various official and professional capacities. Twice he has 
acted as president and is now treasurer of the college, as well as member of 
the board of examiners, he having charge of the examinations in medical juris- 
prudence and materia medica. While located at London, Ontario, he was pro- 
fessor of botany and therapeutics in the Western University Medical School 
of that city. Dr. McGuigan was elected the first coroner of Vancouver, and 
has held that office ever since. He has been for six years a member of the 
city council from the third ward. In 1904 Dr. McGuigan was elected mayor 



612 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of Vancouver, and his administration has been highly commended by all. 
In politics he is an active Conservative, and fraternally he is a Knight of 
Pythias. Dr. McGuigan is also secretary and treasurer of the British ColumH 
bia McGill University Graduates Association. He has been and is now^ very 
prominent and popular and is closely identified with the history and growth 
of Vancouver from its beginning. 

CARL LOEWENBERG. 

Carl Loewenberg, the German consul at Victoria and a foremost busi- 
ness man of the city, has enjoyed a career of unusual progress and success 
in the enterprises which he has undertaken since arriving at manhood. He 
is noted for his eminent public spirit in helping along everything that per- 
tains to the welfare of Victoria, and is also a leader among the German 
citizenship of the city. 

He is himself a native of Germany, was born January 3, 1862, and is 
of good old German stock. He received his education in his native father- 
land, and immediately on completing his literary course in college he set out 
for British Columbia. In 1848 Leopold Loewenberg had emigrated from 
Germany to the land of gold and became interested in the real estate busi- 
ness in San Francisco. Ten years later, in 1858, he followed the trend 
of the gold-seekers to the Eraser river in British Columbia, and on that trip 
became satisfied of the great commercial prospects in store for the city of 
Victoria. He accordingly located permanently at Victoria and became the 
pioneer real estate man of the place. He effected many of the large real 
estate transactions, and administered many of the large estates of the 
city and vicinity, among others that of Sir James Douglas. He was 
prominent in the public aft'airs of his adopted city, was one of the organ- 
izers of the volunteer fire department, and in many ways his name is identified 
with the interests of Victoria during its early history. He is also remembered 
for his integrity of character and large personal influence. His death oc- 
curred in 1884. 

This honored Victoria pioneer citizen was the uncle of Mr. Loewen- 
berg, and the latter went to Victoria in '1879 to enter upon his business 
career in connection with this uncle. He remained with him for two years, 
and for the three following years was in the Bank of British Columbia. 
He was still loyal to the land of his birth, and he then returned to visit his 
relatives and also served his period of military duty. From Germany he 
went to France and remained a short time, and then returned to Victoria 
to continue his business enterprises. In 1888 he became a member of the firm 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 613 

of J. A. T. Caton and Company, importers of general merchandise and com- 
mission merchants. In 1893 Mr. Caton retired from this firm, and since 
then Mr. Loewenbergf has conducted the enterprise alone, and his business 
is now one of the important commercial features of the city. 

Mr. Loewenberg has always shown extreme interest in all the affairs 
of his city. He is a member of the board of trade of the province, and 
commercial advancement finds in him a ready helper. He has been consul 
of the German government in Victoria since 1891, and in this capacity has 
been able to render much valuable service to his native land and his fellow 
countrymen. In religion he holds to the faith of the Lutheran church, and 
is a valued member of the same. His business is large and successful, and 
he has made an enviable record in all the departments of his activity. 

. JOSEPH FOX. 

Joseph Fox, proprietor of the Windsor Hotel of Nanaimo, has enjoyed 
a varied and interesting career, passed in various parts of the American 
continent principally, and, though adversity and prosperity have played alter- 
nating parts throughout his endeavors, he has maintained himself undaunted 
in the face of difficulties and a persistent pursuit of higher ideals when 
fortune has favored, and his life is deserving of the high esteem shown him 
by his fellow citizens and hosts of friends and acquaintances. 

A native of Staffordshire. England, where he was born September 17, 
1863, a son of Thomas and Caroline (Jackson) Fox, both deceased, Mr., 
Joseph Fox, after a limited period of education in the English schools, began 
working in the limestone mines, and despite his tender years earned his 
daily bread at that occupation for four years. He was seventeen years old 
Vv'hen he decided to seek better opportunities in the new world, and in 1880 
he located at Pittsburg, state of Pennsylvania. After four months' work in 
the coal ' mines he went up to the Monongahela river coal mines, where he 
was employed three months. Thence he went to Kansas and mined coal in 
that state for eighteen months, and after a brief stay in the state of Indiana 
again located in Kansas. In May, 1883, he left Kansas and came out- to 
British Columbia. He worked in the mines at Wellington, and in the same 
year arrived at Nanaimo, where he was engaged in shaft-sinking and other 
mining work for some eight years. In November, 1892, he established the 
Palace Hotel, but after conducting this three years he sold and went to 
Cook's Inlet on a prospecting trip; came down to Juneau in the same year 
and for six months worked in the Treadwell mine, after which he returned 
to Nanaimo, where he was employed at various occupations. In 1897 he 



614 • BRITISH COLUMBIA 

went to the Slocan country, but returned to Nanaimo in March, 1898. In 
February, 1899, he set out on his last mining venture, when he went up to 
Yukon river in Alaska and prospected and mined for more than a year. Re- 
turning to Nanaimo in the fall of I9cx&gt;, he bought out the Windsor Hotel, 
and has conducted it ever since. The Windsor is unqualifiedly the leading 
hotel of Nanaimo, and under ]Mr. Fox's able management it has increased in 
attractiveness and comfort for the traveling public. Mr. Fox affiliates with 
Black Diamond Lodge, I. O. O. F. 

ADAM HENRY HORNE. 

Adam Henry Home, postmaster at Nanaimo, is a native son of the 
city and for the greater part of his active career has been one of its most 
influential and public-spirited citizens. He has been in the government service 
for over twenty years, and his long and efficient record is the best indication 
of his executive and administrative ability, his adroitness and dispatch in 
the handling of public matters, and his thoroughly grounded popularity among 
his fellow citizens. 

Born in Nanaimo, December 9, 1859, he is a son of the late A. G. Home, 
long one of the prosperous and well known men of the province, and of 
Elizabeth (Bate) Home, who is still living in Nanaimo. His education was 
acquired in the public schools but mostly under a private tutor. His first 
.activity in the practical business of life was as an employe of the Hudson's 
Bay Company, at Comox, being associated with his father, who was a factor 
of the great fur company. Somewhat later the firm of A. G. Home and 
Son was established at Nanaimo, a general merchandise business in which the 
son continued until he entered the government service in 1883, at which time 
he was appointed manager of the Dominion Government Savings Bank, and 
at the same time was assistant inspector of weights and measures. In 1890 
the savings bank was changed to the Postal Savings Bank, and in addition 
to being placed in charge of this institution he was also appointed postmas- 
ter of Nanaimo. 

In 1 88 1 Mr. Home was married to Miss Emily Cooper, a daughter of 
the present harbormaster at Nanaimo, Harry Cooper. Their happy home 
has been blessed with six children, as follows : Harry Grant, who is in the 
engineering department of the Princess Beatrice; Gertrude M., money-order 
clerk in the postoffice; Edith B., Gladys E., Esmie A. and Basil H. The 
family are Church of England people.

naimo, and also with the Woodmen of the World, and is a member of the 
Western Masons Mutual Life Association. 

WILLIAM SMITH. 

William Smith, the oldest living citizen in the municipality of Surrey, 
was born September 30, 182 1, at Niagara, Ontario, his parents' home being 
across the ravine near Brock's monument. He is a son of Edward and Eliza- 
beth (Taylor) Smith, the mother being a niece of General Taylor of Mexican 
war fame. The father was of Irish and English lineage, while his wife was 
of German descent, representing one of the old Knickerbocker families that 
were established in the state of New York in pioneer days. Edward Smith 
removed to Ontario in 1820 and later became a resident of Ohio, where his 
death occurred in the fall of 1826. His widow long survived him, passing 
away in 1894 at the advanced age of ninety-one years. 

When a lad of eight years William Smith began sailing on the Great 
Lakes as a cabin boy, and in due time became a sailor before the mast. When 
twenty-one years of age he was captain of the Rialto, sailing on the Great 
Lakes, and thus sixteen years of his life was passed. In 1849 he went to 
Illinois, where he followed railroading during the succeeding fourteen years 
on the Rock Island Railroad in Illinois and Iowa. Leaving that employ in 
1 87 1 he next went to Nebraska, where he remained for five years, conducting 
a general mercantile store there. He also built two grist mills and one saw 
mill in Nebraska and operated these with fair success. He also had a saw 
mill in Kansas, which he conducted for several years, meeting with a fair 
measure of prosperity. The next two years were spent in Edison, Washing- 
ton, where he was engaged in farming, and in 1885 he removed tO' British 
Columbia, locating at Cloverdale, which is in the heart of the Clover valley. 
Here he purchased a farm of four hundred and seventy acres, it being one of 
the most productive tracts of land in the province. He makes a specialty of 
the raising of oats and hay, harvesting about four thousand sacks of oats each 
year. 

In 1850 Mr. Smith was united in marriage to Miss Fannie Knight, and 
they became the parents of six children, of whom one is now deceased. The 
others are: W^alter, a resident of Kansas City, Missouri; Orion; Irvin B. ; 
Fanny, the wife of James M. Dale of Port Hammond, and May, the wife of 
Noah V. Wickersham, of Cloverdale. 

Mr. Smith owes his success in life to his own efforts. During his four- 
teen years in the railroad service he won continuous advancement and thus 



616 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

gained his first real start. He began working on the railroad at seventy-five 
cents per day and boarded himself, but after a few months he was making 
a dollar and a half per day, and for the last eight months of his service he 
was paid by the president eight thousand dollars as a bonus, his regular salary, 
however, being two hundred dollars per month. He is prosperous in his busi- 
ness undertakings in the northwest and his farming interests represent a large 
investment and bring to him annually a very desirable financial return. 

FRANK W. HALL, M. D. 

Dr. Frank W. Hall, physician and surgeon, is a practitioner of long 
standing in Victoria, having located in this city in 1885, and has since at- 
tained high rank in his profession. Dr. Hall's skill and ability have long 
been undisputed in this city, and his success as a surgeon is especially note- 
worthy, for it is to that branch of his profession that he gives most attention, 
although his general practice is also very large. 

Dr. Hall was born in the province of Ontario, February 10, 1861, and 
is of English and Irish ancestry. His father was Henry Hall, a native of 
Ireland, who in 1832, as a single man, emigrated to Toronto. A short time 
later his fiance. Miss Elizabeth Lennan, a native of Dublin, Ireland, also came 
across the waters, and they were married in this country. The father was 
a practical and successful machinist and foundryman, and he died at the 
age of fifty-seven years, but his good wife lived to be eighty-nine years old, 
not passing away until December, 1903. They were members of the Meth- 
odist church. 

Dr. Hall, the youngest of thirteen children, was educated in the Toronto 
literary schools, and his medical training was obtained in the Detroit Med- 
ical College, from which he was graduated with the degree of M. D. He 
was ardently ambitious for success and ability in his profession, and in order 
to feel better equipped he went to England and took lectures in London. In 
1885 he located in Victoria and began the practice which has since grown 
to such prosperous proportions and given him such high rank among his 
confreres. He has shown a higli order of skill in surgery, and for the suc- 
cessful practice of this branch he has all the modern and most approved ap- 
pliances. As everyone knows, the medical and surgical profession is not at 
a standstill, and to keep apace with its rapid progress and adaptation of 
new methods requires studious attention and first-rate ability. Dr. Hall has 
shown his fititess for his work again and again, and is as modern and as 
completely master of his science to-day as he was twenty years ago. He has 
erected for his own use principally a two-story brick block at 103 Yates 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 617 

street, and there has spacious and well furnished offices, with a full equip- 
ment of surgical instruments and paraphernalia. 

Fraternally Dr. Hall is an Odd Fellow and a Knight of Pythias. In 
politics he is a Liberal. 

WILLIAM CHARLES MORESBY. 

William Charles Moresby is one of Victoria's talented native sons, a 
member of the law firm of Moresby &amp; O'Reilly. He was born on the ist 
of June, 1876, and is descended from English ancestry. His parents were 
William and Mary Ann (Edwards) Moresby, both of whom were natives 
of England, the former born in London and the latter in Kent. William 
Moresby, the grandfather, came to British Columbia in 1858, but was not 
long permitted to enjoy his new home, his death soon afterward occurring. 
He had been a leading barrister in China during the Chinese war and other 
members of the family were in the British navy, his uncle. Sir Fairfax Moresby, 
being a rear admiral in the fleet. 

William Moresby came to British Columbia in 1862 and was at first 
engaged in the manufacture of lumber, but in 1868 was called to public serv- 
ice, being appointed warden of the provincial jail as successor to McBride 
and again in 1895 succeeded Mr. McBride in the wardenship of the state 
penitentiary. He was inspector of police in the mainland and was constantly 
engaged in arresting criminals, capturing over one hundred, of whom twenty- 
seven were hanged. He thus took a most active part in maintaining law 
and order by bringing culprits to justice and in the discharge of his duties 
he was fearless. He departed this life in 1896 in the forty-ninth year of 
his age. He and his wife were members of the Church of England and 
he was a charter member of the Westminster Masonic lodge. A man of high 
integrity and courage he commanded the respect and confidence of all with 
whom he was associated. His good wife survives him and is one of the 
noble pioneer women of the province. They were the parents of four chil- 
dren, three of whom are living : William Charles, Noel M. and Violet May, 
all at home. 

William C. Moresby pursued his education in New Westminster, at- 
tending school until he had mastered the branches of the high school course. 
He afterward became a student in Lome College. At the' age of fifteen he 
left school, however, and was afterward instructed by a private tutor for 
a year. Subsequently entering upon his business career, he engaged in 
clerking for a time in the employ of Armstrong, Eckstein and Gaynor, and 
later he was articled for five years to the law firm of Corbould, McColl, Wil- 



618 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

son &amp; Campbell. In December, 1897, he successfully passed his examination 
and was with one exception the youngest member of the bar of this district, 
he being then in his twenty-first year. After two months holiday he took 
charge of the office of Drake, Jackson &amp; Helmcken, with whom he remained 
until the 15th of May, 1904, at which time he formed his present partner- 
ship with Arthur J. O'Reilly. They have a wide professional acquaintance, 
have already secured a distinctively representative clientage and are giving 
the strictest attention to their legal business. Mr. Moresby prepares his 
cases with great thoroughness, is a close and earnest student of the principles 
of jurisprudence and always enters the courtroom well prepared to present 
his case in the strongest possible light. 

In his political views Mr. Moresby is a Conservative and was secretary 
of the Conservative Association. At its last meeting he received the largest 
vote for member of the executive committee and his influence is a potent 
factor in the councils of his party. Belonging to the Native Sons of the 
Province he is now a past chief factor, being the third to occupy that chair. 
He is also deeply interested in sports and athletics, including football, cricket 
and baseball, in all of which he excels. In the first named he has attained 
the highest proficiency and is the oldest known player actively connected with 
the league in this locality, having played continuously since his sixteenth year. 
He has been for two years on the managing committee of the James Bay Club. 
His perfect physical development, fine mental endowments and social, cordial 
nature render him a fine representative of British Columbia's Native Sons 
and his many excellent qualities have made him popular with a very large 
circle of friends.* 

DONALD B. HOLDEN, M. D. 

Donald B. Holden, M. D., during the past ten years or more has become 
recognized as one of the foremost physicians and surgeons of Victoria. He 
has a broad and liberal equipment, obtained in the best schools of this coun- 
try and abroad, and his skill has been often demonstrated in difficult surgical 
operations. Dr. Holden is -a leader not only in his immediate profession 
but also in various enterprises and social and civic movements in the city. 

Dr. Holden was born in Bellville, Ontario, October 13, 1867. The 
Holden family were among the earliest settlers at Bellville, and they first 
came there at the time of the American revolution. During this conflict they 
retained their allegiance to their king, and joined the exodus of loyalists to 
Canada. Bellville has since been the seat of the family, and its members are 
well known and prominent about that city. Dr. Holden's father was J. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 619 

Clement Holden, who was born near Bellville, and whose wife was Miss 
Emily Clark, a native of the same town. J. Clement Holden's early business 
career was spent as a druggist, but he later became a prosperous boot and 
shoe manufacturer at Montreal. He has branch houses at St. Johns, Toronto, 
Winnipeg, Vancouver, Victoria and Granby, and this is one of the old estab- 
lished and most successful business enterprises of Canada. The father is 
a Presbyterian in religion, but his good wife has always adhered to the sweet 
and simple doctrines of the Friends' church. They were the parents of six 
children, and two of them are in British Columbia, the Doctor and his brother, 
Fred C. Holden, the latter being a resident of Vancouver. 

Dr. Holden was educated at McGill University in Montreal, where he 
took both the B. A. and M. D. degrees, being graduated as a Doctor of 
Medicine in 189 1. He then went abroad and continued his professional studies 
in London and Edinburgh. He returned to this country, and in January, 
1893, opened his office at Victoria, where he was soon in possession of a 
large and influential practice, tie is also interested in several mining en- 
teprises. 

Dr. Holden is treasurer of the Victoria society for the prevention of 
cruelty to animals. If he has one special enthusiasm aside from his profes- 
sion it is his admiration for fine horses, and he takes great pride in the 
fine animals in his own stable. He is a member of the Presbyterian church 
in Victoria. He is a diligent student of his profession, gives his energies 
without reserve to his practice, and is a fine type of the professional man and 
public-spirited citizen. 

THOMAS STURCH ANN AND ALE. 

Thomas Sturch Annandale is known to hundreds of New Westminster 
families as " our grocer," and with all that such a title in this case implies 
it is a reputation of which any one might well be envied. And it is a fact that 
he owns and directs the most extensive grocery business in the city, purveying 
the very highest classes of provisions, and with a uniformity and reliability in 
quality and prices that retain and steadily increase the patronage which he has 
built up through the most honorable and effective business methods. Mr. 
Annandale is also one of the prominent citizens, possessed of the energy and 
civic enterprise which give strength and stability to any city or community, 
and his youth and ability have enabled him to accomplish much both for his 
own welfare and for the permanent progress of his city. 

Born in Forfarshire, Scotland, March 9, 1864, of Scotch ancestry, Mr. 
Annandale is a Scotchman by rearing and education and possessed of the 



620 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

best characteristics of that race. His parents were Robert Burns and Helen 
(Sturch) Annandale, both natives of the same town in Scotland, and his 
father was a prosperous man, being a manager of estates during his career. 
Both parents were members of the Church of England. 

After coming to this country Mr. Annandale spent some time in Van- 
couver. He arrived in New Westminster in 1891 and at once opened a small 
grocery, carrying on his trade in a small way in partnership with George 
Wolfenden. A year and a half later Mr. Annandale bought out his partn'^.r, 
and as sole proprietor devoted his energies to the business with such success 
that he soon built up a fine trade all over the city. Then came the great fire 
of 1898, in which the entire business section was wiped out. Two days and 
a half after that holocaust, and before the embers were scarcely cool, he had 
put up a small shack and as the first business man to resume business he began 
supplying the people with the necessaries of life. This prompt and energetic 
action gave added impetus to his trade when commercial activity was restored 
to its wonted prosperity, and he has since been the foremost grocer of the 
city. He conducts two large stores, the West End grocery being a branch of 
the central establishment. 

In politics a Conservative, Mr. Annandale has been offered the nomina- 
tion to both the provincial and Dominion parliaments, but business affairs 
have hitherto prevented his entrance into the active field of politics. Never- 
theless he is awake and public-spirited as concerns the best welfare of his city 
and province, and, possessing the confidence and esteem of his fellow citizens 
to an unusual degree, his influence counts for much in local matters. 

Mr. Annandale was married in 1887 to Miss Sarah Crowder, a native of 
Shropshire, England. This union has been blessed with four children, all 
born in New Westminster, namely : Beatrice, Lindsay, Thomas A. and 
Arthur. Mrs. Annandale died April 18, 1905. Mr. /Vnnandale is a member 
of the Church of England, as was also his wife. While a resident of England 
he received the sublime degree of Master Mason, and keeps up his fraternal 
relations in this country. 

JOHN C. HENDERSON, M. D. 

Dr. John C. Henderson is one of the representative physicians and 
surgeons in the New Westminster district, and at Chilliwack, where he has 
had his residence for nearly twenty years, he has built up a reputation for 
skill and professional ability which gives him an assured position of prom- 
inence among all his fellow citizens and associates. He came to this part of 
the province thoroughly grounded in all the principles which make the sue- 



p 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 621 

cessful practitioner, and, when added to this are his tact and social qualities, 
success was not long denied him, and he is now ranked among- the most influ- 
ential and prosperous men of his community. 

Dr. Henderson was born near Londonderry, Ireland, December lo, 
1853. his father being S. C. Henderson, a veteran contractor and builder now 
living in Chilliwack. From a fine literary education in the University of 
Glasgow, he passed to his professional studies in the same university and was 
graduated from the medical department in July, 1882. Tlie first four years 
of his professional career were spent in Eng'land, and he was most adequately 
equipped and experienced when he came out to this northwest country. His 
brother came out to Chilliwack in the early eighties, being a prosperous 
farmer there at the present time, and Dr. Henderson followed him in 1886. 
He became the pioneer doctor in the valley, and his ability speedily gained 
him a large business, which he has subsequently retained, and his practice 
extends all over the valley. 

In 1889 Dr. Henderson married Miss Frances Jane McCutcheon, a 
daughter of John McCutcheon, of Chilliwack. Their comfortable and pleas- 
ant home has been blessed with five children : Kathleen, Harold L., Will- 
iam Ewart, Dorothy and John Stanley. Dr. Henderson is a member of the 
Woodmen of the World, and he and his wife are Presbyterians. 

HENRY McDowell. 

Henry McDowell, president of the board of trade of Vancouver, is one 
of the city's most successful business men and also a pioneer and one who 
has taken a most prominent part in advancing the phenomenal prosperity 
of this city which is less than twenty years old. He is vice president of the 
large wholesale drug business of Henderson Brothers, Limited, which is 
the pioneer drug firm of the province. The drug business has claimed his 
attention during most of his career, and in this as in his other enterprises he 
has been eminently successful. 

Mr. McDowell was born in Milton, Halton county, Ontario, March 3, 
1862. His father, Robert McDowell, emigrated from Ireland, his native 
and ancestral country, to Canada in 1849, and in this country followed farm- 
ing until his death in 1864, when in his thirty-sixth year. He married, in 
his native country. Miss Mary Ann Doherty, who was born in the vicinity of 
his own birthplace. She reared their family and lived to be sixty-three years 
old, her death occurring in 1891. The parents were members of the Episcopal 
church. The son Henry and his sister, Mrs. Charles H. Monet, are both 
residents of Vancouver. 



622 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Educated in the public schools, Mr. McDowell learned the drug busi- 
ness in his native town, and in 1884 left Milton and went to Port Arthur at 
the head of Lake Suj^erior, where for two years he was a clerk in the employ 
of O'Connor and Company. In 1886 he came to Vancouver. Just 
previous to his arrival the fire fiend had destroyed all there had been in 
the way of a town, and in the year of his coming Vancouver had its real 
birth and baptism into a career of greatness. He opened a drug business, 
and his own interests and prosperity have kept pace with the rapid develop- 
ment of the city. His was the first drug store after the fire, and he con- 
tinued it on his own account until 1891, when he was joined by H. H. Wat- 
son. In 1895 their house was amalgamated with Atkins and Atkins, am 
this firm of McDowell, Atkins, Watson Company established as many as 
eleven drug stores in Vancouver, all located on eligible corners of the city| 
In 1903 they erected a large brick wholesale drug house, fifty by one hundred 
and twenty feet, and four stories and basement. In 1902 the wholesale busi- 
ness was merged with that of Henderson Brothers of Victoria, and the whole- 
sale trade is continued under the name of Henderson Brothers, Limited, while 
the retail houses are still conducted under the name of McDowell, Atkins, Wat- 
son Company. He has lohg been a member of the board of trade, and is at 
the present writing serving as its president 

In 1890 Mr. McDowell was married to Miss Dell Clarke, daughter of 
Edward Clarke, of Renbrooke, Ontario, and of Irish ancestry. Their three 
children are Mary Emily, Robert Clarke and Dell McLaren. They have one 
of the finest residences in Vancouver, and their church home is with the 
Church of England. 

JOHN McCUTCHEON. 

John McCutcheon, of Chilliwack, is a British Columbia pioneer of the 
year 1862, and has since had a long, varied and useful experience in the life 
and activities of the province and of the entire northwest coast. He has 
been noted for .his enterprise and able conduct of affairs, and has been a 
valuable factor in the progress and industrial welfare of the country. He 
has been a citizen of Chilliwack for many years, and here his worth has always 
been recognized and he is held in high esteem among his fellow men and 
business associates. 

A native of county Tipperary, Ireland, Mr. McCutcheon was a son of 
William and Jane Gunn McCutcheon, and was born January 8, 1842. His 
father is now dead, but his mother lives near Dallas, Texas. Prepared for 
life by a grammar school education in his native land, he took up serious 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 623 

duties by going out to Australia, where two year of his early life were spent. 
He came to British Columbia on the ship Mountain Wave, being in company 
with a lot of miners bound for the Cariboo district, and he made landing on 
September 27, 1862, an early date in the history of the province. Surveyor 
General Carey informed him and his companions that the wealth of the Cariboo 
district was grossly exaggerated, and by his representations he induced most 
of the men to remain near the coast and take up the more sure and settled 
pursuits of tilling the soil and such industries. The kindly official placed 
a gunboat at the disposal of the men and assigned them locations at various 
]X&gt;ints on the island, and some time later sent the gunboat around to pick up 
those who should prove to be dissatisfied. Mr. McCutcheon went to Comox 
and took up a hundred acres of land on the bay, on what is now known as Mc- 
Cutcheon's point, and where he was one of the factors in founding a 
settlement. This remained his home for two years, until his energies were 
devoted to tJie enterprises which have since occupied most of his time. In 
1864 he went on the expedition to run the Western Union telegraph line to 
Behring's straits, which was to cross to the Amoor river. In two years' 
time the line was pushed up as far as the Naas river, and he then returned 
to the Skeena river to take charge of the company's stores. The work was 
still in progress when word was received that the Atlantic cable had proved 
successful, and this stopped the enterprise. After remaining in that locality 
for a year and a half Mr. McCutcheon brought the stores back to Fort Simp- 
son in canoes and left them there until 1867. On his return to Victoria he 
was sent to take charge of the Whatcom office of the Western Union, and 
from that point came to Chilliwack, where he has been located ever since. 
He is the owner of two farms, one of one hundred and sixty acres and a mile 
from town, and one of eighty acres four miles from town, besides town 
property. 

Mr. McCutcheon was married in 1869 to Miss Caroline Mercy Morey, 
a daughter of Jonathan Morey of the Royal Engineers. The four children 
by this union are: Frances Jane, wife of Dr. John C. Henderson, of Chilli- 
wack; Sarah, wife of Robert Marshall, of Chilliwack; William Henry, who 
is on his father's farm; and John Francis. 

Mr. McCutcheon was the first reeve of Chilliwack, and held that posi- 
tion for several years, and is prominent and public-spirited in all community 
affairs. He is a Liberal in politics, and a member of the Episcopal church. 
He has fraternal affiliations with Excelsior Lodge No. 7, I. O. O. F. 



624 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

JOSEPH C. ARMSTRONG. 

Joseph C. Armstrong is a pioneer of the pioneers. He has been in- 
timately identified with the province of British Columbia since the spring of 
1858, and few men have a more varied acquaintance with the industrial, busi- 
ness and civic activities of the country than he. It is as a pioneer developer 
and successful operator in the gold fields that his history has its most interest- 
ing chapters, but his strenuous participation in those lines of work ceased 
some thirty-five years ago, and since then he has been by no means retired 
from the world, as the material prosperity and general welfare of his city of 
New Westminster can abundantly testify. He deserves to be counted among 
the leaders and stalwarts of his province, where he has backed by personal 
influence and effort civic enterprises, industrial growth and general progress. 

Mr. Armstrong comes of an old Irish family, being the third son of Cap- 
tain William Armstrong, who at an early date in the last century emigrated 
from county Cavan, Ireland, to Canada. For further details of the family 
history the reader is referred to the biography of Hon. William James Arm- 
strong, in another portion of this work. Mr. Armstrong was born in Dur- 
ham county, Ontario, April 18, 1837, and received his education principally 
at Millbrook, the county seat. 

The gold excitement of '49 attracted the entire family to the Eldorado 
on the Pacific slope, and in 185 1 they came west and settled in Grass Valley, 
Nevada county, California, where Joseph Charles had further privileges in the 
way of attending school. But during most of the seven years of his residence 
there has was engaged in mining, both placer and hydraulic, and he gained not 
only an infinite amount of experience, but also some money. 

In 1858 the Eraser river gold discoveries offered another field for the 
gold argonauts, and the Armstrongs joined in the rush for this district. From 
San Francisco they made the trip by sailing vessel to Victoria, where they 
arrived in the spring of the year. Victoria at the time boasted of being little 
more than a Hudson's Bay Company's trading point, the old fort being still 
in existence and the surrounding country densely wooded and undeveloped. 
From Victoria Mr. Armstrong and his brother George went on up the Eraser 
river to Langley. These hardy adventurers saw the heights and depths of 
mining and prospecting experience during the next few years. They made 
several trips up the river carrying their blankets and provisions on their backs, 
going as far as Hope. In 1861 they went to the Cariboo district in the sr.rnc 
way, loaded down with supplies and their mining equipment, making the 
journey by the Douglas route. Their first work, on Antler creek, was not 




V K I V 



v 



(1 '1 I .1 /. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 625 

very successful, but in the next spring they took up on WilHams creek what 
proved a very rich claim, from which during the two seasons of their .^tay 
they took out seventy-five thousand dollars. They packed their gold out with 
them, having it assayed in New Westminster and then shipped to San Fran- 
cisco. For three years after this successful work Mr. Armstrong remained 
in New Westminster and speculated in various properties. 

When the Big Bend excitement broke out in 1866 he was among the first 
to set out for the new field, but did not find success on this excursion, returning 
soon to New Westminster. In 1868 he once more went to the Cariboo region. 
He and his brother made a long and arduous search at different places, en- 
during countless difficulties and physical hardships in that wild country, where 
flour and beans were worth a dollar and a half a pound, and gum boots sold 
for fifty or sixty dollars a pair, so that the success which finally rewarded 
their efforts was well deserved. They discovered the famous Minnehaha claim 
on Mosquito creek, where, in company with several other parties, they took out 
a quarter of a million dollars. Some of their pans went as high as thirteen 
or fourteen ounces, and the richness and extent of this claim may be under- 
stood when it is stated that a part of it is being still worked by the Flynn 
Brothers. But expenses were very high when the Armstrong Brothers were 
there, and in 1869 Mr. Armstrong returned to New Westminster, without, 
however, disposing of all his interests in the mine. He concluded to give up 
the wearing occupation of prospecting and mining, which had given him ex- 
cellent rewards, but at the same time had compelled him to undergo severe 
privations. Three times he had footed it all the way from Yale to Cariboo 
and back, carrying his outfit on his back, and once he had made a similar 
journey to the Big Bend. 

Mr. Armstrong is known as the locator of the Harrison Hot Springs in 
New Westminster district, now one of the most popular resorts in the prov- 
ince. These springs were originally covered by the waters of the neighbor- 
ing lakes, and the piT)blem of separating the two was considered by all experts 
as insoluble. But Mr. Armstrong planned a cut between the lake and the 
springs which successfully met all expectations, and the fine medicinal waters 
have since been available to the public. At first he was the sole owner of the 
property and still retains a large share therein. A delightful hotel, the St. 
Alice, and baths have been erected, and, surrounded with its incomparable 
scenery, this is one of the beautiful and restful health and recreation spots of 
British Columbia. The water of the springs on leaving the ground is of a 
temperature of one hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit. The mineral com- 
bination is of the highest tonic and medical value, the analysis showing parts 



626 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of chloride of potassium, chloride of sodium, chlorides of lithium, sulphates 
of soda and magnesium, bicarbonates of lime and iron, and traces of sulphated 
hydrogen and other mineral and organic matter. 

Mr. Armstrong has been a permanent resident of New Westminster since 
1869, and has given most of his attention to dealing in various forms of real 
estate and promoting enterprises of the kind just mentioned. The brick 
blocks which he first built were burned in the great fire, and were afterwards 
rebuilt by him. He was prominent in the movement for putting in the first 
telephones in the city, and is still a stockholder in the company which controls 
all the telephones in the province. As a staunch Liberal Mr. Armstrong has 
been very active in public affairs, interested in provincial and Dominion 
politics, but always refusing to stand for parliament. He served ten years 
in the city council, and has been a supporter of every legitimate enterprise for 
the benefit of the city and locality. He is now serving as a member of the 
pilot commission. 

Mr. Armstrong's brother and long-time partner, George H. Armstrong, 
died on January 5, 1880, when thirty-seven years old. They had l^een as- 
sociated in all their prosperous days of mining*, and the bonds of sympathy 
and affection between them were unusually strong and sincere. One of their 
enterprises which should be recalled was the building, in 1874, of twenty-f'Xir 
miles of the Yale road, from Vedder lake to Cheam, and for this enterprise 
they employed one hundred white men and fifty Indians and received therefor 
thirty-five thousand dollars. 

November 5, 1885, Mr. Armstrong was happily married to Miss Cath- 
arine Freese, who was born in Calaveras county, California. They have two 
'children: Lillooet (which is the Indian word for beautiful) and Noel. Mrs. 
Armstrong's father was John E. Freese, a pioneer of California and British 
Columbia. 

DALLAS GORDON PERRY, M. D. 

Dr. Dallas Gordon Perry is a prominent young physician and surgeon 
at Duncans, and has been rising rapidly in his profession since entering upon 
its active practice some five or six years ago. He is a leader in his profes- 
sion, but is likewise a first class business man, and has entered heartily as a 
factor in various affairs in his community. 

Dr. Perry was born in Ottawa, Ontario, September 21, 1874, being a 
son of E. A. and Anne Jane (Cattenach) Perry, the former of whom is 
deceased, but the latter is living at Duncans. The family moved to Winni- 
peg when the son Dallas Gordon was seven years old, and he accordingly 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 627 

attended the public schools of that place. Thence he became a student of 
Manitoba College, from which he was graduated. His professional studies 
were carried on in the University of Manitoba Medical College, and he 
received his degree of Doctor of Medicine in the class of 1898. This prep- 
aration he followed up with a post-graduate course in the Chicago Post- 
Graduate School, and was then surgeon on the Canadian Pacific steamers 
to Australia for several trips. Becoming connected with the Dunsmuir 
Company at Wellington, British Columbia, he. served as colliery surgeon for 
two years, and in 1900 located at Duncans, where he has since remained and 
has been caring for a large and representative patronage. He is surgeon for 
the Mt. Sicker mines, and has large real estate interests in San Francisco. 
Dr. Perry affiliates with Temple Lodge No. 33, A. F. &amp; A. M., with 
the Western Gate Commandery, K. T., and with Gizeh Temple of the Mys- 
tic Shrine; and he has passed all the chairs of Duncans Lodge No. 17, L O. 
O. F. He is a member of the British Columbia Medical Association, the 
Canadian Medical Association, and his religious connections are with the 
Presbyterian church. 

O. ALLEN GRAHAM. 

O. Allen Graham, who is secretary of the British Columbia Pioneer 
Society, arrived in the province on the 13th of April, 1862: In the front 
rank of the columns which have advanced the civilization of the northwest, 
Mr. Graham has led the way to the substantial development, progress and 
upbuilding of British Columbia, being particularly active in the growth of 
Victoria, where he still m^kes his home. He is numbered among the pio- 
neers of British Columbia, his memory going back to the time when the 
entire Pacific coast was but very sparsely settled, when the Indians were 
more numerous than the white men, and the land had not been reclaimed 
for purposes of cultivation, but remained in the primitive condition in which 
it came from the hand of nature. 

Mr. Graham is a native of England, his birth having occurred in White- 
haven, Cumberland county, on the 22d of February, 1837, the year in which 
her royal majesty. Queen Victoria, was crowned. His grandfather, John 
Graham, was of Scotch ancestry, descended from an old Edinburg family. 
The father, Allen Graham, was born in Bothal, Cumberland county, Eng- 
land, in 1808, and having arrived at years of maturity he wedded Miss Jane 
Stables, a native of his own county, born in Edgemont. They were farm- 
ing people, active in their Christian life and exemplifying in their careers 
the principles that work for good and uprightness in every land and clime. 



628 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

He belonged to the Methodist church, while his wife was a communicant 
of the Church of England. 

Allen Graham, was educated at Edgemont and on putting aside his 
text books served a six years' apprenticeship in a grocery house. He was 
subsequently employed in different wholesale houses and still later became an 
accountant in the counting house of Peck Brothers, but the favorable reports 
heard concerning British Columbia attracted his attention and awakened a 
strong desire in him to enjoy the privileges of life on the Pacific coast. He 
therefore took passage for British Columbia, sailing from Liverpool to New 
York City, thence going by way of the Isthmus of Panama to San Fran- 
cisco and on to the Esquimault district. The place then had only a transient 
mining population, men who were attracted there by the hope of rapidly 
acquiring wealth, while a few others conducted business enterprises neces- 
sary to live in any community. Mr. Graham went to the mines on the 
Thompson river, but at first failed in his search to secure the precious metal. 
He then went to the Cariboo district, but his efforts there also ended in fail- 
ure. He then returned to Victoria, where he spent the winter, having charge 
of some business at the Seventy Mile House for the Harpers Brothers, at 
Clinton, large stock growers and also proprietors of flouring mills. Mr. 
Graham had charge of their business, also became their bookkeeper and con- 
tinued with them for six years. Subsequently he took up three hundred and 
sixty acres of land, lived thereon and improved the property, transforming 
the wild tract into richly cultivated fields, but in 1868 his house there was 
destroyed by fire. He had built a good two story frame residence and in 
the fire he lost not only his home but also his agricultural implements, and 
having no insurance his loss was a severe one. In 1871 he started for Omi- 
neca with a pack train and supplies . for the purpose of trading, but that 
country did not prove to be a resourceful mineral district and he was left 
with a large stock of goods on his hands, while many who had purchased 
and used his supplies left without paying him. Again, therefore, he suffered 
heavy losses. 

In 1885 Mr. Graham returned to Lome creek, for the country was al- 
most deserted in the district in which he had hoped to realize a good profit 
from merchandising. He had hopes of the building of the Canada Western 
Railway, but that projected enterprise was never carried forward to com- 
pletion. About this time Mr. Graham received the appointment of gold com- 
missioner on Lome creek and served in that office for two years or until 
the office was abolished. After this he was located on Skeene river at the 
canneries as store keeper, but as the fish industry, which was carried on 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 629 

extensively there, proved detrimental to his health he was obliged to abandon 
his efforts there and in 1891 he returned to Victoria, where he has been en- 
gaged in trading, bookkeeping and other business pursuits. He has for sev- 
eral years been the competent secretary of the British Columbian Pioneer 
Society, in which he has taken much interest and he has the credit of having 
been the prominent factor in the growth and upbuilding of this organiza- 
tion. He spends his time in Pioneer Hall, surrounded by the pictures of the 
dead and the living who bravely facing difficulties and dangers of frontier 
life have made the desert to bloom and blossom like the rose and made 
possible the high degree of civilization and prosperity that this part of the 
northwest now enjoys, planting many thousands of beautiful and happy 
homes surrounded by all that taste and refinement can secure. 

Mr. Graham is a valued member of the Independent Order of Odd 
Fellows and is serving as scribe of Vancouver Encampment. He has been 
an active working member of the Pioneer Society for the past thirty years, 
is a member of the Church of England and is one of the intelligent and 
respected early residents of British Columbia who for forty-two years has 
been an interested witness of the growth and progress of this section of the 
country, watching the province as it has emerged from pioneer conditions 
to take its place as the best improved districts of the Pacific coast country. 

THOMAS H. HENDERSON. 

Thomas H. Henderson, prominent in commercial circles at Chilliwack, 
has lived in the Chilliwack valley from the early days, when there were 
comparatively few settlers and agricultural and industrial development was 
hardly begun. Ranching and merchandising have been the lines along which 
he has directed his energies most successfully, and besides being an influen- 
tial participant in these departments of human endeavor he has lent his 
public-spirited interest and efforts to the progress and welfare of his com- 
munity. 

Lawrence, the state of Kansas, is Mr. Henderson's birthplace, and he 
was born April 10, 1859, during the stirring ante-bellum days in the states, 
when Kansas was a constant scene of tragedy and bloodshed. Mr. Hender- 
son is a son of Arthur C. and Rebecca (Hunter) Henderson, well known 
and highly respected citizens of Chilliwack. Mr. Henderson received a pu1&gt; 
lie school education and then took his college course at Baker University in 
Baldwin, Kansas. He has been a resident of Chilliwack since 1876, in 
which year he went on a ranch of one hundred and sixty acres with his 
father. In the following year he took up a ranch of one hundred and sixty 



630 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

acres on his own account, and this fine tract, which his subsequent efiforts 
developed to a high state of cultivation, remained in his possession until 1903. 
His father now owns two farms in the valley which he has purchased since 
coming here. After farming for about eight years Mr. Thomas H. Hen- 
derson, in 1884, went into partnership with his brother, the latter having 
established a general merchandise business in Chilliwack. This business has 
been carried on with great success for the past twenty years, and is now 
conducted under the name of A. C. Henderson, Mr. Henderson acting as 
manager. A large and complete stock of general merchandise is carried, 
and their trade extends all over the valley. 

Mr. Henderson was married in 1893 to Miss Isabella Maultsaid, a 
daughter of William Maultsaid, of Londonderry, Ireland. Mr. Henderson 
is a Liberal in politics, and a member of the Presbyterian church. 

L. A. LEWIS. 

L. A. Lewis, manager of the Burnette Sawmill Company, located at New 
Westminster, is in this connection controlling an important industry that con- 
tributes to the commercial activity of the town as well as to the general pros- 
perity of the stockholders. Through intense and well directed energy Mr. 
Lewis has risen to his present creditable position in trade circles, not placing 
his dependence upon any fortunate combination of circumstances, but molding 
business conditions until they have served his puqx)se, at the same time 
winning that respect which is accorded in recognition of allegiance to high 
principles and ethical commercial relations. 

Mr. Lewis was born in Hagersville. Ontario, on the 27th of March, 1864, 
and is of Welsh ancestry. His father, Lewns Lewis, was born in Wales and 
leaving the little rock ribbed country of his birth became a resident of Canada 
when a young man. He settled in Hamilton and was married there to Miss 
Mary N. Hopper, a native of Ontario. A contractor and builder, he was 
identified with construction work throughout his entire business career, thus 
providing for his family. He and his wafe held membership in the Methodist 
church and he died in that faith in the seventy-third year of his age, while 
his w'ife, surviving him, is now, in 1904, in her seventy-fourth year. 

L. A. Lewis was educated in Dresden, Ontario, and in the commercial 
College at London, Ontario, and when he had put aside his text books he en- 
tered upon his business career as manager of a private bank in Dresden, On- 
tario, continuing in that position for a number of years. He came to New 
Westminster in 1887 and was for six months in the employ of the Royal City 
mills. He then came to his present company in the capacity of cashier and 




'&gt;n\\ 1 
' I'f h u I 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 631 

bookkeeper and filled that position until 1897, when he was made general man- 
ager and secretary of the Burnette Sawmill Company, which was organized 
in 1878 by the DeBeck Brothers, who continued in the management of the 
business until 1888, when the present company became the owners. The offi- 
cers are Hugh McDonald, president, and L. A. Lewis, general manager and 
secretary. The mill has a capacity of one hundred thousand feet of lumber 
in ten hours. The same gentlemen constitute the Dominion Shingle Com- 
pany, engaged in the manufacture of shingles, and the capacity of this plant 
is one hundred thousand shingles in ten hours. They received a diploma for 
the best shingles at the Provincial fair in 1904. They manufacture all kinds 
of house finishing materials, including moldings and trimmings, and also deal 
in doors, sash and blinds. The company owns all of the tug boats used in 
connection with the business and tows all of the logs from up the Fraser river 
and far up the coast for a distance of two hundred miles. The Burnette Saw- 
mill Company also manufactures large quantities of boxes, having a capacity 
of five thousand daily. They have the only nailing machine west of Toronto, 
and they are the only firm in British Columbia that manufacture dovetail 
boxes. They also have the most complete printing press for printing labels 
for boxes in British Columbia and they enjoy a large trade throughout the 
northwest and extending eastward to Toronto and Quebec. Mr. Lewis has 
from the beginning been manager and secretary of this extensive and success- 
ful industry, and is also one of the stockholders and directors. 

In his political views Mr. Lewis is a Conservative. He takes an active 
interest in all the affairs of the country, being" earnestly desirous of its pro- 
motion along" lines of material, political, intellectual and moral progress. He 
is the president of the New Westminster board of trade and is a director and 
one of the executive officers of the Royal Agricultural Society. 

In 1892 Mr. Lewis was married to Miss Nettie Dockrill, a native of On- 
tario and a daughter of Joseph Dockrill, of Port Moody, British Columbia.

J. HOWE BENT. 

J. Howe Bent has been closely identified with the business activity, espe- 
cially along the lines of real estate and insurance, in Chilli wack, since 1888, 
and, being a successful and well prospered man himself, he has also given 
his influence to the advancement and general progress of the town and com- 
munity. Being now a man of nearly three score and ten, his career has been 
filled with activity from the time of boyhood, and, having gained a due 
meed of prosperity, he is on the threshold of a contented and enjoyable old 
age. 

Mr. Bent was born September 27, 1835, in Annapolis county, Nova 
Scotia, where his parents, Israel L. and Hannah (Bath) Bent, now de- 
ceased, resided for a number of years. After a period of attendance in the 
common schools and the high school at Bridgetown, he became a clerk in 
his uncle's store at St. Johns, New Brunswick, and a short time later went 
to another uncle who had a dry goods business at Halifax, where, during his 
stay of several years, he acquired valuable business experience. His next 
enterprise was shipping timber from, Cape Breton. Taking a good-sized 
cargo of various kinds of produce and provisions, he then went to England, 
and during three years of commercial exploitation he opened up an English 
market for produce, and then returned to the Dominion. In 1880 he went 
to Brandon, Manitoba, and after farming a year opened a grocery business 
which he conducted successfully for six years. He was compelled to relin- 
quish this enterprise because of ill health, and he then came out to Van- 
couver, where he was engaged in the real estate business for two years. In 
1888 he came to Chilli wack and bought four hundred and twenty acres of 
land for himself and a brother-in-law. He has since sold some of this and 
now retains about one hundred acres. In Chilliwack he conducts a general 
real estate and insurance business, and during his residence here he has been 
the agent of numerous transactions along these lines, being a reliable busi- 
ness man and having gained a well deserved success. 

Mr. Bent was married in 1862 to Miss Lavina De Wolf, a daughter 
of William H. De Wolf, of Nova Scotia. Mr. Bent is a Liberal in politics, 
and the family are Methodist. 

SAMUEL ARTHUR CAWLEY. 

Samuel Arthur Cawley is a well known real estate dealer at Chilliwack, 
and has gained a commendable success in this enterprise and at the same time 
has made himself a useful factor in developing the material resources of his 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 633 

locality and promoting the growth and prosperity of one of the most fertile 
and wealthy districts of the province. He has spent all his adult life, cover- 
ing a period of more than a quarter of a century, in British Columbia, and 
his varied undertakings have brought him into prominence as a citizen and 
business man. 

Born in Brant county, Ontario, November 29, 1858, a son of Samuel 
and Isabella (Falconer) Caw^ley, both deceased, Mr. Cawley received his 
early education in the public schools of his native county. The home farm 
was a scene of rugged and useful training during the first twenty years of 
his career, and at that age, in 1878, he came out to British Columbia. He 
purchased land and farmed in the Chilliwack valley until 1890, and then 
sold out his farming interests and engaged in the hardware business in 
Chilliwack, carrying on this line of trade until he sold to C. B. Reeves in 
1896. He then began mining in the Harrison river district, but after con- 
tinuing at that a few years he opened up the real estate, insurance and min- 
ing business in Chilliwack which he is still conducting. 

Mr. Cawley is a Conservative in politics, and a member of the Church 
of England. Fraternally he affiliates with Ionic Lodge No. 19, A. F. &amp; A. 
M.. with Excelsior Lodge No. 7, I. O. O. F., and with L. O. L.. Lodge No. 
1470. He was married in 1882 to Miss Emma Reeves, a daughter of 
Amran Reeves, of Chilliwack and formerly of Norfolk county, Ontario. 
They have four children, Maud, Ethel, Elwyn and Doris. 

HENRY F. HEISTERMAN. 

Henry Frederick Heisterman, in whose death Victoria lost one of its 
worthiest citizens, was a man of rare capacity who in his day was among 
the foremost in developing the business and municipal interests of the city. 
His native talent led him out of humble circumstances to large worldly suc- 
cess through the opportunity that is the pride of our American life. Nor 
was his success to be measured by material standards alone. He developed 
that type of character which makes for higher ethical ideals in business and 
in society. He knew the life of the people and he kept a warm and sympa- 
thetic heart for the unfortunate and oppressed. He took a keen interest in 
Victoria's growth, giving active support to many measures for general prog- 
ress and improvement and further, in his business relations and dealings, 
he applied the principles of his private life. 

Mr. Heisterman was born in Bremen, Germany, on the 22d of July, 
1832, and was descended from a highly respected old German family. He 
acquired his early education in his native country and when eighteen years 



^34 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of age he removed to Dantzic, where for three years he was engaged in 
commercial pursuits. In 1853 he removed to Liverpool, England, where he 
was engaged in the commission husiness, in which he continued until 1862, 
and while there he became a citizen of Great Britain, to which country he 
ever afterward gave his allegiance. Attracted to the Pacific coast by the 
gold excitement, in August, 1862, he landed at Victoria, and soon after- 
ward started with others for Stikeen. He had the misfortune, however, to 
lose his canoe and whole outfit, including his supply of provisions, and he 
returned to Victoria with very little money. Neither had he employment, 
but he soon afterward established a reading room and a chamber of com- 
merce, and in this venture met with fair success. After conducting the 
business for six months he sold out and began dealing in paints and glass, 
in partnership w'ith John Banks. Eight months later the partnership was 
dissolved and Mr. .Heisterman, in 1864, turned his attention to the real 
estate business, in which he met with almost immediate success, his client- 
age steadily growing until he was conducting a real estate business second 
to none in the province, negotiating the large majority of the important 
realty transactions in Victoria and the surrounding districts. He became 
largely interested in city property on his oaVu account, making investment 
as he saw opportunity to purchase judiciously, with promise of speedy rise 
in valuation. He built one of the first fine residences in this now beautiful 
city of splendid homes, and the business and the home are still in posses- 
sion of his family. Through the avenue of his business he had opportunity 
to promote the upbuilding and substantial improvement of the city and his 
deep interest in Victoria and its growth was not a minor consideration with 
him in his business transactions. He also extended his efforts to the field 
of insurance and represented many of the largest and most reliable insur- 
ance companies. In 1884 he admitted G. W. Haynes to a partnership in 
the business and this relationship was maintained until the death of Mr. 
Heisterman, which occurred on the 29th of August, 1896, when he was in 
the sixty-fifth year of his age. 

In 1872 Mr. Heisterman was united in marriage to Miss Laura Adams 
Haynes, a daughter of Perly Haynes, of the state of Maine. They became 
the parents of seven children, six of whom, together with the mother, sur- 
vive the husband and father. The sons and daughters are : Laura Agnes, 
now the wife of D. R. Ker, of Victoria; Sylvia L., the wife of R. E. Brett, 
of Victoria; Verna A., the wife of Arthur G. Smith; Olive Irene, at home; 
Henry George Sanders, who is practicing law in Victoria; and Bernard S., 
who is managing the real estate business.

BRITISH COLUMBIA' 635 

Mr. Heisterman was a very active and valued worker and member of 
St. Andrew's Presbyterian church and he took a deep interest in the educa- 
tional affairs of the city, serving for a number of years as a member of the 
board of school trustees. He was also a member of the board of trade from 
the time of its organization until his death and he was a very prominent rep- 
resentative of Masonry in Victoria, having taken the degrees of the York 
rite and become a member of the Commandery. He filled many of the 
ofitices in the order and was grand secretary of the grand lodge of the prov- 
ince. He was likewise a valued member of the Pioneer Society and a citi- 
zen who enjoyed the confidence of a very wide circle of friends. His name 
should be enduringly inscril&gt;ed on the list of the founders and promoters of 
Victoria. 

BERNARD S. HEISTERMAN. 

Bernard S. Heisterman, who has demonstrated his right to rank with 
the leading young business men of Victoria, was born in this city in 1873, 
and is a son of the late Henry Frederick Heisterman, whose history is given 
above. He acquired his education in the public schools of his native city 
and from his youth was more or less closely associated with his father's 
business, assuming a greater portion of the management as age and experi- 
ence qualified him for the onerous duties involved in its successful conduct. 
Upon his father's death he assumed charge of both the real estate and 
insurance business and is now the senior member of the firm of Heisterman 
&amp; Company, being associated at the present time w-ith James Forman. This 
is one of the oldest established real estate enterprises of the city and is 
known throughout the province because of the scope and importance of 
the business carried on. 

Mr. Heisterman resides in the fine homestead with his mother. Like 
his father he is a leading and influential' member of St. Andrew's Presby- 
terian church, of which he is now serving as treasurer, and in the various 
church activities he takes a helpful part. He is also a Sir Knight Templar, 
a member of the Mystic Shrine, and an esteemed representative of the Native 
Sons of the Province. 

JOHN REID. 

John Reid, of New Westminster, has made a career of large and broad 
success. He is not only one of the prominent business men and manufacturers 
of his city, but has a variety of other interests identifying him with the com- 
munity and province as an active factor in public and semi-public affairs. His 
principal business is as proprietor of a large machine and blacksmithing busi- 



636 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ness. Industry, persevering energy, strict adherence to honorable business 
methods, and general ability in all his undertakings have characterized his suc- 
cess, and it has been a thing of personal achievement with him, for he has 
progressed from one point to another with a steadiness and sureness that in- 
dicate the character of the man rather than any chance good fortune. 

Born at Carrickfergus, country Antrim, Ireland, March 28, 1852, of old 
Scotch ancestry, he was a son of Ezekiel and Mary (Neeson) Reid, both na- 
tives of that country, farmers by occupation, and honored and esteemed mem- 
bers of the Presbyterian church and of their community, in which they spent 
all their lives, the mother dying at the age of sixty-eight and the father at 
eighty-two. 

Mr. Reid was educated at his native town, and remained at home and 
assisted to work the farm until he was twenty-one years old. In 1873 he 
emigrated to Canada, and then settled at Ottawa, and there made the be- 
ginning of his prosperous industrial career. In Ottawa he began learning the 
iron foundry business, working at the trade there for four years. He was 
then employed in the construction of the city water works and also on the 
parliament buildings. In 1877 he left Ottawa and came direct to Victoria, 
and thence to New Westminster, where for two years he was a journey m.an 
and for seven years foreman in the business of Mr. W. R. Lewis. In 1886 he 
bought out Mr. Lewis, and continued the business with Mr. W. Curry as 
paHner. The enterprise grew rapidly, soon expanding to a carriage manu- 
factory, an iron foundry and a machine shop. The partnership was dissolved 
in 1893, and in the following year Mr. Reid opened up the business as sole 
proprietor, having continued it so for the subsequent ten or more years. His 
shop is thoroughly equipped with machinery and is run by electric power. 

With the ideals of good citizenship always present with him, Mr. Reid 
has taken an active interest in local, provincial and Dominion politics. In 
1887 he was elected alderman of St. Andrew's ward in his city. He was re- 
elected in 1888, but owing to an irregularity the election was declared void, 
and his second candidacy was unsuccessful owing to his firm stand upon the 
Sunday closing law. In 1889 he was elected an alderman under the new city 
charter, and while in the city council served as chairman of the fire and light 
committee. He has also served on the city school board for a number of 
years, and also on the library commission board. In 1878 Mr. Reid joined 
the provincial militia, at first being with the Seymour Artillery, later with the 
Fifth Regiment, and now with the Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles. He has 
held the office of color sergeant. Mr. Reid is one of the best riflemen in the 
province, and has often contested with the other crack shots of the militia. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA' 6S7 

In 1883 Mr. Reid was happily married to Miss Jessie Irving, who was 
born in Oxford county, Ontario, a daughter of Adam Irving, of Maple Ridge. 
They have a fine family of seven sons and daughters, all native born in New 
Westminster, namely : William Irving, Mary Elizabeth, G. May, Catherine, 
John Albert, Sidney James and Robert Stanley. Their home is one of the 
many fine residences for which the city is noted, and hospitality and the social 
graces are permanent characteristics of the Reid household. They are mem- 
bers of the Methodist church. Mr. Reid has served as captain of the uni- 
formed rank of the Knights of Pythias, and is a member of the Woodmen of 
the World. 

WILLIAM PENN JAYNES. 

William Penn Jaynes, the well known merchant of Duncans, has been 
a pioneer in numerous important enterprises in the Cowichan district of 
British Columbia, and his identification with so many phases of the life and 
activity of his locality has eventuated not only in prosperity for himself 
but in wholesome progress and advancement to the entire community of 
which he is a part. He has been at Duncans nearly twenty years, and in the 
district over a quarter of a century, and his career, though varied, has been 
extremely successful and honorable. 

Mr. Jaynes was born in Gloucester, England, November 6, 1846. His 
father, Edwin Jaynes, is deceased, and his mother, Charlotte (Hill) Jaynes, 
is living in Folkstone, England. Educated at the Crypt grammar school 
and at King's College in Gloucester, Mr. Jaynes then entered the corn and 
provision trade, which he continued for eight years. He came out to the 
Dominion and located at Barrie, Ontario, in 187 1. At Barrie he engaged 
in the steamboat business, building the first steamboat ever constructed at 
that town, the craft being launched in Lake Simcoe, May 24, 1874, and 
some years later being burned in Lake Superior. Mr. Jaynes came out to 
British Columbia in 1878 to take charge of the lumber interests of Messrs. 
Sutton and Company on Cowichan lake. He had been there but a short 
time when he established a store at Quamichan. At that time there were 
only twelve white men in the district, from which fact it is evident that he 
was there during the pioneer period, and has been a witness to all the subse- 
quent development. In 1886 he established his general merchandise store 
at Duncans, and has since made this place the center of his operations. He 
carries thirty thousand dollars' worth of stock in his store, and has one of 
the most representative and extensive trades of any similar concern in the 
province. 



638 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

As has been noted, he was prominent in various business undertakings. 
He was the first man to estabHsh a creamery in the district, being its first 
president, and was also manager of the Cowichan creamery, which now oc- 
cupies the first place among butter-making concerns in the province. He 
was the first person to introduce thoroughbred Jerseys into the district, and 
thus set an ideal standard in creamery enterprises. He imported his stock 
from Flood of Menlo Park, California, and at the present time he main- 
tains a fine herd of about thirty head of thoroughbred animals of this strain. 
Mr. Jaynes also erected the first feed and grist mill in the district, and was 
the pioneer in this as in other industries. In the more public affairs of his 
community he has likewise been an enterprising factor. For eighteen years 
he served as postmaster of Duncans, and was secretary of the board of edu- 
cation for sixteen years. In politics he is Conservative. He is a member 
of the Church of England, and fraternally is associated with the Knights 
of Pythias. 

Mr. Jaynes was married in 1870 to Miss Clara Reed. Her father, 
William Reed, of England, was chief engineer of the government railways 
in Brazil. Seven children have been born to the household of Mr. and 
Mrs. Jaynes, as follows : Florence married J. H. Whittome, of Duncans ; 
Ada Isabel married Ernest Price, of Cowichan Lake; Louise is the wife 
of Edward Hicks Beach, a nephew of the famous Sir Michael Hicks B'each ; 
Beatrice ; Percy, who is manager of the Windmill farm of Cowichan ; John 
James, in college at Victoria ; and Philip, at school in Duncans. 

FREDERICK McBAIN YOUNG. 

Frederick McBain Young, a prominent representative of the British 
Columbia bar engaged in practice at Nanaimo, has been located in this city 
since 1892 and has achieved a large degree of professional success. He is 
also interested in public and political affairs, and both in civic and private life 
is recognized as a man of eminent public spirit, invincible integrity, and high 
personal worth and character. 

Born in the city of Montreal, he was the son of a Presbyterian minister, 
Alexander Young, now deceased, and his mother, Ellen (McBain) Young, 
is living in Nanaimo. After completing the work of the Montreal public 
schools Mr. Young took his college course at Queen's University in King- 
ston. He began his law studies with Deroche and Madden at Napanee, 
Ontario, and then went to Toronto, where he articled himself to the firm 
of Morphy and Miller, with whom he continued his preparation until his ad- 
mission to the bar in 1889. In 1892 he came out to British Columbia and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 639 

located at Nanaimo, where he has since been busied with the care of a 
growing' and profitable legal practice. 

Mr. Young affiliates with Doric Lodge No. i8, A. F. &amp; A. M., and was 
grand master of the province for the term 1901-1902. His religious adher- 
ence is W'ith the Presbyterian church. In 1893 Mr. Young was married to 
Miss Mary Glaholm, whose father, Thomas Glaholm, is connected with the 
firm of A. R. Johnson and Company of Nanaimo. Two children have been 
born to Mr. and Mrs. Young, Alexander McBain and Marguerite Glaholm. 

ALBERT T. GOWARD. 

Albert T. Goward is best known to the citizens of Victoria as the man- 
ager of the British Columbia Electric Railway, and it is interesting to know 
that he attained to this position entirely by merit, personal efficiency and 
well directed energy. Mr. Goward is a native of South Wales, England, 
born in Pembrokeshire, April 4, 1872, being of English ancestry, and his 
father was a native of Market Harbo rough, Leicestershire, and is now the 
librarian in the Victoria city library. The religious faith of the family is 
Protestant. Mr. Goward received his early education in private schools, 
and for three years was in the insurance business in Bristol and London. 
He came out to Victoria in 1890, being still a young man just starting in 
life, and without any large past success or capital to back him. In Victoria 
he became connected wnth the company which he still serves, beginning as a 
street car conductor. He worked industriously, became familiar with all 
the details of the system, and as a result was rapidly promoted from one 
position of responsibility to another until he reached that of manager of 
the company's business in Victoria, an office which he has most successfully 
filled for the past five years. It controls the street raihvays in Vancouver, 
Victoria and New Westminster, the electric lighting in the three cities, and 
the gas works in Vancouver and Victoria. This is a business record of which 
any man might be proud, and Mr. Goward's w^ork and influence in behalf of 
Victoria are of daily benefit to every citizen and business interest. 

The British Columbia Electric Railway is a progressive enterprise. 
There are, under its ownership and direction, sixteen miles of street railway 
in and about Victoria, and an equipment of thirty cars take care of the 
traffic. The company manufacture their own electric energy, obtaining 
power from Coldstream, thirteen miles from the city, and also from the 
Esqnimault water works. The company also owns and operates a plant for 
the electric lighting of Victoria with the exception of the street lights, and 
three thousand customers are furnished with light from their dynamos. The 



640 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

old tramway company of Victoria went into liquidation some years ago, and 
their franchise was then purchased by the British Columbia Company, which 
has developed the old system and renovated the entire equipment in such 
effective manner that the Victoria street railway system will compare most 
favorably with any system of the west or northwest. The company has 
recognized the tendency toward cheaper fares, and one ticket entitles the 
holder to transfers over all the lines of the city. Six fares are sold for 
twenty-five cents, and between six and nine o'clock in the morning and four- 
thirty and seven in the evening workmen pay twenty-five cents for eight 
rides, so that the street railway is a great public servant, not a greedy despot. 
When the present system was purchased the old steam plant was thrown out, 
and natural power generation introduced; the entire line of track was relaid 
with fifty-six pound T rails. A number of the cars are forty feet in length,- 
and the system is up-to-date and entirely satisfactory to the people of Vic- 
toria. 

Mr. Coward was married on July 12, 1904, to Miss F. T. Clarkson, of 
Bristol, England. Her father was the late Rev. William Clarkson, a min- 
ister of the Congregational church. Mr. Coward is a member of the boara 
of trade of Victoria, and in every possible way aids in the progress and de- 
velopment of the city. 

WESLEY EDGAR VANSTONE. 

Wesley Edgar Vanstone, principal factor in the Vanstone Heating and 
Plumbing Company, Limited, one of the prosperous manufacturing concerns 
of New Westminster, has been a leading man of affairs in New Westminster 
during the past fifteen years. Beginning his career without special advant- 
ages or capital, he has made his way to a well deserved success through the 
exercise of his own inherent powers and ability. 

Mr. Vanstone was born in Kincardine, Ontario, in 1868, a son of Josiah 
and Anne (Sturgeon) Vanstone. His father was a native of Devonshire, 
England, and his mother came from the north of Ireland. Mr. Vanstone at- 
tended the common and high schools of his native town of Kincardine, but 
his school days came to an end when he was thirteen years old, and thence- 
forth he came into contact with the severe and practical side of life. In 1889 
he came to British Colunili?, locating at New Westminster, and there engaged 
in government contract work for the firm of E. S. Scouler and Company. In 
1 891 he began the plumbing and heating business, and this was continued with 
increasing success until in 1904 the incorporation took place under the name 
of the Vanstone Heating and Plumbing Company, Limited. The trade ex-

BRITISH COLUMBIA 641 

tends throughout the ]3rovince, pnd there is a branch house at Vancouver. 
The heating plant which is the specialty of this company and the introduction 
and sale of which are its principal objects, is the device and invention of Mr. 
Vanstone, and was patented by him. He has made it the basis of a most 
prosperous business, employing' upwards of thirty men. 

Outside of private affairs Mr. Vanstone has displayed his civic usefulness 
in various ways. He has served three terms in the city council since 1901, 
and for the past three years has been chairman of the light committee in the 
council. Fraternally he is affiliated with the Masons. 

Mr. Vanstone was married in 1893 to Miss Jennie Swalwell, who was 
born in Quebec, a daughter of Richard Swalwell. Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone 
have three children : Lillian, Charles and Russell. 

HENRY NELEMS. 

Henry Nelems, of Chilliwack, was an early pioneer of this fertile valley, 
but has spent most of his subsequent, as he had his previous, career in On- 
tario, whence he has in recent years returned to this favored farming region 
of British Columbia and established himself in comfortable and enterprising 
style in the Chilliwack valley. Mr. Nelems is a man of broad ability, and 
has been successful in the different enterprises which have engaged the en- 
ergies of his active career. He has also found time to devote to matters 
of community interest, and is a reliable and public-spirited citizen whenever 
his services are required. 

Mr. Nelems was the son of an Ontario farmer, William Nelems, and his 
wife Eliza (Gay) Nelems, both ot whom are now passed away. Mr. Henry 
Nelems was born in Oxford county, Ontario, December 21, 1844, and at- 
tended the public schools of his native county and worked on the home farm 
until he was twenty years old. He then went west, and after spending 
some eight months in the vicinity of Elk Grove, Sacramento county, Cal- 
ifornia, he came to Chilliwack in 1865, and in 1868 he purchased a farm of 
two hundred and fifty acres in the valley. He conducted this only a short 
time until he sold it and returned to his native Oxford county. There 
he was prosperously engaged in farming for twenty-two years, after which 
he established himself at Woodstock, Ontario, and engaged in the shipping 
of horses and machinery, and he also conducted a retail store three years. 
In 1899 he sold out and returned to Chilliwack, and bought a farm of fifty- 
five acres one mile from town, where he maintains an up-to-date establish- 
ment in every way, and on his place may be found an excellent exemplifica- 
tion of modern agriculture in its various departments. 



642 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. Nelems affiliates with the Ancient. Order of United Workmen, and 
in pohtics is a Liberal. He and his family are Baptists. While a resident 
of East Oxford and of Woodstock, Ontario, he served as city councilman. 
By his first marriage in 1872 to Miss Sarah Jane Davis, a daughter of 
James Davis, of Oxford county, he had three children, namely : Ada, who 
died aged eight years; Melbourne and Roy. In 1892 he married Miss Isa- 
bella Howell, a daughter of William Howell, of Brantford, Ontario. They 
are both held in high esteem in the social circles of their community, and have 
enjoyed friendship and respect wdierever their lives have been passed. 

JUSTINIAN PELLY. 

Justinian Pelly, barrister at Chilliwack, has been a resident and an active 
participant in the affairs of British Columbia during the past two decades, 
and during his ten years' practice of the law has risen rapidly to a high rank 
in the legal circles of the province. He had already demonstrated his ex- 
ecutive and business ability before turning his attention to the law, and his 
subsequent career has been a record of steady advancement to prominence in 
a profession wdiere individual merit and enterprising endeavor are the prin- 
cipal factors in success. 

Mr. Pelly was born in Essex, England, May 21, 1864, being a son of 
Justinian Pelly, now deceased, and Fanny (Ingleby) Pelly, who is living in 
Gloucestershire, England. He was w^ell educated, having the advantages

northern part of the province. In 1887 he w^as employed on a snow-shed 
survey for the Canadian Pacific Railroad. In the fall of 1888 he articled 
himself to Corbould and McColl, barristers of New Westminster, and after 
a thorough grounding in the theoretical and practical principles of law and 
jurisprudence he was admitted on July 31, 1893, and at once established him- 
self in practice at Chilliwack, where he has remained to the present time, 
and has been busied with the care of a growing and profitable practice.

LOUIS STEMLER. 

Louis Stemler is the proprietor of the Pioneer Coffee and Spice Mills 
of Victoria, which he established in 1875 and which have been run with 
continuous and increasing success since that year. Mr. Stemler is a fine 
type of business man, progressive and enterprising, but so thoroughly hon- 
orable in all his methods of conducting business that the trade that once comes 
to him always remains. It is a matter of much satisfaction to him and a 
sure evidence of his reliability and high reputation in the city that a number 
of his customers are those who started to trade with him nearly thirty years 
ago and have never found a better place to buy their goods. Mr. Stemler 
selk his goods both to the retail and the wholesale trade, and his market 
extends through British Columbia, the Northwest Territory and the Yukon 
district. His special brands, which are so well known and have such large 
demand, are the Grand coffees, the Star spices, and the Hygenia baking 
powder. He manufactures his own boxes and cans, and for purity and high 
grade his products cannot be excelled. 

Mr. Stemler is a native of Germany, where he was born October 25, 
1845, coming of good native stock and lineage. His father, Frederick Stem- 
ler, left the fatherland and came out to the Pacific coast as a California 
forty-niner, and thence, in 1858, was attracted north to the Eraser river 
excitement. He lived to be seventy-three years of age, and was one of the 
l^est Vnown and most highly respected pioneers of the west and northwest. 
He was a Lutlieran in religious faith, and his life and works were upright 
and honorable. 

Mr. Stemler is now the only member of the family in British Columbia. 
He was reared and educated in his native fatherland, and came out to Vic- 
toria in 1865. when his father was in this city. He took and worked a claim 
in the Gassier mining district, and although that enterprise did not prove a 
large success he continued his mining operations until he had enough money 
to start his present lousiness. He has been in the coffee and spice business 
longer than any other merchant in Victoria, and he has deservedly won the 
confidence of the public. He has made frequent exhibits of his goods at the 
agricultural expositions, from which he has received several diplomas. He 



644 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

has given his undivided attention to the business, and it is due entirely to his 
own efforts and abiHty that the Pioneer Mills have gained such a high repu- 
tation in this province and elsewhere. 

Mr. Stemler was happily married in 1884 to Miss Ann Smethurst, who 
was born in Victoria. They have two daughters and a son, all born in Vic- 
toria' and all assisting in the business. The names of these capable young 
assistants are Maud, Frederick and Hilder. Mr. Stemler was reared in the 
Lutheran faith, but he and his wife attend the services of the Church of 
England. 

JOSEPH REICHENBACH. 

Joseph Reichenbach, a prominent and well known citizen of New West- 
minster, is president of the Reichenbach Company, Limited, one of the fore- 
most retail meat companies in the northwest. Their market is without doubt 
one of the most up-to-date and complete in America, being equipped with a 
cold storage plant and all means for proper handling and preservation of 
meats. The Reichenbach Company supplies an immense trade throughout 
this part of the province, including numerous mining camps, canneries and 
mills, besides the large local demand. The generous prosperity which has 
come to this business is due to the energy and sagacity of its president, and 
among the young business men of New Westminster none could be selected 
more worthy of esteem than Mr. Reichenbach. 

He was born at Elora, Ontario, in 1867, a son of Joseph and Caroline 
(DeiTer) Reichenbach, who were both early settlers of that part of the prov- 
ince. His father for many years followed the business of butcher in Walker- 
ton, Ontario, and still makes that town his home. 

Mr. Reichenbach received his early education in the public schools of 
Walkerton, but left school at the age of thirteen and began working for his 
father. During the remaining years of youth he learned the butcher business 
in all thoroughness and detail, and that training formed the excellent basis on 
which he has built his success. In 1886 he came to British Columbia and 
established a market in New Westminster, that being the beginning and the 
nucleus of his present establishment. He was burned out in the great fire 
of 1898, but his enterprising ability was manifested by the opening of a place 
for business on the morning following the fire, so that his fellow citizens 
did not suffer for lack of meat. Since that time his business has been 
rapidly expanding, and in February, 1903, he incorporated, with a capital 
stock of twenty-five thousand dollars, the Reichenbach Company, Limited, of 
which he is president.

Although thus closely identified with private business affairs, Mr. Reich- 
enbach is none the less a most public-spirited citizen. He is an active member 
of the New Westminster board of trade. In 1902 he was appointed and has 
since held the position of harbor master of the port of New Westminster. In 
politics he supports the principles and men of the dominant Liberal party. He 
has fraternal association with the Odd Fellows and the Fraternal Order of 
Eagles. 

In 1890 Mr. Reichenbach married Miss Ellen L. Fader. She was born 
in Halifax, Nova Scotia, a daughter of Charles Fader. The five children of 
this marriage are Mabel, Dorothy, Walter, Olive and Lucie Elaine. 

ANDREW E. LEES. 

Progress might well be termed the keynote of the character of Andrew 
E. Lees. It is a noticeable element in his business career, in his citizenship 
and in his social relations and it has been an essential element in making him 
one of the valued residents of Vancouver, He has taken an active interest in 
community affairs and as the champion of many progressive measures has 
contributed to the upbuilding and improvement of the city. 

For a quarter of a century he has been a resident of British Columbia, 
keeping in touch with its growth, which has been so rapid as to partake of 
the nature of the magical. He was born in Perth, Ontario, on the 7th of De- 
cember, 1855, and is of Scotch and English lineage. The founder of the 
family in America was William Lees, a native of Scotland, who crossed 
the Atlantic to Canada and settled upon a tract of land which he developed 
into a highly improved farm. Upon that place William Lees, father of An- 
drew Lees, v\'as born and reared. He too became a farmer, but did not 
confine his attention entirely to agricultural pursuits, for he became the 
owner of a flouring mill and was also interested in the lumber industry. He 
and his wife held membership in the Presbyterian church and so lived as to 
exemplify in their lives its teachings. Four of their family have chosen 
British Columbia as a place of residence: James W., Guy, George Albert 
and Andrew. Albert is in partnership with Andrew E. Lees. 

In the common schools at Fallbrook, Ontario, Andrew E. Lees acquired 
his literary education, and later he attended the Bellville Commercial College. 
He came to British Columbia in 1880 and was at first identified with its 
business interests as an employe in the Royal City Mills, at Westminster. 
Subsequently he worked at sawmilling in Nanaimo, after which, with capital 
acquired through his own labors, he purchased an interest in the Royal City 
Mills, which he conducted for five years, meeting with satisfactory success. 



G4-t) BRITISH COLUMBIA 

He came to Vancouver in 1889 and was actively engaged in the .eal estate 
l:usiness for a year as a member of the firm of Lees &amp; Dowson. He then 
purchased an interest in tlie clothing business of D. J. McLean, and the firm 
did business for three years, at the end of which time Mr. Lees purchased Mr. 
McLean's interest and conducted the business alone and with desirable success 
until 1899, when he admitted his brother George to a partnership and the 
fii"m has since lieen A. E. Lees &amp; Company. They deal in clothing and men's 
furnishing goods and now have a large patronage. Mr. Lees' honorable 
methods in business have made this one of the popular mercantile enterprises 
in this city of many fine stores, and the excellent line of goods which he 
carries, combined with honorable methods, insures a continuance of a re- 
munerative public support. 

In community affairs Mr. Lees has been an active factor and his interest 
in the welfare of the city has found tangible evidence in his labors for the 
general good and substantial improvement of Vancouver. In 1901 he was 
elected by his fellow citizens to the important office of park commissioner 
and the work of improving and beautifying the park receives his very able 
attention. The zoo has been started, much of the park has been adorned by 
the art of the landscape gardener and a very attractive drive has been built 
around the park, nine miles in length. 

In 1887 Mr. Lees was happily married to Miss Anna Elizabeth Play- 
fair, a distant relative on the maternal side of the family and of English 
ancestry. They have five children, all born in British Columbia. Their 
names are William Frederick, Mary Elizabeth, Jessie, Laura and Eugene 
Arnold. Tliey have a delightful home in Vancouver. Mr. and Mrs. Lees 
are members of the Methodist church and he belongs to Mount Hermon Lodge 
No. 7, A.. F. &amp; A. M., of Vancouver. He is a past master of His lodge, 
has been its treasurer for the past seven years, and also belongs to the Ancient 
Order of United Workmen. His life has been characterized by the enter- 
prise which has been the dominant spirit in the upbuilding of the province, 
and his marked individuality, manly purposes and unfaltering determination 
have been the foundation upon which he has builded a success that is as cred- 
itable as it is desirable. 

SIDNEY J. PITTS. 

S. J. Pitts was born in London, England, March 14, 1850, and received 
his education at the College de France in that city. His father, John Henr}^ 
Pitts, was born at Tynmouth, Devon, being one of the well known county 
families of that name, and was established in the city of London for sixteen 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 647 

years as an East India merchant, with a branch house at Calcutta. Shortly 
after the excitement occasioned by the news of the discovery of gold in Brit- 
ish Columbia and California, the family moved to Victoria, where S. J. Pitts, 
after completing his education at the collegiate school in this city, entered the 
law office of Mr. John Copeland, continuing his legal studies till Mr. Cope- 
land left the province. He then changed his career by entering into com- 
mercial life as a wholesale commission merchant, meeting with such marked 
success through his untiring energy and skilful management that his busi- 
ness grew to be one of the largest wholesale importing houses in the province. 
Mr. Pitts, always having the greatest confidence in the future of British 
Columbia, invested largely in real estate, as also in the erection of several 
business blocks in this city, and has taken a deep and helpful interest in the 
welfare and progress of Victoria, and everything contributing to its growth 
and prosperity. He has been particularly interested in promoting commer- 
cial activity whereon the substantial improvement and progress of any com- 
munity so largely depends. The appreciation of his efforts in this direction 
has been plainly indicated by his being elected president of the wholesale 
merchants' exchange, and also in his having been elected to his present posi- 
tion of president of the Victoria Board of Trade, in which institution he has 
long been an active member. 

THOMAS WILSON PATERSON. 

Thomas Wilson Paterson, a representative citizen of Victoria, is identi- 
fied with many of the business and public interests of this province and since 
taking up his residence here has turned his energy in channels of activity 
of much permanent value to the city and country. 

. He is a native of Scotland and in his active life has displayed many 
of the worthy characteristics of the race. He was born near Kilmarnock, 
Ayrshire, December 6, 185 1, and his ancestry is traced back in that country 
for a number of generations. His father, William Paterson, was born and 
reared and educated in Scotland. He married Miss Margaret Piersons, a 
native of the same country, and in 1855 they emigrated to Canada. . The 
father followed farming as his life work, and was held in high esteem in 
his home locality. He was a councillor of his township, and was also one 
of the pillars of the Presbyterian church. He was eighty-five years old 
when called away from life in 1899, and his good wife, who survived him 
until 1901, attained the age of seventy-nine years. They were the parents 
of five children, three daughters and two sons, and the daughters reside in 



648 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Ontario. . John A. Paterson is a farmer residing at Ladner, British Co- 
lumbia. 

Mr. Paterson was educated in the public schools of Oxford county, 
Ontario, and for the first fifteen years of his life remained on the farm. 
He then apprenticed to the machinist's trade, and followed public works until 
1885, when he came out to Victoria and became engaged in contracting on 
public works. He built fifty miles of the E. &amp; N. Railroad, and also con- 
structed the Sushwap and Okanogan Railway, and is a stockholder in this 
line. He built the original five miles of the Victoria tramway, and built and 
operated for seven years the Victoria and Sidney Railway. He at present 
is largely interested in milling and in stock and grain farming on his fine 
estate of fourteen hundred acres near Victoria, and is in the lumber business 
in connection with the Canadian Pacific Lumber Company. He and his wife 
have a delightful home in Victoria, and are esteemed members of the society 
of that city and members of the Presbyterian church. Mr. Paterson has 
been active in public affairs, and as a Liberal in politics served in the pro- 
vincial legislature, and during his term was a member of the committees on 
railways, mines and public accounts. 

Mr. Paterson was happily married in 1886 to Miss Emma Riley, a 
native of St. Catherine, Ontario. Her father, George Riley, is a member of 
the legislature from Victoria. 

HENRY SCHAAKE. 

Henry Schaake, of New Westminster, is the proprietor of one of the most 
important industrial enterprises of the city and province. Like all important 
undertakings of this character, it was on a small scale that the beginnings were 
made of the Schaake machine shops and foundry, where are manufactured all 
kinds of shop machinery, canning and can-making machinery, etc. It is one 
of the most complete establishments of the kind in British Columbia, and its 
success is evidence of the masterful ability with which Mr. Schaake has 
prosecuted the enterprise from the first. 

Mr. Schaake is still young in years, but has been connected with me- 
chanical pursuits either as a workman, originator or individual proprietor since 
he was a boy. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1867, a son of Henry and 
Caroline (Fieseler) Schaake, natives of Germany, who emigrated to this coun- 
try in their young days, and his father a prosperous shoe manufacturer of 
Baltimore, Mr. Henry Schaake was educated in the public schools of Balti- 
more and when a boy began learning the trade of a machinist in that city. 
Of an active, originating mind he succeeded in inventing, in 1884, automatic 



(1 ,v 

, (I 'i 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 649 

can-making machinery, besides following his general trade. He went west 
to San Francisco in 1887, and there formed the Eagle Automatic Can Com- 
pany, with which he was connected as superintendent until he came to British 
Columbia in 1896. His can-making invention had revolutionized that branch 
of mechanical industry and he has ever since made the manufacture of this 
machinery or its operation a part of his occupation. On coming to British 
Columbia he built the Automatic Can Company's plant, equipping it with his 
own patented machinery, and he remained the manager of this concern until 
the disastrous fire of 1898. After that he established a plant of his own for 
the manufacture of canning and can-making machines and also a general 
foundry and machine works. Only five men were employed at the start, but 
the force has since been augmented to sixty and the entire industry has ex- 
panded proportionately. For the past few years attention has also been given 
to tlie manufacture of shingle and sawmill machinery. The firm operates its 
own machine shop, pattern, blacksmith, foundry and draughting departments, 
so that it is one of the most complete plants of the kind in the northwest. 
Further additions and improvements are constantly in progress and the con- 
tinued growth and prosperity of the concern are practical certainties. Owing 
to the increased demand for shingle and sawmill machinery in the past few 
years they have equipped their plant with a complete and modern line of tools 
especially adapted for the manufacture of general mill machinery. Theii 
patterns and designs for that class of work cover the latest ideas for the manu- 
facture of lumber and shingles, they having in connection with their plant 
a corps of the most expert workmen and who have made a specialty of adopt- 
ing new designs and improved methods for the manufacture of this particular 
line of machinery, this being the only plant in British Columbia who carry a 
complete line of patterns and designs suitable for the installment of mill ma- 
chinery of any capacity. In 1904 Mr. Schaake established a branch for the 
manufacture of the same line of machinery in Seattle, Washington, and an 
agency has been placed in San Francisco, where is carried a line of his canning 
and can-making machinery. 

Mr. Schaake is a member of the New Westminster Board of Trade and 
is always interested in matters pertaining to the welfare of the citv. Frater- 
nally he is a member of the Masonic order. In 1887 he was married to Miss 
Kate Rider, a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and a daughter of Anton Rider, 
an old and prominent citizen of that place. Mr. and Mrs. Schaake are the 
parents of three children, Carrie, Irene and Howard.

CHARLES A. VERNON. 



Charles A. Vernon is a British Columbia pioneer of 1863 and now 
a prominent and well known resident of Victoria. He has been an active 
factor in the industrial and manufacturing, enterprises of the province, and 
has shown large capacity for directing interests of great magnitude, and 
his public-spirited citizenship has always been in evidence throughout his 
career in the province. 

Born in Bedfordshire, England, January 17, 1840, a son of J. E. 
Venables Vernon, of Clontarf Castle, Ireland, he is a descendant of Norman 
ancestry, the earliest Vernon, taking his name from the town of that name 
in Normandy, being a companion in arms with William the Conqueror, 
and entering England at the time of the conquest. One branch of the family 
remained resident in England, and the branch from which Mr. Vernon is 
descended went to Ireland and settled near Dublin, where the generations 
have remained to the present time, and several fine estates in that vicinity 
have been in the family name for centuries. 

Mr. Vernon was educated in R. M. C. Sandust, being trained for mili- 
tary life, and for some time, held a commission as lieutenant in the Twentieth 
Regiment Lancaster Fusileers. In June, 1863, ^^ ^^^ his brother, the 
Hon. Forbes G. Vernon, former chief commissioner of lands and works in 
British Columbia, sailed from Liverpool for New York, thence by the Panama 
route arrived at San Francisco and then at Esquimault, from which point 
they went to^ the Okanogan country and established there a large cattle 
ranch. They were the first settlers in their locality, for some time having 
the only settlement within a radius of one hundred miles. That is a rich 
country, and on the fifteen thousand acres of land which they secured they 
raised immense herds of cattle and horses and carried on the enterprise with 
marked success in all dq^artments, until they disposed of their holding to 
the Earl of Aberdeen. They were also engaged in merchandising and min- 
ing, and their enterprises formed the nucleus around which the town of 
Vernon was built up, the name of the brothers being given to that, the oldest 
town in that section of the province. After spending a number of years in 
that business and in that locality, Mr. Vernon came to Victoria, where he 
has since had his home and chief business interests. He has a handsome 
residence, attractive and noteworthy in a city of fine homes. He is one of 
the owners of the British Columbia Pottery Company, manufacturers of 
tile and all kinds of pottery, their works being located on the E. &amp; N. Rail- 
road at Russell. Mr. Vernon is rated as one of the most substantial and 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 651 

enterprising business men of the province, and as a pioneer resident he takes 
additional interest in the growth and prosperity of British Columbia and has 
in many ways shown his eminent public spirit in many matters affecting the 
city's welfare. 

Mr. Vernon was married in 1879, in New York, to Miss McTavish 
a native of Argyleshire, Scotland. Their eldest child, Albert Archibald, 
served in the South African war in the Strathcone Horse and is now a lieu- 
tenant in the Fifth Contingent Regiment. He is six feet three inches tall, 
and every inch a soldier and vigorous young man, and has given a very 
creditable account of himself as one of British Columbia's native sons. He 
is at present engaged in railway surveying. The second son, Charles Henry, 
is now in the Bank of Commerce, and the daughter, Voilet Mary, is now the 
wife of Captain Blandy, R. E. The family are adherents of the Episco- 
palian faith. Mr. Vernon's disposition to retirement and management of 
his private affairs has never allowed him to engage in public life, and he 
has accordingly never sought or desired ofifice. However, he served for a 
number of years as gold commissioner and land commissioner for the prov- 
ince and has also been appointed to the office of justice of the peace. 

HENRY CARLYON EDWARDS. 

Henry Carlyon Edwards is a successful retail grocer in Victoria and 
also well known throughout the province through his connection with the 
great fraternal order of the A. O. U. W. He is now grand master workman 
of the grand lodge of this order in British Columbia, and his career in the 
order has been one of unusual honor and marked by faithful and effective 
efforts towards the upbuilding' and strengthening of the society. 

Mr. Edwards has lived in Victoria since he was ten years old, and, 
being educated and reared in this city, has throughout his active life been 
interested in its welfare and his own enterprises have added permanency 
to the city's resources. His business course shows his persistency in follow- 
ing out one line of work and in devoting his energies to that line until he 
arrived at a high degree of individual success. Mr. Edwards was born in 
England, January 2, iS/O, and is of good English ancestry. His father, 
Richard Edwards, was born, reared and educated in that country, and was 
married there to Miss Mary Jane Carlyon. Six children were born to 
them in England, and in 1881 the entire family emigrated to British Colum- 
bia, where the father has since followed merchandising in the main. He and 
his wife are Methodists, and they now reside on Salt Spring island. 
■ Mr. Edwards completed his early education in Victoria, and when but 



662 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

a boy began learning the plasterer's trade, which he followed until he was 
nineteen years old. He then accepted a clerkship in the store of which he 
is now the proprietor, which position has been won by his own labor and 
business industry. He filled the place of clerk altogether for eleven years, 
and during this time a change of ownership in the store was made, but with- 
out affecting his relationship as an employe. In December, 1903, he pur- 
chased this establishment and has since conducted it as a high-grade retail 
grocery. He put in an entirely new stock of family groceries, and he enjoys 
a large and profitable trade. 

November 28, 1890, Mr. Edwards married Miss Ellen Frances Sarge- 
son. They have four children, all of whom were born in Victoria, namely: 
William Francis, Henry Grant, Richard C. and Gerald. They reside in 
one of Victoria's nice homes, and are held in the highest regard in the social 
circles of the city. 

Mr. Edwards is a member of the Masonic fraternity, holding the office 
of steward in his lodge. In 1893 he united with the Ancient Order of 
United Workmen, and he has since filled all the offices of both the subordi- 
nate and the grand lodges. He is now serving his second term as grand 
master workman of the grand lodge of the province. He is also a member 
of the Degree of Honor. His further fraternal affiliations are with the 
Knights of Pythias and the Woodmen of the World, and he is a past coun- 
cillor in. the latter order. 

JOSHUA KINGHAM. 

Joshua Kingham is prominent in Victoria business circles as a coal 
dealer and representative of several fire insurance companies, and has also 
manifested a deep interest in the public welfare of the city. He has the 
reputation of being a straightforward, progressive and enterprising man of 
affairs, and has won and retained the high esteem of all his fellow citizens. 

Mr. Kingham is a native Englishman and comes of an old and honor- 
able English family. He was born February 22, 1866, in Buckingham- 
shire, and was educated in Bedfordshire. He began business life as an ac- 
countant with the firm of T. Lye &amp; Sons, and continued in that line for 
several years. His brother, the Rev. Henry Kingham, had in the mean- 
while come out to Victoria and become assistant rector of the Episcopal 
church. Impressed by the reports sent back by his brother concerning the 
natural opportunities and resoinxes of this province, Mr. Kingham was not 
long in making up his mind to try this new world field. He came to Vic- 
toria in 1890, and for a time followed his business as accountant and also 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 653 

Avas in the jewelry trade. In 1897 he accepted the agency of the Nanaimo 
colheries, and has since sold a large amount of coal in Victoria. He is 
the sole agent for these well known coal mines, and he has built up the 
trade to large and profitable proportions. In addition he has the agency of 
the New York Underwriters and of several other prominent companies, and 
each year writes a number of policies in the city. His attention is also 
devoted to the business of a large forwarding firm, whose representative he 
is in this city, and in this capacity he attends to the shipping of a large 
amount of goods. 

Mr. Kingham was married in 1897 to Miss Grace Helen Fawcet, who 
is a native daughter of Victoria and her father is Mr. Rowland Fawcet of 
this city. They have three children, all of whom were born in Victoria : 
Dorothy Grace, Rowland Joshua and Agnes Constance. The family are 
Episcopalians, attending the Reformed Episcopal church, in which Mr. King- 
ham is a committeeman. He fraternizes with the Knights of Pythias, and 
takes an active part in the social and club life of the city. He is president 
of the Pacific Club, and also president of the Victoria Liberal Association. 
As a member of the council of the board of trade he finds oppotrtunity to 
exert his efforts and influence for the welfare of the city, and never fails to 
do his ]3art in this laudable work. 

LUDWIG E. ERB. 

Ludwig E. Erb, the founder and for so many years the active pro- 
prietor of the Victoria Brewing Company, died at his home in Victoria in 
1897. He was a pioneer citizen of the province, one of the ablest factors 
in the upbuilding of his city, and an influential member of society. 

Mr. Erb was born in Cassel, Germany, in 1836. He was reared in his 
native country, and after the education of the schools passed to a practical 
training for the affairs of life as an apprentice to the brewer's trade. He 
came to America at the age of twenty-one, and after passing a few years in 
New York and San Francisco came up to British Columbia and had an 
experience in the mining district of the Cariboo, when the gold excitement 
there was at its height. In 1870 he established the brewing business in Vic- 
toria which has so long been conducted under the name of the Victoria 
Brewing Company, and he was the active manager of this concern until his 
death, at which time his son Emil A. took charge and still manages the 
same. Mr. Erb was a member of the Pioneer Society of British Columbia, 
and v^'as affiliated with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and in 
various other ways was closely identified with the affairs of his home city. 



654 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

The Erb home is one of the prettiest in Victoria, and the family have a high 
standing, whe-itver known. 

]\''r. Erb was married in 1872 to Miss Augusta Jungermann, who w^as 
born 111 Albany, New York, a daughter of Juhus L. Jungermann and Barbara 
Slichel, both of German stock. There are four children in the Erb family: 
Augusta, w'xit of J. E. Wilson; Matilda, wife of Biggerstaff Wilson; and 
Emil A. and Herman. 

THOMAS JOSEPH ARMSTRONG. 

Thomas Joseph Armstrong, one of the enterprising native sons of British 
Columbia, is sheriff of the county of Westminster and in many ways prom- 
inently identified with the affairs of New Westminster, city and district. He 
is a member of the well known Armstrong family, which has furnished pio- 
neers and some of the ablest men of affairs that have participated in the growth 
and development of this section of the province. 

Mr. Armstrong was born in New Westminster in 1864, being a son of 
William James and Honor C. (Ladner) Armstrong. His father is now re- 
tired from his former activity in business and public affairs, being one of the 
honored residents of New Westminster, and his biography is given on other 
pages of this work. 

The common and high schools of New Westminster gave Mr. Armstrong 
his early educational opportunities. His school days continued until he was 
eighteen years old, at which age he became a clerk in a book and stationery 
store. He later went to California and learned the drug business in San Fran- 
cisco. On returning to British Columbia in 1885 he engaged in the drug 
trade in partnership with F. H. Coulter at New Westminster, but in the fol- 
lowing year disposed of his interests to D. S. Curtis, who is still numbered 
among the leading drug men of the city. In May, 1886, began Mr. Arm- 
strong's career in public office, at which time he became deputy for his father, 
who was then sheriff. He continued the deputyship until September 17, 1892, 
and on that date was appointed acting sheriff of the county of Westminster. 
On the coming into force of the act dividing the counties of Westminster and 
Vancouver, on October 27, 1892, he received the appointment of acting sheriff 
for the latter county also, and held the conjoint positions until July 25, 1893, 
on which date he was appointed sheriff for county Westminster, and has filled 
that office ever since. In August, 1901, he was appointed issuer of marriage 
licenses. 

Mr. Armstrong is prominent in Masonic circles, was deputy grand master

master of the grand lodge of British Columbia in the session held in New- 
Westminster. He is an active member of the Westminster Club. In 1888 
he was married to Miss Annie Kerr. She was born in Ingersoll, Ontario, 
and was a daughter of Daniel Kerr, a pioneer carriage manufacturer of that 
place. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong have one daughter, Nora Marguerite. 
Theirs is one of the most attractive homes in New Westminster, beautiful, 
not alone for its exterior and interior comfort, but also for its well known 
warmth of hospitality and geniality. 

ALEXANDER H. B. MACGOWAN. 

Alexander Henry Boswall Macgowan, the senior member of the firm of 
Macgowan &amp; Company, shipping commissioners and insurance agents at 
No. 226 Cambie street, Vancouver, figures prominently in business circles 
of the city, where he has resided continuously since early in 1888. He has 
thus been a witness of the phenomenal growth, and in his private business 
career has kept pace with the progress that has here been made. 

A native of Prince Edward Island, Mr. Macgowan was born on the 
14th of April, 1850, and the Macgpwans are of English, Scotch and Irish 
ancestry. He is descended from Rev. John Macgowan, who was born in 
Scotland, but removed to London, England, and was a Baptist minister, 
devoting" his life for many years to the work of the church. His grave is 
in Bun Hill T'ields, London. His son, Peter Macgowan, grandfather of 
Alexander H. B. Macgowan, was a native of England, but at an early day 
removed to Prince Edw-ard Island, where he became a lawyer of prominence, 
serving as attorney general of Prince Edward Island under royal appoint- 
ment. 

William Stanforth Macgowan, father of our subject, was born on Prince 
Edward Island, and became a successful farmer and merchant. He was 
also influential and active in community affairs, and served for several terms 
as high sheriff of Kmgs county. He married Miss Ann Burston Boswall, 
who was born in the south of England and was a daughter of Dr. A. H. 
Boswall, who was born on shipboard near the Rock of Gibraltar, his father 
having been a naval commander, while his wife, who bore the maiden name 
of O'Connel, was a lady of Irish ancestry. William S. Macgowan attained 
the advanced age of eighty-two years, while his wife departed this life in 
the seventieth year of her age and was buried at Chilliwack, British Colum- 
bia. They were the parents of nine children, only tw^o of whom are now 
living, a daughter, Amelia Macgowan, and the subject of this review. 

: Alexander H. B. Macgowan was educated in Prince Edwards Island in 



656 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the public schools, and throughout his entire life has been engaged in the 
shipping, commission and insurance business. As the senior member of the 
firm of Macgowan &amp; Company in this line he is conducting a successful busi- 
ness at No. 226 Cambie street, Vancouver, being associated with his sons 
Max and Roy, who are young business men of marked ability. The firm 
represents the Consumers Cordage Company, Limited, the Dominion Bay 
Company, Limited, the Firemen's Fund Marine Insurance Company, the Sun 
Fire office, the Fire Insurance Company of North America, also the Bombay 
Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company, Limited, the St. Paul Marines and 
Lloyds Underwriters. The Sun Insurance Company, which the firm repre- 
sents, is the oldest purely fire insurance company in the world, and the Fire 
Insurance Company of North America is the oldest of the kind in the United 
States. His business is one of the most successful in the city in this line, 
and Mr. Macgowan is one of the pioneer representatives of this field of 
business activity, wherein he has so carefully directed his labors that his 
business has increased proportionately with the marvelous growth of Van- 
couver. 

In 1874 Mr. Macgowan was married on Prince Edward's Island to Miss 
Frances M. Hayden, a native of his own town and a daughter of Alexander 
Hayden, who was for many years a successful ship builder there and also 
a justice of the peace. This union has been blessed with five sons, of whom 
four are living, namely: Max and Roy, their father's partners; Lyle, an 
accountant; and Erl, who, like his brother, is holding a responsible position 
as an accountant. 

For many years Mr. Macgowan has been a very active member of the 
Masonic fraternity, having become identified with the craft in 1874. He is 
a past' master of twenty years' standing, and had the honor of being deputy 
grand master of Prince Edward Island the year he left there. He now 
affiliates with Cascade Ix)dge of Vancouver. In politics he is a Conservative, 
and he has always taken an active jnterest in community affairs, especially 
in promoting the prosperity of Vancouver and advancing its material im- 
provement. He was the first secretary of the Vancouver Board of Trade, 
and filled that office for five years. He was also the first secretary of the Fruit 
Growers' Association and of the British Columbia Dairymen's Association, 
and has thus latered to promote various interests which have had direct 
bearing upon the general prosperity and commercial activity of the province, 
tie served for eight years on the school board of Vancouver, as secretary. 
chairman, etc., and labored assiduously for the establishment of the present 
splendid school system here. He was elected to the provincial parliament- in 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 657 

1903, and is a supporter of the McBricle Conservative government. He 
and his family have a pleasant home at No. 1121 Georgia avenue and occupy 
an enviable position in social circles. 

ROBERT CLARK. 

Robert Clark, who is one of Vancouver's representative business men, 
was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland, September 17, 1845, a son of James 
and Anna R. (McGeoch) Clark. The ancestry of the family can be traced 
back to the fifteenth century and representatives of the name followed agri- 
cultural and mechanical pursuits. Through many generations they were 
Presbyterians in religions faith. The father of our subject died in the six- 
tieth year of his age, while the mother attained the advanced age of eighty- 
one years. They had four children, three sons and a daughter, Robert 
and Joseph being the only members of the family in British Columbia. 

Robert Clark was educated in the villages of Bowling and Kilpatrick. 
His early connection with business life began in a grocery store, where he 
was employed for a time. Later he learned the ship-builder's trade and on 
the I St of May, 1871, when about twenty-five years of age, he left his native 
country, taking passage at Glasgow for Quebec. From the latter city he 
made his way to Toronto, where he remained for three months, after which 
he entered the services of Captain Dick and went to Fort Francis, where 
he worked during the year 187 1. Subsequently he went down river and 
made his way across the Lake of the Woods on foot. The party with which 
he traveled had to get a few muskrats in order to keep from starving, for 
they thought that they could not hold out until they could reach a place 
where provisions could be o1)tained. Finally, however, they arrived at North- 
west Angle, Lake of the Woods, and were there given something to eat, 
so that they did not have to eat the muskrats. Arriving there on the 8th of 
May, they stopped for the night and secured a large kettle of bean soup, 
Mr. Clark eating three bowls of it. Refreshed by their meal and their night's 
rest the party started the next morning to walk sixteen miles. Mr. Clark 
thus far had traveled in moccasins, but they had become worn out and he 
had to put on a pair of high-heeled boots, which were not easy to wailk in, 
for the country had been flooded with rain and the ground was inundated 
with water and slush. For a long distance the party had to wade and the 
boots rubbing Mr. Clark's heels took all the skin off. The next morning, 
because of his sore heels, he was unable to keep up with the party and was 
obliged to take off his boots and socks and walked for sixty miles in bare feet 
through snow and brush. At length they reached Point Lachine, where they 



658 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

again stopped for the night, lying on the floor wrapped in their blankets. 
From that place they walked thirty-six miles to Winnipeg. The river was 
unnble to carry off the water from the melting snow and they waded through 
ten miles of water ice cold and from six to eighteen inches deep. As they 
drew near Winnipeg it began to grow dark. Mr. Clark's heels were badly 
cut and his ankles were swollen and he and another of the party were unable 
to keep up with the majority of their comrades. Tired out, he threw his 
pack in a dry place and said he could go no farther. Others of the party, 
however, returned to him and after resting for a time he made another effort 
to proceed. The road became easier to travel as they neared the town and 
when he caught sight of the river and saw the lights of the little town 
of Winnipeg beyond he was filled with great thankfulness. They 
reached their destination at nine o'clock at night and again the party slept 
on their blankets. For two or three weeks after this Mr. Clark was very 
lame, but as soon as possible he began active work. He built the first steamer 
that sailed on Lake Manitoba. Going into the forest he picked out the 
trees, hewed the timber and with help whip-sawed the lumber. He then 
built and launched the boat and delivered her to the owners, a craft one 
hundred feet in length. The woods were infested with mosquitoes so nu- 
merous that they occasioned great trouble to the men. Their supply of pro- 
visions also iDecame exhausted and Mr. Clark found it difficult to retain his 
helpers until the work was completed. They made a boat to cross the lake 
two hundred miles for provisions, but the day they intended to make the 
start help came to them, bringing them needed supplies. They had made 
sails out of their blankets and thus ■ they sailed the boat across the lake. 
When this task was accomplished Mr. Clark worked for the Hudson's Bay 
Company for two or three years, at the end of which time he returned to 
Grand Forks, afterward went to Morehead and to Duluth, Minnesota, on to 
St. Paul, Omaha, to Sacramento and later to San Francisco, and he remained 
in San Francisco for three months and arrived in Victoria, British Colum- 
bia, in 1875. 

Mr. Clark has long figured' prominently in commercial circles in this 
province. In 1880 he opened a men's furnishing goods store in Nanaimo, 
carrying all kinds of supplies and conducting the enterprise for a year. He 
then removed to Yale with his stock and after carrying on business there 
for a year his store was destroyed by fire and he met with severe loss. He 
remained at Yale until the spring of 1886, when owing to the building of 
the Canadian Facific Railroad he returned to Vancouver. He then opened 
his store on the same street on which he is now located, and he has a large 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 659 

and successful business. He built his present store, ninety by one hundred 
and thirty-two feet, and in it he carries a full and complete line of men's 
furnishing goods, carefully selected. He is the pioneer clothing merchant . 
of this place and has met with gratifying success not only in his mercantile 
efforts, but also through his investment in city property, which, owing to the 
rapid growth of the town, has increased greatly in its valuation. He is 
now one of the most prosperous citizens of Vancouver and well does he merit 
the success that has come to him, for in early years he suffered many hard- 
ships and difficulties in his attempt to gain a good start in business and by 
his perseverance and energy he has overcome the difficulties in his path. 

In 1890 Mr. Clark was married to Miss Frances Gilmore and they have 
two sons, Robert James and Cuthbert Norm.an, both born in Vancouver. 
The parents are Presbyterians in religious faith and Mr. Clark assisted in 
building the First Presbyterian church in this city. He has always been 
deeply interested in the moral and intellectual development of Vancouver 
and has also contributed to its substantial upbuilding. He was one of the 
originators of the movement to open the Vancouver city wharf and he has 
made a good record as a citizen and business man. In the years 1887, 1888 
and 1889 li^ served as a member of the city council, being elected without 
asking any man for his vote, and he stood at the head of the poll. He is « 
member of the Caledonia Society, was the second president and is also a 
member of the Sons of Scotland, of which he was the first chief. He is still 
an active and valued representative of these orders and he belongs to the 
Knights of Pythias fraternity, in which he has passed all the chairs and has 
been grand keeper of the record and seals for two terms. His has been 
an eventful career in that he has been closely associated with the pioneer 
development of the northwest and what he has accomplished should serve to 
inspire and encourage others who in business life have had to start out with- 
out capital, as he did. 

COLONEL FALKLAND GEORGE EDGEWORTH WARREN, 

R. A., C. M. G. 

Colonel Falkland G. E. Warren, C. M. G., late Royal Artillery, was 
born in Dublin, Ireland, on the i6th of June, 1834. His father. Lieutenant 
Dawson Warren, Royal Artillery, was the sixth in descent from Sir Edmund 
Verney of Penley, Bucks, England, who was sheriff of Bucks in 1582, one of 
the' five captains appointed to command "The Masters of the County" at 
the time of the Spanish Armada, and whose son Sir Edmund Verney, of 
Middle Claydon (of Bucks), was slain at the battle of Edgehill on the 23d 



060 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of October. 1642. while l^aring, as knight marshal, the Royal Standard of 
King- Charles I. 

Lieutenant Dawson Warren left two other sons, the eldest of whom, 
General Dawson Warren, C. B., is still living. The second son, William, of 
the Twentieth Regiment Bombay Infantry, was killed at the storming of 
Reshire in Persia in 1856 in the twenty-fourth year of his age. 

Colonel Falkland Warren was educated at the Royal Military Academy, 
Woolwich, and obtained his commission in the Royal Artillery in 1852. 
His first foreign service was at Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1853-54. On pro- 
motion to first lieutenancy he proceeded to England, and in 1857 went to 
Hong Kong on the outbreak of war with China. The troops sent upon this 
expedition were directed to India to assist in the suppression of the great 
Indian mutiny. The artillery, to which Lieutenant Warren belonged, reached 
Calcutta in September, 1857, and were at once dispatched ta the front. 
Colonel Warren's services during these operations embraced the following 
battles and engagements: The Relief of Lucknow, under General Sir Colin 
Campbell, in November; the battle of Cawnpore, in December, 1857. In 
the expedition under General Sir Hope Grant to Fatteghur and the storm- 
ing of Meagunge, Lieutenant Warren commanded the heavy battery, men- 
tioned in dispatches. "In the space of fifty minutes the two heavy guns 
made a practicable breach. Lieutenant Warren, commanding the heavy 
gims, deserves great praise for the speedy and effective manner the wall was 
breached." (London Gazette, 25 May, 1858.) The siege and capture of 
Lucknow, mentioned in dispatches of Brigadier-General George Barker, com- 
manding Royal Artillery : "Lieutenant Warren with a detachment of the 
Royal Artillery accompanied the infantry into the Kaiser Bagh and turned 
two of the enemy's gims upon them with good effect." Also mentioned in 
dispatches of H. E. the Commander-in-Chief, London Gazette, 28th of May, 
1858. Served in the subsequent operations of the capture of the Morsa Bagh 
and Moulvie's Mosque under Sir James Outram.

Grant, including the action of Bari, the destruction of the fortress of Doondia- 
Kerch, the action at Simri, the occupation of Fyzabad and the passage of 
the Goomtee at Sultanpore, mentioned in dispatches, London Gazette, 31st 
of January, 1859. He served through the campaigns in Onde in 1859, the 
capture of the fortresses of Amethie and Shunkerpore, the taking of 'the 
forts Rehora and Koelee. Next served in the Trans-Gogra campaign, includ- 
ing the affair of Cherorda, and capture of Fort Mudjidia; at the latter place 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 661 

commanded the mortar battery. For these services he received the Indian 
mutiny medal and two clasps. 

Lieutenant Warren was promoted to a captaincy in 1859 and shortly 
after appointed deputy assistant quartermaster general to the Royal Artil- 
lery in Bengal, which appointment he held until it was abolished in 1862. 
In that year he took part in the operations against the frontier tribes of 
the northwest of India, in 1862-63 at the Umbeyla Pass, including the storm- 
ing of the Conical Hill, the capture of Lalloo and battle on the plains of 
ChimJa. (Mentioned in dispatches of Brigadier-General Sir W. Turner.) 
For this campaign he received the Indian frontier war medal and one clasp. 

Captain Warren's next war services were in the Bhootan war of 1864-65, 
when he was present at the occupation of Bissen Sing, the forcing of the 
Bala Pass, the capture of the stockades at Tassagong, and forcing of the 
Pass at Buxar. For this campaign he received a clasp to the Indian frontier 
war medal; and was invalided to England. Captain Warren was appointed 
to the Royal Horse Artillery in 1867; promoted to first captain in 1869, to 
major in 1872; appointed to the Royal Horse Artillery ("B" battery) in 
1873; promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1877. 

In 1878 Colonel Falkland Warren took service under the foreign office, as 
the effect of an army warrant would remove him from full pay in the army 
at the expiration of a few years. His civil service began as assistant com- 
missioner of Lamica, Cyprus; he was shortly advanced to commissioner 
of Limasol, and in 1879 was appointed by the Queen chief secretary to the 
government of Cyprus, which position he held until his retirement in 1890. 
His civil service was declared by the secretary of state for war to count as 
regimental employment towards pay and military pension. In 1881 he was 
promoted to full colonelcy and made a companion of the Most Distinguished 
Order of St. Michael and St. George. On the i6th of June, 1889, he was 
placed on retired military pay, having completed his fifty-fifth year of age.

1897 he moved to and built his present residence at 911 Nicola street, Van- 
couver. 

ALEXANDER EWEN. 

Alexander Eavcu, known throughout British Columbia as one of the 
foremost salmon packers of the province, has the distinction of being the pio- 
neer in the salmon fishing industry in British Columbia, having been actively 
concerned in this line of industry for over forty years. He has been a leading 
factor in the development of the salmon business to its present mammoth pro- 
portions in the northwest, and after carrying it on for years as an active pro- 
prietor has recently entered into the consolidation of these interests in the 
Fraser river valley, being now president of the British Columbia Packers As- 
sociation. 

Mr. Ewen's career is a record of " early and late " diligence, persevering 
application to his chosen line of work, and able business management as his 
interests have expanded and his success increased. Born in Aberdeen, Scot- 
land, in 1832, he was a son of George and Elizabeth (Shepherd) Ewen, both 
natives of Scotland. His father was a lifelong fisherman, being among the 
first to use the trap system in Scotland. After a brief and intermittent educa- 
tion in the common schools of Aberdeen, Alexander went into the business 
followed by his father, having got his first experience in the work when he 
was but seven years old. The first thirty years of his life were spent in Scot- 
land as an active fisherman, and in 1863 he emigrated to British Columbia and 
located at New Westminster at a time when the surrounding country was very 
wild and with little progress made in industry or civic development. He at 
once continued his work of fishing, in those first years finding a market for 






— -^, 




UCuAyL lAATCAyxy 



(I .VI I', u 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 663 

his catch in the Sandwich Islands and Austrah'a, and later in Great Britain. 
Shipping facilities were then limited, and home trade was scarcely developed 
at all. 

Mr. Ewen first began packing salmon in 1870, and from a very small 
enterprise in that year he continued to expand it from year to year to a concern 
of large and profitable extent. The output from his establishment in 1870 
was about three hundred cases, while in 1902 — the year in which he disposed 
of his interests to the Association — he was packing annually from fifteen to 
forty-five thousand cases. At the same time he was interested in two other 
canneries, the combined output of which went as high as one hundred thousand 
cases per season. In 1902 occurred the general consolidation of the different 
canning companies operating on the Fraser river, and he was made president 
of the British Columbia Packers Association and has large stock in the cor- 
poration. Mr. Ewen also has extensive farming interests in the province, 
owning three estates in the Fraser valley, and has considerable mining and 
railroad property. Politically he has supported the Liberal party, but has 
never been attracted by the honors of any public office. 

In 1876 Mr. Ewen married Miss Mary Rogers, a native of Ontario, and 
a daughter of old settlers in the Dominion. Mr. and Mrs. Ewen have three 
children, all daughters : Adelaide, wife of John Jardine, of New Westmin- 
ster; Isabella and Alexandria. Fraternally Mr. Ewen is a member of the 
Independent Order of Odd Fellows. 

JAMES ARCHIBALD McNAIR. 

Honored and respected by all, there is no man who occupies a more 
prominent or enviable position in industrial or financial circles than James 
Archibald McNair, the president and general manager of the Hastings 
Shingle Manufacturing Company, Limited. This splendid enterprise, prov- 
ing of marked value to the city of Vancouver through the promotion of its 
commercial prosperity, is largely a monument to his enterprise, business 
foresight and capacity. His celerity of mental action has always enabled 
him to clearly understand a business situation and recognize a business pos- 
sibility, and his keen discernment and unflagging enterprise have constituted 
salient features in his success. 

Mr. McNair was born in Restigouche county, New Brunswick, on the 
nth of August, 1865. In the maternal as well as the paternal line he comes 
of Scotch ancestry. His father, Nathaniel McNair, was born in Campbell- 
town, Ayrshire, Scotland, and when a young man emigrated to New Bruns- 
wick. He was married there to Miss Martha Archibald, a native of his own 



664 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

country, who went with her parents to New Brunswick when she was but 
four years of age, being there reared and educated. Mr. McNair was a 
farmer and lumberman, carrying on business along both lines. They ad- 
hered to the Presbyterian faith of their ancestors and were people of the 
highest respectability. He died in the sixty-fifth year of his age, while his 
wife survived him and departed this life in her seventy-fourth year. They 
were the parents of ten children, of whom eight are living, while five are 
residents of British Columbia, namely : William, who resides in Okan- 
ogan, Canada, and the others are now in Vancouver and Westminster. 

James Archibald McNair was educated in River Louison, Restigouche, 
New Brunswick, and afterward learned the business of lumber under the 
direction of his father. Subsequently he engaged in business on his own 
account there in connection with his brother, prior to his removal to the 
Pacific coast. He came to Vancouver in 1892, because of the better facili- 
ties for the successful prosecution of the shingle and lumber business. He 
was not disappointed in his hope of securing better opporturities here, and 
is now conducting an extensive enterprise, his product finding a market from 
the Atlantic to the Pacific coast. At this writing he is the president and 
general manager of the Hastings Shingle Manufacturing Company, Limited, 
having a shingle and planing mill in Vancouver and a sawmill at Moody- 
ville, British Columbia, also four shingle mills in the state of Washington. 
•The head ofiice is in Vancouver, and the officers of the company are F. M. 
Britton, secretary and treasurer, and A. C. Flummerfelt, R. J. Kerr, A. B. 
Erskine, R. McNair and J. A. McNair, directors. They manufacture all 
kinds and shapes of cedar shingles, fir and cedar lumber, base, casings, mold- 
ings, newels, banisters and veranda posts, and the daily capacity is twO' mil- 
lion two hundred and fifty thousand shingles, with a dr}^- kiln capacity of 
eighteen million five hundred thousand shingles and one hundred and fifty- 
five thousand feet of lumber. The business was incorporated in 1901 by 
Robert McNair and James Archibald McNair, and they have since associated 
with them S. H. C. Miner, of Granby, Province of Quebec, and A. C. Flum- 
merfelt, of Victoria, the latter being the chairman of the board of directors, 
while Robert McNair is superintendent of the mills. The business had a 
small beginning, the mill being of limited proportions, but gradually its 
capacity has been increased, modern machinery has been added, and in fact 
the enterprise has had a phenomenal growth, far exceeding the highest ex- 
pectations of Mr. McNair, who is now regarded as the shingle king of the 
northwest. This is an industry that has been one of the most important fac- 
tors in promoting the wealth of British Columbia, and those who have de- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 665 

veloped the lumber trade have contributed in large measure to the growth 
and improvement of this portion of the country. In his relations with his 
employes Mr. McNair is always just and considerate, and they recognize 
the fact that good service on their part means promotion as opportunity of- 
fers. In his relations with his patrons he is known to be extremely reliable, 
the place of the house being in conformity with the high standard of com- 
mercial ethics. His success is undoubtedly due in large measure to the fact 
that he has persisted in a line of business activity in which he embarked as a 
young tradesman, and thus has gained a thorough and comprehensive knowl- 
edge of the business, which combined with his unflagging enterprise and 
keen discernment have made him one of the most successful controllers of 
the great productive industries of British Columbia. He is also connected 
with the grocery business in Vancouver, where is conducted a large retail 
establishment. 

Mr. McNair was happily married in 1887 to Miss Minnie G. McKay, 
who was born in Dalhousie, New Brunswick, and is a daughter of Alexander 
McKay, also a representative of an old Scotch family. They have two children, 
a son and daughter, the former, R. W. M. McNair, born in New Brunswick, 
and the latter, E. L. McNair, in Vancouver. Mr. and Mrs. McNair are 
members of the Knox Congregational church, in which he is serving as 
deacon and also as chairman of the board of managers. He is likewise act- 
ive in the work of the Young Men's Christian Association, and for the past 
three years has been president of that worthy organization. His is a well 
balanced mind, not so abnormally developed in any direction as tO' make him 
a genius, but marked by steady growth along many lines he has won notable 
success in business, and at the same time has given due attention to intellect- 
ual and moral development, being the champion of many movements and 
measures which have contributed in these ways to the growth and progress 
of his adopted city. 

THOMAS F. NEELANDS. 

Thomas F. Neelands, one of the builders and pioneers of Vancouver, 
has advanced its interests through various operations which have resulted 
in not only personal benefit, but have been an important factor in the im- 
provement of the city. He has also contributed to public progress through 
his administration of the office of mayor, and has upheld its moral and com- 
mercial development. Thus his efforts have contributed to the general good 
along various lines, and Vancouver honors him as one of its representative 



66« BRITISH COLUMBIA 

men. He has resided here continually since 1885, or prior to the city's in- 
corporation. 

A native of Canada, Mr. Neelands was born in Ontario on the 8th of 
March, 1862, and is of Irish lineage. His great-grandfather, Gregg Nee- 
lands, his grandfather, John Neelands, and his father, William Neelands, 
were all born in county Cavan, Ireland, and together they emigrated to the 
new world, settling in Canada in 1832, upon a tract of land in the province of 
Ontario. They became pioneer farmers there, active in reclaiming the wild 
lands for purposes of civilization, and there their efforts contributed to the 
substantial development and material upbuilding of the community. Gregg 
Neelands lived to a very advanced age, having sometime passed the eightieth 
milestone on life's journey ere called to his final rest. John Neelands, how- 
ever, died at the age of fifty-nine years, while William Neelands passed away 
at the age of sixty-six years. They were a family of Methodists, joining that 
church in its infancy as followers of Wesley. Generations were represented 
by pious men who became pillars of the church and were devoted to the 
welfare of their fellow men. William Neelands married Miss Mary A. 
Hicks, who was also born in county Cavan, Ireland, a daughter of John 
Hicks, who in leaving the Emerald Isle took up his abode in Ontario. Six 
sons and two daughters were born of this marriage, four sons and two 
daughters of whom are still living. 

Thomas F. Neelands was educated in the schools of Ottawa City, after 
which he removed to Winnipeg, where he remained for three years and nine 
months. The great west attracted him, how'ever, and he arrived in 1885 on 
the present site of the city of Vancouver. Since that time he has been closely 
identified with its business and municipal interests, and his enterprise has con- 
tributed to the work of upbuilding in large and beneficial manner. He was 
engaged in the commission and contracting business for a short time, meet- 
ing with fair success, and then became connected w^ith the Pacific Loan &amp; 
Building Society. He has also been a dealer in real estate on his own ac- 
count, erecting several of the buildings of the city and negotiating many 
realty transfers. 

In his political views and actions Mr. Neelands has maintained an inde- 
pendent policy, desiring the greatest good for the greatest number. He was 
elected alderman in 1897, 1898, 1900 and 1901, and that his official service 
was satisfactory to the people and won their entire confidence is indicated by 
the fact that he was chosen for the high office of mayor, acting in that capac- 
ity in 1902 and 1903. It was during his administration that the City.Hospi- 
tal was placed in the hands of a private board of control, a step that has 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 667 

proved a wise and beneficial one, as acknowledged by all. Other progres- 
sive and helpful measures were instituted by or received the support of Mr. 
Xeelands. Several blocks of land in different parts of the city were secured 
for park purposes, and also a portion of water frontage on English Bay was 
secured by the city for bathing and recreation purposes, adding largely to 
the beauty as well as the benefit of Vancouver. Mr. Neelands, although fig- 
uring in political affairs, has never been a politician in the sense of office 
seeking, and has declined on two occasions to become a candidate for the 
local legislature. 

On the 26th of April, 1888, was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Nee- 
lands and Miss Mary E. Macey, who was born in Markham, Ontario, and 
is of English lineage. They are valued adherents of the Methodist church, 
and Mr. Neelands had the honor of being a trustee of one of the first churches 
built in the city after its incorporation. He belongs to the Masonic order, 
and is also a member of all branches of the Independent Order of Odd Fel- 
lows, and is now serving as grand master of the British Columbia jurisdic- 
tion. He is likewise connected with the Knights of Pythias, and through 
his fraternal relations has extended his acquaintance and won many warm 
friendships. He stands as a high type of progressive citizenship. In politi- 
cal thought and action he has ever been independent, carrying out his honest 
convictions without fear or favor. No trust reposed in him has ever been 
betrayed in the slightest degree, and the general public entertains for him the 
highest respect, while those with whom he has been more intimately asso- 
ciated give him warm friendship and unqualified regard. 

GEORGE HENRY COWAN, K. C. 

The name of George H. Cowan, K. C, throughout British Columbia 
stands sponsor for the claims of the Province upon the Dominion for better 
terms, and it is as an advocate by speech and pen of provincial rights that 
he is perhaps best known. Born at Warwick, Ontario, of Irish parentage, 
William and Anne (King) Cowan, he no doubt inherited from his ancestry 
something of his conservative leanings in politics and his Evangelical views 
in church matters. He received his education in the Collegiate Institutes 
of Strathroy and Brantford and in the University of Toronto, from which in 
1884 he was graduated with the degree of B. A., and with first class honors 
in Logic, in Mental and Moral Science and Civil Polity. He then pursued 
the study of law in Toronto and in November, 1889, was called to the bar. 
He began practice in London, Ontario, the firm being Cowan &amp; Gunn, which 
continued until the spring of 1893, when he came to Vancouver. Here he 



668 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

formed the partnership of Cowan &amp; Shaw and later Cowan, Kappele &amp; Mc- 
Evoy, which has since enjoyed a profitable share of the legal business of the 
city and district. In 1896 Mr. Cowan was appointed Queen's counsel by 
the Dominion Government, and in 1905 King's counsel by the British 
Columbia government. 

Besides being an able legal practitioner whose ability and achievements 
have proved an ornament to his city and province, Mr. Cowan has done much 
valuable research work in problems that affect the welfare of British Colum- 
bia. His article in the Canadian Encyclopaedia on the " Chinese Question " 
did much to prepare the minds of the East for the imposition of the present 
Chinese head tax. The immigration law drafted by him, and year after 
year enacted at Victoria and disallowed at Ottawa, has proven the only 
effective check of the kind the province has ever had to undesirable immigra- 
tion. 

But it is his services in the cause of better terms for British Columbia 
which find most grateful recognition. His written work on the subject had 
no sooner issued from the press than it was looked upon as an important 
state document, and some of the speeches in which he has expounded and 
amplified his views lay down fundamental principles so broad and clear with 
a display of knowledge so rich and accurate and an analysis of facts and 
theories so keen and thorough that they stand unsurpassed in the political 
history of the province. 

In the Dominion elections of 1896 Mr. Cowan was the straight Conserv- 
ative nominee in Vancouver, his opponents being the late George R. Max- 
well, as an independent, and W. J. Bowser, as an independent Conservative. 
Mr. Maxwell was elected over Mr. Cowan by a narrow majority. 

Mr. Cowan married in 1897 Miss Josephine Irene Downie, a daughter of 
the Rev. Canon Downie, of Watford, Ontario. They have four children 
by the marriage, three daughters and one son. As a member of the Church 
of England and in its synods, his sympathies are distinctly Evangelical. His 
fraternal associations are with the Masonic order. 

JOHN W. COBURN. 

John W. Coburn, of Ladysmith, has been prominently and closely identi- 
fied with the business and civic interests of this town, and was one of the fore- 
most factors in making it the commercial and industrial center which it now 
is, and he is still using his influence and efforts in every possible way to en- 
large and promote its future possibilities and resources. His citizenship is 
public-spirited and progressive in a high degree, and just such enterprise as he 



■1 (I , V 1 !'( ^' 

i 1', s; •■■. I ' 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 669 

has manifested is the most valuable asset a growing town can have. Mr. 
Coburn is a successful business man, and, beginning in the time of boyhood, 
he has risen steadily, by diligence and application, through various grades of 
responsibility to his present prosperous place among the men of affairs in Brit- 
ish Columbia. 

He was born near Frederickton, New Brunswick, August 30, 1859. His 
father, Andrew W. Coburn, is now living at Harvey, New Brunswick, and his 
mother, Elizabeth (Meeser) Coburn, is deceased. After a period of educa- 
tion in the public schools of New Brunswick, he took up railroad work, and 
that continued the principal line of his pursuit for many years. He moved to 
Winnipeg in 1884, and for a year was employed in a wholesale clothing house 
at that point. In 1885 he came to British Columbia, where he entered the 
employ of the late Robert Dunsmuir, and was sent out as the first trainman on 
the construction of the Esquimault and Nanaimo Railroad. He remained in 
the employ of that road for sixteen years and three months, in various capaci- 
ties, principally as railway conductor. He severed his connection with the rail- 
road in September, 1901, and then formed the Ladysmith Lumber Company, 
of which he is now managing director and largest stockholder. He also as- 
sisted in the formation of " The Shawnigan Lake Lumber Company," of which 
he is still a director. He has been successfully engaged in the lumber business 
for the past three years, and has become a substantial and reliable factor in 
the business circles of the district. He is president of " The Ladysmith Hard- 
ware Company, Limited." 

The affairs of his home town have always held Mr. Coburn's attention, 
and he has been a leader in developing Ladysmith. He served as alderman 
of Wellington for one year, and in 1900 was elected mayor of that munici- 
pality and served as such until the town was disincorporated. He was one of 
the prime movers in securing the incorporation of Ladysmith, and was elected 
mayor of the town by acclamation in 1904, and also in 1905. He is a staunch 
(Conservative in politics, and the family religion is Presbyterianism. His 
fraternal affiliations are with St. John's Lodge, No. 19, A. F. &amp; A. M., and 
with the Ancient Order of United Workmen. 

Mr. Coburn was first married on December 13, 1892, to Miss Ellen C. 
Little, a daughter of David Little, of Harvey, New Brunswick. By this 
union there are two children, Leila Maud and Dora Pauline, whose mother 
died at Nanaimo on November 6, 1895. On February 2, 1899, Mr. Coburn 
married Miss Ellen Cowie, a daughter of Alexander Cowie, of Fannie Bay, 
British Columbia. The two children of this marriage are Wallace Andrew 
and Gordon Hastings. 



670 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

HON. THOMAS ROBERT McINNES. 

Hon. Thomas Robert Mclnnes, late lieutenant-governor of the province 
of- British Columbia, was born at Lake Ainslie, Nova Scotia, on the 5th of 
November, 1840, and w^as of Highland Scotch ancestry. His father, John 
Mclnnes, was born in Inverness, Scotland, and married Miss Mary Hamil- 
ton, a daughter of Captain Edward Hamilton, of Paisley, Scotland. De- 
sirous of seeking a home in the new world and of enjoying its business ad- 
vantages, John Mclnnes left the land of hills and heather and located at Lake 
Ainslie, Nova Scotia, in 1825. Prior to this time he had been a sea cap- 
tain, but in the new world he turned his attention to farming, owning lands 
there. 

Governor Mclnnes was educated in the normal school at Truro, Nova 
Scotia, and then matriculated in Harvard University at Boston, Massachu- 
setts, where he took a medical course. With broad general knowledge to 
serve as the foundation upon which to rear the superstructure of professional 
learning he then began preparation for the practice of medicine and was 
graduated from Rush Medical College of Chicago, Illinois. During the 
latter part of the Civil war in the United States he offered his services to the 
south as a sifrgeon and acted in that capacity until the close of hostilities. 
Subsequent to the close of the war he established his home in Dresden, Kent 
county, Ontario, and was there happily married in 1866 to Mrs. Martha E. 
Webster, of that place, the widow of George Webster, of Dresden. 

Governor Mclnnes had not long been a resident of Dresden until his 
abilities were recognized in a public way by his election to the office of reeve 
(mayor) of the town. His loyalty and fidelity to duty stood as unquestioned 
facts in his career and in 1874 he was nominated for the Ontario legislature. 
This honor, however, he declined, for he had decided to remove to New 
W^estminster, British Columbia, and in the spring of 1874 he came tO' the 
province and entered upon the practice of his profession, his efforts being at- 
tended with marked success. Again he was called to public office by those 
who recognized his fitness for leadership and his devotion to the general 
good, being chosen mayor of the city. He thus controlled its municipal 
affairs during the years 1877 ^^^ 1878. He also continued in the active 
practice of his profession and was appointed surgeon of the Royal Colum- 
bia Hospital and superintendent of the British Columbia Insane Asylum. 
Further honors of a partly political nature were conferred upon him when 
in 1879 he was elected to the house of commons at a by-election as an inde- 
pendent candidate, defeating the Conservative candidate. At the general 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 671 

election of that year he was again chosen for the position. In 1881 he was 
appointed senator by Lord Lome and took a very active part in shaping the 
political policy of the province at that time. Desirous of promoting the 
general welfare and laboring for the greatest good to the greatest number 
he championed many measures, the value and benefit of which are now widely 
acknowledged. He took great interest in establishing a Canada mint, and 
was the first to advocate such an enterprise. He studied closely cjuestions of 
national and international importance, and was the first to advocate a board 
of reciprocity with the United States, but because of the attitude of the 
United States concerning the tariff question this was not carried into effect, 
and Governor Mclnnes subsequently became an imperial federationist. In 
1898 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of the province. The politics of 
the country was then in a transition state, which resulted in the establish- 
ment of federal party lines. During his term of office he dismissed the Tur- 
ner ministry in July, 1898, and this occasion caused much ix)litical turmoil, 
but he was sustained therein by the legislature. In 1900 the Semlin gov- 
ernment which had dismissed the Hon. Joseph Martin from its cabinet was 
in turn dismissed by the governor. On being defeated in the legislature the 
Hon. Joseph Martin was then called upon to form a government and this 
movement, because of the bitter opposition to Mr. Martin by leading members 
of both parties, resulted in official antagonism at Ottawa against the gov- 
ernor, and Mr. Martin v;as defeated at a general election, and the governor 
was called upon to resign. This he refused to do on the grounds that his 
action had been constitutional, but it was overruled by the government of 
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and in June, 1900, he was dismissed. There has never 
been any doubt, however, that he was ever true to his honest convictions and 
his course was sustained by many eminent men of the province. 

Retiring from politics Governor Mclnnes came to Vancouver to make 
his home. In 1901 he traveled through Australia and New Zealand and 
made a close study of the political measures and noticed particularly the 
government ownership of the railroads, for of such a course he had always 
been a strong advocate. While on this tour he was the guest of the various 
premiers of the Australian states and New Zealand, and was given every 
opportunity of observing the workings of their governments. In 1903 he 
was made an independent candidate by the house of commons in a by-elec- 
tion held in Vancouver, but was defeated. He departed this life on the 
19th of March, 1904. 

Governor Mclnnes had been an enthusiastic rifleman and he served as 
president of the Senate Rifle Club of Ottawa and also of Vancouver Rifle 



672 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Association, and he advised proficiency with the rifle rather than attention 
to drill or parade, and advocated that all boys over fourteen years of age in 
the schools should be instructed in the use of the rifles. Governor Mclnnes 
was reared in the Presbyterian faith, which had been that of his ancestors, 
and his life was at all times actuated by honorable principles and manly pur- 
poses. As the result of his professional skill and business capacity he at one 
time became the owner of fine property, but he also had other mining specu- 
lations. He was a skilled physician and surgeon, was an honest man and 
possessing strong convictions had the courage to stand by them. 

Governor Mclnnes and his wife had two sons. The younger, W. W. 
B. Mclnnes, was born in Dresden, Ontario, on the 8th of April, 1871, and 
pursued his education in the New Westminster high school and Toronto 
University, being graduated from the latter institution with the degree of 
Bachelor of Arts in 1889. In 1893 he was called to the bar of British 
Columbia and began his practice in Nanaimo. In 1896 he was elected as 
an independent Liberal tO' the house of commons, defeating Andrew Haslam, 
who had filled the seat during the previous teiTn. While in the house he 
was the youngest member and was assigned the honor of making the speech 
in reply to the address from the throne under the Liberal regime of Sir Wil- 
frid Luarier. From the beginning of his political career his brilliant oratory 
attracted attention throughout the Dominion. In 1900 he resigned his seat 
and in the provincial campaign was a staunch supporter of the Hon. Joseph 
Martin, and was elected to the local legislature. In 1903 he was chosen at 
a by-election as provincial secretary in the government of the Hon. Colonel 
E. G. Prior, and in 1903 at the general election he was re-elected a member 
of the provincial house. He resides in Nanaimo, where he is practicing his 
profession. 

The elder son, T. R. E. Mclnnes, was born in Dresden, Ontario, on 
the 29th of October, 1867, and was educated at Ne\A^ Westminster, attending 
the high school there, and was also a student in Trinity College school, of 
Port Hope, and in the Toronto University, being graduated from the last 
named in the class of 1889 with the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He was 
then called to the bar of British Columbia in 1893 and practiced in connec- 
tion with his brother in Nanaimo until April, 1896, in which year he was 
made secretary to the Canadian commissioner of the Behring sea claims 
commission. In 1897 he went to Skagv^^ay with a force of police and cus- 
toms official. This was at the time of the Klondike rush. He was his 
father's private scretary during Governor Mclnnes' administration and was 
afterward secretary of the British Columbia commission. Since that time 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 673 

he became a member of the law firm of Cane &amp; Mclnnes, his partner being 
G. Filmore Cane. 

On the 20th of December, 1889, Mr. Mclnnes was married to Miss 
Laura Hostetter, a daughter of John Hostetter, late of Toronto, and they 
have one child, Loftus. 

EDGAR FAWCETT. 

Edgar Fawcett, a Victoria pioneer of 1859, is one of the best informed 
men in the city concerning the history and material development of this 
portion of the province, and he himself has taken no insignificant part in 
affairs of a general public nature. He has furnished the papers of the city 
with a number of well written and interesting articles containing valuable 
reminiscences of early days in Victoria, and is a recognized authority along 
these lines and takes much pride in preserving and publishing to the world 
the records of this flourishing city of British Columbia. 

Mr. Fawcett is a native of Australia, having been born during the few- 
years of the family's residence in that country. He was born at Sydney, 
February i, 1847, ^iid the ancestry on both sides is of substantial English 
stock. His father, Thomas Lea Fawcett, was born in Kidderminster, Eng- 
land, and during his adult career there was a carpet manufacturer. His 
mother was born in Birmingham, and her father was a manufacturer. Mr. 
Fawcett, Sr., was a cousin of Sir Rowland Hill, late P. M., of England, 
They emigrated to Australia in 1838, and remained there until 1849, in 
which year they emigrated to San Francisco, becoming pioneers of Cali- 
fornia, arriving February, 1850. In that state his father invested in a vessel 
v/hich he employed in freighting lumber from British Columbia to England, 
but in 1857 this vessel was lost in the Fuca straits, causing him a severe 
financial embarrassment. In 1858 the father preceded his family to Vic- 
toria, where he hoped to recoup his losses, and where the remainder of the 
family followed in 1859. He lived an honored citizen of this city for some 
thirty years, having filled the office of government agent at Nanaimo for 
three years. In 1889 he returned to England, and died there at the age of 
seventy-six years. In Birmingham, England, in 1838, he had married Miss 
Jane Wignall, and they l3ecame the parents of six children, two of whom 
now reside in British Columbia, namely : Rowland W. and Edgar, and a 
third son, Arthur, is in London, England. 

Mr. Fawcett was a boy of twelve years when the family located at Vic- 
toria, and in that early period of the city's history, when there was little 
more than a village on the site of the old fort, he used his observing facili- 



674 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ties to good advantage and carries in his memory exact impressions of early 
events and scenes as he saw them then. He received his education in this 
city at the collegiate school and the Colonial school. He began his business 
career in the upholstering business, which he continued with his brother 
until 1882. In that year he entered the Dominion civil service, at first as 
a clerk in the custom house, and for the past twenty-three years he has given 
this branch of government work his undivided attention. He has been pro- 
moted from time to time until he is now assistant appraiser and in charge 
of the postal package office. 

Mr. Fawcett served as sergeant in the old Victoria Rifle Volunteers, 
which were lately merged in the Canada militia under Colonel Wolfinden. 
He was also among the first to join the volunteer fire department, of the city. 
He has been a member of the British Columbia Pioneer Society since its 
organization, and is now the only remaining charter member. He was sec- 
retary at the first meeting of this society when it was organized in Smith's 
Hall, Government street, April 28, 1871. He is also a veteran member of 
the Odd Fellows, having joined that order in 1868, and he has the honor 
of being affiliated with the California Pioneers. 

Mr. Fawcett was happily married in 1870 to Miss Myra Holden, who 
was born in Mackelsfield, Yorkshire, England, and who has become the 
mother of six children, all born in Victoria. The eldest, Thomas Douglas, 
is now purser on the steamship " Princess Victoria ;" Edgar is an engineer 
on the " Empress of China ;" and Myra Louise, Olive Annie, Victor Cecil 
and Elizabeth Hazel are all at home. The family have a beautiful residence, 
situated on Victoria arm, and which they have fitly called " Dingley Dell." 
They are members of the Reformed Episcopal church, and he is a member of 
the church committee, and was very active when this denomination was or- 
ganized about thirty-one years ago. 

FREDERICK BUSCOMBE. 

Frederick Buscombe, whose intense and well directed business activity 
has made him a leading- factor in the commercial circles of Vancouver, where 
he is now conducting a large wholesale and retail china and glassware estab- 
lishment, first visited the site of Vancouver in 1884, although the few little 
buildings which then marked the city were not called by its present name. 
In the same year he visited Victoria, and again in 1886 he came to Vancou- 
ver, but did not take up his permanent residence here until 1891, since which 
time he has figured prominently in its mercantile circles. 

Frederick Buscombe, born in Bodmin, England, on the 2d of Septem- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 675 

ber, 1862, is of Cornish ancestry. His father, also a native of Bodmin, 
was married there to Miss Isatella Oliver, a native of Liskeard, Coirnwall, 
and in 1870 they sailed for Canada, locating' at Hamilton, Ontario, where 
the father began contracting and building. He is still engaged in active 
business there, although now in his seventy-second year. He is a worthy 
member of the Church of England, and throughout his entire life he has 
commanded the respect and gxDod will of his fellow citizens. Unto him and 
his wife were born nine sons and a daughter, all of whom are living and 
constitute a most highly respected family. 

Frederick Buscombe and his brother George, who is associated with him 
in business, are the only members of the family in British Columbia. The for- 
mer was in his eighth year at the time of his parents' emigration to Hamilton, 
Ontario, and there he acquired his education. He became familiar with the 
china and glassware trade as an employe in the house of James A. Skinner 
&amp; Company, dealers in those lines of merchandise, and opening the business 
in Vancouver for that house he remained a member of the firm until 1899, 
when he purchased the interest of his partners. Under Mr. Buscombe's 
management the business has grown to the largest wholesale and retail house 
of the kind west of Toronto, occupying eleven floors, twenty by one hundred 
and twenty feet, all filled with the choicest china and glassware and house 
furnishings. They find a ready market for their goods throughout British 
Columbia, the Northwest territory and the Yukon district. This is the only 
wholesale china house in Vancouver and enjoys a large city trade in addi- 
tion to the out of town shipments. Not only has Mr. Buscombe developed 
a profitable and extensive business, but enjoys the fullest confidence of the 
leading business men of the city as well, and has the respect and good will 
of the purchasing public. 

Mr. Buscombe has noted with interest the possibilities of the country 
and its development and has co-operated in many measures for the general 
good. He was formerly president of the Board of Trade, and is a member 
of its council and the board of arbitration. He is far sighted and in mat- 
ters of business policy and possibility his judgment is rarely, if ever, at fault. 

On the 6th of May, 1886, Mr. Buscombe was united in marriage to 
Miss Lydia Rebecca Mattice, a native of Ontario, and they have five chil- 
dren, two sons and three daughters : Robert Frederick Edwin, Harold Ed- 
win, Erie Stewart, Margery Gordon and Barnett. Mr. Buscombe and his 
family are communicants of the Church of England, in the work of which 
he takes an active and helpful part. He was one of the members promi- 
nently engaged in the building of Christ church, one of the finest houses of 



076 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

worship in the city. He belongs to the Masonic fraternity and is a past 
master of Cascade lodge, No. 12, A. F. &amp; A. M., of Vancouver, while in 
the Scottish rite he has attained the eighteenth degree. His business career 
has been marked by consecutive progress along modern lines of merchandis- 
ing, and the success of marked enterprise and honorable effort is today his. 

JAMES LEIGH AND SONS. 

James Leigh and Sons is a firm that has maintained a high reputation 
ever since its founding in Victoria over fifteen years ago, and the extent and 
high class of all its manufactured products and the integrity and business 
ability of its individual members are estimated among the most valuable 
assets of the prosperity and general advancement of this city. The firm 
manufacture lumber and all kinds of building material, such as doors, sash 
and blinds, mantles, and all wood finishings used for building purposes. Their 
mills are located in Victoria, and their trade extends throughout the north- 
west and is constantly being increased under the able and progressive man- 
agement of the members of the firm. 

The founder of this large enterprise was Mr. James Leigh, deceased, 
whose life of broad and useful activity is deserving of special notice. Born 
in Herefordshire, Wales, in 1826, and married there to Miss Jane Jones, a 
native of the same locality, he some time later, with their son Albert, 
emigrated to the state of New York, locating in that state in 1848. He later 
removed from New York state to Ontario, locating at Kingston. At Port 
Hope and New Castle he was engaged in the manufacture of carriages, and 
for a number of years had charge of the work of the Massey Company located 
at New Castle. He then went to Ponto Pool, and was the builder of the 
first circular sawmill in that county. He afterward moved to Orono and 
established extensive machine works there, which works are still carried on 
by the oldest son. Albert. Another enterprise of this active man was the 
erection of a flouring mill in Bellville and also one at Penetanguishene, the 
latter of which he conducted until he came out to this province, and in part- 
nership with Mr. Synder, built a sawmill at Gold Stream in 1888. This was 
conducted for two years, and in 1890-91 Mr. Leigh built the mill at Victoria 
and began his connection with the manufacturing affairs of this city. This 
is a steam mill and has a daily capacity, of ten hours' running, of twenty-five 
thousand feet of lumber, and in connection is a shingle mill which turns out 
every ten hours of operation fifty thousand shingles. The raw lumber ma- 
terial for this extensive manufacture is at present purchased from other lum- 
bermen, but the company has a heavily timbered tract four miles square, and 



\' 1 1 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 6TT 

this will be utilized in the near future. The excellent wood products of this 
firm find ready sale in this part of the country, and are held in high repute 
wherever used. 

Mr. James Leigh died in 1898, aged seventy-three years, after a career of 
continued activity and usefulness from his earliest until his last years. He 
was a member of the Church of England, a man of known high character and 
integrity, and made a fine record in every undertaking. His good wife sur- 
vives him and is now seventy-seven years of age. The sons, John L. and Sidney 
Minton, are the present owners of the Victoria business, and are still conduct- 
ing it under the name by which it has become so well known to business circles. 
John L. Leigh was born in Ponty Pool, Ontario, in 1861, and his brother S. 
M. was born in Orono in 1867. Both were reared to the lumber manufactur- 
ing business, and are practical and capable business men, endowed with all 
the qualities that insure success. Mr. J. L. Leigh was married in 1894 to 
Miss Laura E. LaPage, a native of Guernsey Island, England. Their three 
children, all born in Victoria, are Victor, Edna and Byron. Mr. S. M. Leigh 
married Miss Charlotte Mason, a native of Ireland, and their four children 
are Nora, Albert, Ethel and Sidney Minton. Both families are Methodists 
in religion, and enjoy the high esteem of a wide circle of friends and acquaint- 
ances, 

CHARLES GEORGE MAJOR. 

Few men can claim intimate knowledge of the history of New West- 
minster through as long a period as can Mr. Major, who arrived here on 
the 1st of June, 1859. Gold had been discovered on the Eraser river in 
1858 and it was the hope of rapidly acquiring a fortune that brougnt him 
to the west. He went through the usual experiences of the miner who 
leaves the comforts and conveniences that form a part of life in the older 
east and braves hardships, difficulties and dangers in his search for the 
precious metal. It is such men, however, that lay the foundation for the 
present progress and prosperity of the province, and as a pioneer settler Mr. 
Major deserves the gratitude of the younger generation for what he did in 
planning the city's present development. 

Of English ancestry Charles George Major was born in Ontario, 
Canada, in 1839. His father, Richard Major, was born in England, and 
was married there to Miss A. M. Johnson, a native of that country. The 
year 1830 witnessed their removal from the old world to the new, and they 
located on land five miles from Sarnia. Mr. Major was a farmer and black- 
smith who lived an industrious, useful and active life. Both he and his 



678 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

wife were members of the Church of England. He died in the fiftieth year 
of his age, while Mrs. Major lived to the advanced age of seventy-six years. 
They were the parents of eight children, three of whom are living. 

Charles G. Major of this review was educated in his native town, and 
at an early age started out in life for himself, securing a clerkship in a dry 
goods store, where he completed a three years' apprenticeship under the 
direction of the late Hon. John Robson and his brother. The contract was 
that he would be paid but forty dollars for the first year, sixty dollars for 
the second year and one hundred dollars for the third year, in addition to 
his board, but such was the value of his services to his employers that they 
gave him a larger wage than was agreed upon and he continued in their 
employ for a year following the completion of his apprenticeship, receiving 
from them a larger salary than that of any other clerk. He has been con- 
tinuously in business relations with them since that time. 

On the first of June, 1859, Mr. Major arrived in New Westminster 
and in 1862 he went to the Cariboo mines, remaining in that district during 
the years 1862-3-4, during which time he worked for the express company, 
taking the gold to the markets oil pack horses. In 1864 he returned to New 
Westminster and began merchandising in connection with John C. Clute. 
In 1870 the latter gentleman decided to go to Missouri and Mr. Major then 
continued in the business alone until 1887, when he retired from merchandis- 
ing and invested his capital in real estate. He then engaged in the real 
estate business with good success, and before it was known that Vancouver 
was to be the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railroad Mr. Major invested 
in property there, which has constantly increased in value, owing to the 
rapid growth of the city. H'e still has much desirable real estate in Van- 
couver and likewise valuable property in New Westminster. He also con- 
ducts a large insurance business and is the government administrator for the 
district of New Westminster, extending as far as North Bend. He pos- 
sesses excellent ability as financier and is known as a man of unremitting 
energy and close application, whose efforts have been so carefully and dis- 
cerningly directed that he has gained a most gratifying success. 

In 1867 Mr. Major was married to Miss Mary Elizabeth Clarkson, a 
daughter of William Clarkson, who was one of the prominent early pioneers 
of that province. She is a sister of Mrs. J. S. Clute and Mrs. John C. 
Brown, all worthy pioneer women of British Columbia. This union has 
been blessed with four children, as follows: Edith Eleanor, who is now the 
wife of Thomas Robson Pearson; Mildred Jane, now the wife of John A. 
Lee; Harry Clarkson, and Frank. Mr. Major holds membership in the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 679 

Methodist church, to which Mrs. Major also belonged, being for a long 
period an active and highly valued representative of that denomination. 
She died in the year 1903, and her loss was deeply deplored, for she was a 
woman of lovable christian character, devoted to the welfare of her family 
and friends, kind to the poor and sympathetic with the sorrowing, in fact 
her many splendid qualities of heart and mind endeared her to all who knew 
her. Mr. Major has been an active officer and working member of the 
church for the past forty years and his influence has ever been on the side 
of right, progress, reform and improvem.ent. He was one of the first pilot 
commissioners appointed on the mainland, and he still holds that office. His 
life record forms a connecting link between the primitive past and the pro- 
gressive present, and he stands today as one of the honored pioneers of the 
province, having ever been true to its best interests and to the principles of 
an upright manhood. 

JOHN STILWELL CLUTE. 

John Stilwell Clute, inspector of customs at New Westminster, is a 
British Columbia pioneer of 1862. He was born near Kingston, Ontario, 
on the 15th of June, 1840. John S. Clute, father of John Stilwell Clute of 
this review, was born in 1801, and spent the greater part of his life in 
eastern Canada, but in his later years came to New Westminster, making 
his home with his son. He died at the venerable age of ninety-five years. 
He had served the government during the Mackenzie revolution of 1837, 
and had also done government service as a civil officer, being a collector of 
customs, and at the time of his death was the oldest civil servant in the 
Superannuation list. 

John Stilwell Clute is the only member of the family in British Colum- 
bia. He was educated in Kingston, Ontario, until his tenth year, and then 
removed to Picton with his father, who had been appointed a customs of- 
ficer there. He then entered the schools of that place and after putting aside 
his text books he accepted a position in a drug store with the intention of 
later studying medicine. After a year, however, he abandoned that idea 
and removed to Port Hope, where he entered the dry goods establishment 
of his brother-in-law, being engaged for a time in selling goods. In i860 
he made his way southward to Houston, Texas, and there filled the position 
of secretary to the Texas Telegraph Company, the first company putting a 
line in operation in that state. 

The Civil war breaking out in April, 1861, Mr. Clute after a few months 
decided to return to Ontario, where he remained until the spring of 1862, 



680 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

when he started for British Columbia, landing at Esquimault on the 4th of 
May of that year. He only remained for a short time at Victoria, and soon 
started with others for the Cariboo country, but later decided to accept a 
situation in New Westminster and sent his companions on with the provisions 
they had procured for the expedition. Mr. Clute became a clerk in a general 
merchandise store owned by J. A. Webster. He continued at this work 
until the fall of 1863, when in connection with C. G. Major he formed a 
partnership and embarked in general merchandising on his own account 
under the firm style of Clute &amp; Major, continuing in that business success- 
fully until 1870, when he sold out his interest in the business. In that year 
Mr. Clute removed to Sedalia, Missouri, where he embarked in business in 
connection with James M. Clute, under the firm name of Clute Brothers. 
For five years he conducted a successful mercantile enterprise there and then 
sold his interests and returned to New Westminster. 

In 1866 Mr. Clute married Miss Jennie Clarkson, second daughter of 
Mr. William Clarkson, of New Westminster, a British Columbia pioneer 
of 1858. To Mr. and Mrs. Clute have been born nine children, eight of 
whom are yet living. The family are members of the Episcopal church, 
Mr. Clute being a church officer of the parish of St. Barnabas, New West- 
minster. 

Mr. Clute was appointed to the Customs Service as collector at the 
port of New Westminster in 1878, and in 1889 he had added to his duties 
as collector the office of inspector, he holding the dual positions until 1896, 
when he was at his own request relieved of the office of collector and assumed 
the office of inspector of ports for British Columbia. Before becoming a 
civil servant he took a very active interest in city affairs, doing every- 
thing in his power to promote its well being, and was an active worker for 
confederation. He served as a member of the city council for a number of 
years, and was elected president of the council in 1868, this position being 
the equivalent of mayor. He also served on the school board, and was al- 
ways found in the front rank in supporting every measure which he deemed 
would prove of public benefit. 

Mr. Clute has likewise been prominent in Masonic circles and has 
thoroughly informed himself concerning the tenets and teachings of the 
order. He belongs to Union lodge. No. 9, A. F. &amp; A. M., of New West- 
minster, which received its charter in 1861. He attained the sublime degree 
of a Master Mason therein in 1863 and soon became one of its prominent 
and most efficient members, filling all of its positions and being now the 
oldest past master. He has the honor of being past grand master of the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 681 

grand lodge of Masons of the province of British Columbia, and he is now 
the only active surviving member of Union lodge, that was identified there- 
with when he took his degrees in 1863. He has the entire confidence of 
his brethren of the fraternity and is a worthy exemplar of this craft, which 
has for its basic element kindness, helpfulness and charity. 

Mr. Clute has a delightful home in this city, in which he has spent the 
greater part of his life, he has seen many changes, and the country today 
bears scarcely a resemblance to the district to which he made his way in 
1862. The natural resources of the country had then scarcely been touched, 
but the years have brought population, and men of enterprise and business 
capacity have improved the splendid opportunities offered, and have de- 
veloped here cities of phenomenal growth, having every evidence of ad- 
vanced and cultivated civilization. Mr. Clute has borne his full share in 
this work of public progress, and his name should be inscribed high on the 
roll of sturdy and honored pioneers. 

JOHN F. ROSS. 

John F. Ross, president of the Ross &amp; Howard Foundry Company, 
Limited, thus figures prominently in business circles in Vancouver, and his 
intense and well directed energy have enabled him to advance from a humble 
financial position to one of affluence. He is a native of Scotland, his birth 
having occurred in Perth, on the 12th of September, 1841, and in that coun- 
try his ancestors had resided through many generations. His father, David 
Ross, was born in Scotland and married Miss Betsey Ferrier, who was also 
born in Scotland. He followed the trade of a mason and builder and other 
construction work, in this way providing for his family, and was also 
actively identified with the improvement of the locality in which he made 
his home. He and his wife enjoyed the warm regard of many friends be- 
cause of their excellent traits of heart and mind. They hold membership 
in the Presbyterian church, and their entire lives were permeated by their 
Christian faith, they endeavoring to follow closely the teachings of the de- 
nomination. Mr. Ross attained the venerable age of eighty years, while 
his wife lived to be seventy-seven years of age. They were the parents 
of six children, but John F. Ross is the only one who has left Scotland. 

Having acquired his education in the schools of Perth, John F. Ross 
learned the joiner's and cabinet-maker's trade, serving a four years' ap- 
prenticeship, being paid two shillings and six pence a week, and afterward 
learned the pattern-maker's trade in Dundee. At the end of his term of in- 
denture, however, he was receiving four shillings and six pence per week. 



682 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

He then went to England in 1864 and for twenty-four years was actively 
engaged in business in Manchester and other leading manufacturing centers 
of England. He came direct from Manchester to Vancouver, arriving in 
British Columbia in 1889. There were then but six thousand inhabitants in 
the city, and he engaged in making patterns in the Vancouver City Foundry 
and Machine Works, Limited, for four years, after which he established his 
own manufacturing enterprise, in which he has met with remarkable success. 
Forming a partnership with James Howard, the factory was opened in 
1891. They are founders, pattern-makers, machinists and boiler manufac- 
turers and theirs is the pioneer business of this kind on the mainland. They 
had a small shop at first on Water street, but their patronage grew every 
year and the business is now carried on in a building on Carroll street, 
ninety-four by one hundred and forty feet. In addition to this they have 
at the east end of the city a large manufacturing plant, covering two and a 
half acres of ground and their output is in constant demand, being shipped 
all over the northwest. Their principal product is sawmill machinery, and 
for the past six years they have done the casting for the Canadian Pacific 
Railway. 

Mr. Ross was happily married in England in 1864 to Miss Jessie Flem- 
ing, who was born in Dundee, Scotland, in which country her ancestors had 
long been found. This union has been blessed with ten children, of whom 
seven are living. The eldest son, David John, is secretary and treasurer of 
the Ross &amp; Howard Company Foundry, Limited, and is one of Vancouver's 
respected business men, also holding membership in the Board of Trade. 
The eldest daughter, Jessie, married in England; Lizzie, is acting as her 
father's housekeeper. Maggie S. is filling a position as bookkeeper, and 
William is in Calgary. Mrs. Ross departed this life in 1891. She was a 
most faithful and devoted wife and loving mother, possessed many amiable 
traits of character and had a large circle of friends who held her in the 
highest esteem and who felt the deepest regret over her death. The com- 
panionship between Mr. and Mrs. Ross had been most congenial and her 
loss therefore came with greatest force to him. The family home is a nice 
residence in Vancouver, and the members of the houshold are occupying en- 
viable social positions. Mr. Ross and his children are members of the 
Mount Pleasant Presbyterian church. He has built a number of fine resi- 
dences in. the city and has done his full share in the upbuilding and improve- 
men of Vancouver during the fifteen years of his residence here. Faithful- 
ness to duty and strict adherence to a fixed purpose in life will do more to 
advance a man's interests than wealth or adventitious circumstances. The 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 683 

successful men of the day are they who have planned their own advance- 
ment and have accomplished it in spite of many obstacles and with a cer- 
tainty that could have been attained only through their own efforts. This 
class of men has a worthy representative in John F. Ross, who, coming to 
the province in 1889. has since made for himself a leading position in busi- 
ness circles, his life record proving that success and an honored name might 
be won simultaneously. 

SIMON JOHN TUNSTALL, B. A., M. D., C. M. 

Simon John Tunstall, M. D., has been successfully practicing his profes- 
sion in British Columbia for over twenty years, and since 1892 has been per- 
manently located in Vancouver. Born at St. Anne de Bellvue, province of 
Quebec, in 1852, he was a son of Gabriel Christie and Jessie (Fraser) Tuns- 
tall, who were both natives of Montreal, province of Quebec, and descended 
from pioneers identified with the early history of that province. On his 
father's side he was descended from the Rev. Mr. Tunstall, one of the first 
rectors of Christ church, Montreal, and chaplain to the forces in Canada in 
the early part of the nineteenth century; and from General Gabriel Christie, 
whose daughter became the wife of Rev. Mr. Tunstall. Through General 
Christie, Dr. Tunstall was a co-seigneur of the seigniory of Lacolle and de 
Beaujeu. On his mother's side his great-grandfathers were Major Fraser, 
who was at the taking of Quebec under Wolffe, and Donald McKay, one of 
the United Empire Loyalists, he having left estates in Albany to follow the 
flag in Canada. His grandfather, Simon Fraser, was one of the chief factors 
of the Hon. Northwest Company, his brother, Thomas Fraser, was in the 
Royals and acted as aide-de-camp to the Duke of Kent when in command of 
the forces in Canada, and died as a major general in India. 

Dr. Tunstall was educated at high school, Montreal, and prepared himself 
for his profession at McGill University, Montreal, from which he was grad- 
.uated first, in 1873, with the degree of B. A., and in 1875, with the degree of 
M. D., C. M. During his scholastic career he gained numerous honors, hav- 
ing won the Davidson gold medal at the high school, took the B. A. degree 
with first rank honors, and during his medical course he received the prize 
for his primary year and the Holmes gold medal was conferred upon him as 
first of his year in the graduating class. After practicing four years at 
Papineauville, province of Quebec, and one year in Montreal, Dr. Tunstall 
came to British Columbia in 1881. Two years were spent in Lytton, and the 
following nine years at Kamloops, where he was in charge of a large number 
of men during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railroad. He located 



684 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

in Vancouver in 1892. and has since enjoyed a very representative and profit- 
able practice in this phenomenal city of the great northwest. 

Dr. Tunstall, besides giving close attention to his practice, has partici- 
pated actively in a wide range of professional and public affairs. He is a past 
president of the Caledonian and St. Andrews societies and is president of the 
Veterans Association of Vancouver. He is a former president of the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, and is a past president of 
the Canadian Medical Association. He is one of the prominent Masons of 
the province, having been identified with the order a number of years and 
passed the chairs. Dr. Tunstall is a member of the Church of England, and 
at different times served as church warden and lay delegate to the synod. 

In 1885 Dr. Tunstall married Miss Marianne Lawson Innes, whose 
father, James H. Innes, was for many years a crown navy officer, located at 
Esquimault. Five daughters have been born unto Dr. and Mrs. Tunstall, 
whose names are : Janet Marianne, Marjorie Katharine. Dorothy Ella. 
Gwendoline Louise and Ruth Elizabeth Eraser. 

HON. JOHN S. HELMCKEN, M. R. C. S., L. S. A. 

John Sebastian Helmcken, who has long held a prominent place in the 
history of Victoria, and has also stood deservedly high in the medical pro- 
fession, was born in London, England, on the 5th of June, 1825, and is of 
pure German ancestry, his father being a native of Bremerlee; his mother's 
father, who was born in Misskirch, served as a soldier in Napoleon's army. 

John S. Helmcken received his early education in his native city, dur- 
ing which time he also' took private instruction from a Lutheran clergyman, 
under whom he studied and completed his literary branches. His father 
having died, it happened that Dr. Graves, of Trinity Square, Tower Hill, 
took a liking to the youngster, who became attached to the doctor's office, 
and intended to educate him for a druggist. In process of time he was 
taken gratis as an apprentice for four years (such being then the custom), 
during which he had to put up all the prescriptions, make pills and so forth, 
keep the surgery in order and attend to minor cases outside, including sur- 
gical cases. Before the expiration of the apprenticeship he became a stu- 
dent at Guys Hospital (six hundred beds), London, and at the end of the 
legal requirement, namely, four years, he obtained a diploma from the Royal 
College of Surgeons, England, and likewise a license from the Apothecaries 
Company. During this time his health became impaired, and Mr. Harri- 
son, a wonderfully liberal supporter of the hospital, a very benevolent man 
and treasurer of the same institution, offered him, as a reward of merit (he 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 685 

had captured several prizes), an appointment to the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany's ship Prince Rupert, on its voyage to the York Factory on Hudson's 
Bay and return. The voyage consumed about five months, and among his 
fellow passengers were Chief Factor Hargrave and his wife, and a num- 
ber of men belonging to the expedition in search of Sir John Franklin, the 
Arctic explorer. Mr. Helmcken returned from this journey (with Dr. Rae 
of the Hudson's Bay Company, the celebrated explorer, who was a passenger 
on the ship) restored in health, and he then spent another year in study, 
graduating at the expiration of that period from the Royal College of Sur- 
geons. He was then detailed to enter the British navy, but was dissuaded 
from that course and soon afterward received the appointment of surgeon to 
the passenger ship Malacca, Captain Conset, bound for Bombay (not Suez 
Canal then). This vessel was owned by Messrs. Wigram and Greeks, 
who built the pioneer Pacific steamer Beaver for the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany. For a year and a half they sailed the Indian seas, and returning to 
London the doctor received appointment as clerk and colonial surgeon to 
the Hudson's Bay Company at Vancouver Island. 

He accordingly sailed with eighty pioneer emigrants on the ship Nor- 
man Morrison, Captain VVishart, and in this voyage was successful in quell- 
ing an epidemic of small pox, enabling him to report but two deaths at the 
end of the trip. The ship arrived in Victoria in March, 1850, but before 
this the passengers were placed in quarantine in Esquimault harbor for two 
or three weeks, although the ship had been long free from the disease. A 
couple of months after his arrival at Victoria Mr. Helmcken was transferred 
to Fort Rupert, proceeding on the historic steamer Beaver, this being the 
time the coal mines were opened at that place. After a few months' resi- 
dence here, during which a munity of the employes, with a tragedy occa- 
sioned by the California gold fever occurred, he was suddenly recalled to 
Victoria, returning in a canoe, paddled by Indians, a wild lot in those days, 
running the gauntlet through coast enemies for three hundred miles with con- 
siderable danger, and only escaped because the savages had a great respect 
for Hudson's Bay Company men, "King George's white men/' carrying 
papers, arriving at Victoria at the end of December to attend Governor 
Blanchard, who of course had by this time recovered from his illness. Since 
that time, from the building of the first house to the last, he has maintained 
his residence in this lovely city. 

Dr. Helmcken has, of course, occupied several public positions in the 
political life of his community, and in 1855 was honored by being elected to 
the first legislative assembly of Vancouver Island. He was elected speaker. 



68t) BRITISH COLUMBIA 

and filled that position with ability and distinction for many years. Al- 
though a great opponent of confederation, he, when overpowered, endeavored 
to help to make it a success, and was one of the three sent to Ottawa to 
secure in the confederation terms favorable to British Columbia, the other 
members of the committee being Mr. Trutch, the chief (afterwards Sir 
Joseph, since deceased), and Dr. Carroll. In this mission they met with 
satisfactory success, the transcontinental railroad being made a condition of 
the union. Immediately after the completion of this mission Dr. Helm- 
cken was offered a senatorship, but declined the honor in order to give more 
especial attention to his children and large medical practice. He is an hon- 
ored member of the Pioneer Society, and in his political affiliation has al- 
ways been a moderate Conservative. After confederation he voluntarily 
retired from political life. 

The marriage of Dr. Helmcken and Miss Cecelia Douglas occurred on 
the 27th of December, 1852, she being the daughter of Sir James Douglas, 
the governor of the colony. Mrs. Helmcken, who was a most devoted 
wife and mother, has preceded him to the home beyond, and of their seven 
children four are now living, namely : Amelia, the wife of G. A. McTavish ; 
James Douglas, a prominent member of the medical fraternity in Victoria, 
the city of his birth; Harry Dallas, an ex-member of parliament and now 
a prominent king's counselor, practicing his profession in Victoria; and 
Edith Louisa Higgins, who is a widow and resides with her father, to whom 
she is greatly devoted. Dr. Helmcken has property interests in this city and 
on the island, and throughout the community he is recognized as a valued, 
respected citizen. 

ROBERT JARDINE. 

Only a comparatively few years have passed since British Columbia 
was practically cut off from communication with the east by high mountain 
ranges and almost impenetrable forests, but the pioneer ventured into the 
unsettled districts and the railroad builder made travel over the mountains 
and through the forests possible. Then the world came to know of the 
splendid natural resources of British Columbia which before had been reached 
by means of navigation only along the Pacific coast. Men came from the 
east to claim the riches of the region and to convert their labor into a market- 
able product through utilizing the means which nature had placed at their 
disposal. One of the most important industries which has sprung up in this 
section of the country^ is the manufacture of lumber, and it is of this great 
field of activity that Robert Jardine is a representative. He is classed with 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 687 

the prominent business men of New Westminster, being manager of the 
Royal City Mills, owned by the British Columbia Mills, Timber &amp; Trading 
Company. 

Mr. Jardine has been a resident of the province since i88q. He was 
born in Campbleton, New Brunswick, on the 28th of January, 1864, and is 
of Scotch ancestry. His grandfather. Robert Jardine, was born in Scotland 
and was married there to a Miss Fair. In 1832 they crossed the' Atlantic to 
New Brunswick, where John Jardine, father of Robert Jardine, was lx)rn. 
Having reached man's estate he married Miss Catharine McNair, and they 
became parents of eight children. Both were Presbyterians in their re- 
ligious belief, and Mr. Jardine died in his forty- fourth year, while his wife 
passed away in her fifty-fourth year, their remains being interred in their 
native town of Campbleton, New Brunswick. 

Robert Jardine was educated in the public schools of that place and 
entered upon his business career in the railroad service, as freight agent with 
the Intercolonial Railway, acting in that capacity for eight years in Camp- 
bleton, after which he was engaged in general merchandising for two years. 
He then came to New Westminster, accepting a position in the office of the 
British Columbia Mills, Timber &amp; Trading Company. In i8q2 he was 
promoted to the position of manager of the Royal City Mills, and since that 
time has given close and unremitting attention to the business. 

The British Columbia Mills, Timber &amp; Trading Company has its head- 
quarters in Vancouver. John Hendry is the president and Richard H. Alex- 
ander the secretary and treasurer. Theirs is by far the largest lumbering 
manufacturing enterprise in the province or in Canada. The Royal City 
Mills, located at New Westminster, were established in 1878. Later the 
firm of Hendry, McNair &amp; Company became owners and built the Royal 
City Planing Mills. A more extended history of this company and its ex- 
tensive operations is given in connection with the sketch of Mr. Hendry on 
another page of this work. The mills in New Westminster have a capacity 
of sixty thousand feet of lumber every ten hours, and one hundred and 
twenty-five thousand shingles in the same time, while the sash and door 
factory has a capacity of from three to five hundred doors. They manu- 
facture all kinds of house finishings and also boxes. Two of the company's 
steamers are used in transporting for this branch of business, their own tugs 
are used to bring the logs to the mill, and about two hundred and ninety 
men are here employed, so that the supervision of the business demands 
marked energy and capability — qualities with which Mr. Jardine is well 
equipped. He has the entire confidence of those whom he represents, for 



688 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

he has so managed the mills at this point as to make them a gratifying 
source of profit to the stockholders of the company. 

Mr. Jardine takes an active interest in the affairs of the town in which 
he resides and in the politics of the country, and adheres to the Liberal party. 
He is an active member of the Board of Trade of New Westminster and 
he belongs to Union Lodge No. 9, A. F. &amp; A. M., also Westminster Chapter, 
R. A. M. 

In 1890 Mr. Jardine was united in marriage to Miss A. C. Campbell, 
a native of Maria, Quebec. After several years of happy married life the 
wife was called from her home by death, passing away in 1897. She left 
two daughters, Jean and Katie. A wide circle of friends held her in high 
esteem, for in her life she portrayed many sterling qualities of heart and 
mind. Mr. Jardine and his family occupied a nice home in Westminster, and 
he sustains a very enviable reputation as a reliable and capable business 
man. 

SAMUEL M. BRYDGES. 

Samuel M. Brydges, who has been a resident of Nelson during the past 
eight years, came to this city from Brandon, Manitoba, and is now num- 
bered among its prominent business men. Here he is largely interested in 
the real estate business and mining, and although he started upon his busi- 
ness career without capital he has accumulated good real estate and built up 
an extensive insurance business here. He has also been instrumental in 
interesting outside capital, principally in Nelson- realty, and is secretary of 
the Nelson Board of Trade. He is a young man of thirty-one years, but he 
possesses laudable ambition and is making for himself a name and position 
in the business world. 

THOMAS L. BRIGGS. 

Thomas L. Briggs, of New Westminster, is numbered among the pio- 
neers of British Columbia of 1862. Great have been the changes that have 
occurred in that time, in fact, the growth of the country and its improvement 
have been so marvelous as to partake almost of the magical. Deserving of 
much credit for his co-operation in the work of development and upbuilding, 
Mr. Briggs certainly deserves representation among the pioneer citizens and 
representatl v^e men of the province. He figured prominently in business af- 
fairs and gave tangible support to every measure that fostered public improve-

A native of Kingston, Canada, Mr. Briggs was born on the 29th of 
March, 1839. His grandfather, Thomas Briggs, was a native of England,

in which country he spent the days of his boyhood and youth and following 
his marriage he crossed the ocean to Canada in 1829. Thomas Briggs, Jr., 
father of Thomas L. Briggs, was born in England and accompanied his par- 
ents on their emigration to the new world, the family becoming pioneer resi- 
dents of Ontario, Canada. Having arrived at years of maturity Thomas 
Briggs, Jr., married Miss Cynthia Lasher, also a native of England. For 
many years he was actively associated with business interests in Kingston and 
he died in the ninetieth year of his age, while his wife passed away at the 
age of sixty years, their remains being interred in the Kingston cemetery. 
They were members of the Church of England ami were people of the highest 
respectability. In their family were six sons, three of them being in Brit- 
ish Columbia, Albert and Alfred being residents of Victoria. 

Thomas L. Briggs, now well known in Westminster and indeed in other 
parts of the province, was a student in Queens College and completed his 
course in a Church of England grammar school. He served an apprentice- 
ship of five years in London to the hardware business and the excitement 
caused by the discovery of gold on the Eraser river brought him to British 
Columbia in 1862. He made his way direct to New Westminster and went 
to the Cariboo mines, walking there and teck with a heavy pick upon his 
shoulders, thus covering a distance of six hundred miles. Prices at that time 
were very high, flour bringing a dollar and half per pound, while other things 
sold at a proportionate rate. On reaching his destination Mr. Briggs tried 
mining, but did not rapidly realize the fortune that he hoped to gain and ac- 
cordingly returned to Westminster. There he entered the services of Bar- 
nard's Express, conveying express fiT)m Douglas to Lillooet, a distance of one 
hundred and fifty miles by stage. He was engaged in that business for about 
a month and then returned to Westminster, after which he secured employ- 
ment in the forwarding house of Smith &amp; Company, becoming actively en- 
gaged in forwarding goods and collecting freight. This continued until the 
spring of 1864, when he went to Cariboo to close out a branch business that 
the company had established there. At Cariboo he entered the employ of 
Scott Packer, a forwarder, and when the business was closed out he purchased 
the balance of the stock and continued in the trade, carrying on the enterprise 
on his own account for about six years, during which time he met with a fair 
measure of success. He was also agent for the wholesale business of Greeley 
&amp; Fitierre and handled large consignments for them. He also became largely 
interested in mining operations, becoming one of the owners of the Forest 
Rise and other claims on Williams creek, the Red Gulch, Victoria and Lohee 
creek. He likewise had an interest in still other claims, which yielded a good 



690 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

return. He was thus closely associated with the early development of the 
country, aiding in reclaiming the wild districts for the purposes of civiHza- 
tion of its natural resources for the benefit of man. 

In 1872 Mr. Briggs returned to Kingston to visit his relatives', from 
whom he had been separated for ten years. In 1873 he went to Chicago and 
on learning of the building of the Canadian Pacific Railroad to the Pacific 
coast he returned to Victoria, anticipating the great development and growth 
of this section of the country. In Victoria he engaged in business with D. 
Curtz, who afterward went to the Cariboo district, Mr. Briggs forwarding 
him stock from Victoria. "They conducted the business for two years and 
then sold out. In 1874 Mr. Briggs took a stock of goods to the Cassiar mines, 
but decided not to go into business there, so sold his stock at a good advantage 
and returned to Victoria. In 1875 in Victoria he embarked in the wholesale 
dry goods business under the firm style of Strass, Briggs, Curtz &amp; Company. 
This relationship was maintained for four years. The railroad, however, 
had not yet been built and Mr. Briggs sold his interest to his partners and en- 
gaged in steam-boating in connection with Captain John Irving. They oper- 
ated the pioneer line on the Fraser river, going- as far up the stream as Yale. 
After two years they united their interests with the Hudson's Bay Company. 
The Canadian Pacific Navigation Company operated from Victoria to Yale, 
using seven boats on the line, and Mr. Briggs became the agent for the com- 
pany at New Westrninster. In 1900 they sold out to the Canadian Pacific 
Railroad Company and Mr. Briggs has since been retired from active business. 
Under his management the business continually grew and was eminently suc- 
cessful. He likewise made judicious investment in lands in Alberta, which 
also proved a profitable source of income and he still has several thousand 
acres there and is also a prominent property holder in New Westminster. 

In 1874 Mr. Briggs was married to Miss Mary Irving, a daughter of 
Captain John Irving and a sister of Captain John Irving, Jr. Mrs. Briggs 
is a native of the state of Oregon and by her marriage she has become the 
mother of nine children, all of whom were born in British Columbia and are 
still residing there. Their children are William Irving, Henry C, Beryl D., 
John A., Stanley K., Manuella, Naomi, Octavia and Errol. The family are 
Presbyterians in religious belief and they have a delightful home in this city and 
are among its most highly esteemed residents. To give in detail the history of 
Mr. Briggs and his varied experiences would be to present a complete picture 
of British Columbia in pioneer times and to indicate much of the progress 
of its development. He has gained through the varied experiences which come 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 691 

to the early settlers, has kept in touch with the business growth and substan- 
tial improvement of the progress and at all times has endorsed those measures 
and movements which he believed would contribute to general prosperity. 

WILLIAM HAROLD MALKIN. 

William Harold Malkin, as a member of the Board of Trade, of which 
he was at one time president, and as a wholesale grocer of Vancouver, is 
prominent in the business circles and public life of Vancouver. He belongs 
to that class of representative men who have been the real promoters and 
upbuilders of the city, through the institution and conduct of extensive com- 
mercial and industrial enterprises that have promoted commercial prosperity. 

William Harold Malkin Avas born at Burslem, Staffordshire, England, 
July 30, 1868, the fifth son in a family of six sons and three daughters, all 
of whom grew up to years of maturity, with the exception of one sister. 
His parents and grandfathers were natives of the same place, and were 
identified for many years with all its religious, philanthropic, and commer- 
cial activities. His father, James Malkin, was a member of the firm of 
Edge, Malkin &amp; Company, earthenware and tile manufacturers, having mar- 
ried Ann Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Joseph Edge, the head of the 
firm. At the death of her husband Mrs. Malkin left England in 1895 to 
reside in Vancouver, where three unmarried sons, W. Harold, James Fred- 
eric and John Philip Davey, had preceded her, and she still (1905) con- 
tinues to make it her home. 

William Harold Malkin was educated at the High School, Newcastle- 
under-Lyme, Staffordshire, the head rhaster of which was Mr. Kitchener, 
cousin of the famous soldier, Lord Kitchener. As a master at Rugby, under 
Dr. Temple, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, Mr. Kitchener suc- 
ceeded to the traditions of the famous Dr. Arnold, and he brought to New- 
castle the same spirit of enthusiasm, in the work of moral and intellectual 
education, which had distinguished that man. In 1884 William Harold 
Malkin came to Canada with his elder brother, Frederic, who took up 
land and farmed at Grenfell, Assinaboia, for several years. After some ex- 
perience in agriculture in the Northwest, and in connection with the firm 
of Sherlock &amp; Freeman, general merchants, Grenfell, W. H. Malkin became 
manager for O. P. Skrine, in the same business. In 1894 this firm removed 
to Vancouver; there he entered into partnership with Mr. Skrine. After 
two years he purchased his partner's interest in the business, and when he 
had conducted it alone for two years he incorporated the business under the 
name of The W. H. Malkin Company, Limited. His brothers are his part- 



0J)2 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ners, and the business has kept pace with the phenomenal growth of the city. 
It is conckicted along thoroughly honorable business principles, and the 
brothers give their individual attention to the enterprise, carefully superin- 
tending every department. The reputation which the house sustains is unas- 
sailable, for they have closely followed a high standard of commercial ethics. 
They have a fine large store on Water street, and carry a large stock of 
groceries and provisions ; they employ thirty employes to meet the demands 
of- the trade, which is constantly growing in volume and importance, and 
they have a large wholesale trade throughout the Northwest and the Yukon 
territory. 

Since coming to Vancouver, Mr. Malkin has ranked with the leading 
business men of the city, and was at one time president of the Board of 
Trade. He filled the office in a manner highly satisfactory to the members, 
creditable to himself and l&gt;eneficial to the city. He is also a director of the 
British Columbia Permanent Loan &amp; Saving Company, an institution which 
has been wonderfully successful since its incorporation seven years ago. 

In April, 1901, Mr. Malkin was happily married to Miss Marion Dougall, 
fifth daughter of Francis James Dougall, of Windsor, Ontario. They have 
one son, Harold Richardson, and one daughter, Lila Marion. They are 
members of the Methodist church, and Mr. Malkin is identified with the 
quarterly board. Coming to Canada when a youth of sixteen, he has never 
had occasion to regret leaving his native country* for here he has worked 
his way upward, gaining not only most gratifying success in the business 
world, but also the good will, confidence and regard of many friends. 

ALEXANDER MUNRO. 

Alexander Munro is a Scotchman, born in Ross-shire, Scotland, in the 
year 1824. In 1850, after having served for a number of years in offices 
in his native county, he went to London as clerk in a bank, and remained 
there nearly seven years. In 1857, under agreement to go out to Vancouver's 
Island, he left London in February and reached Victoria on the 7th of May 
in that year. For the first few years he was accountant and general over- 
seer in Vancouver's Island for the Puget Sound Agricultural Company (an 
offshoot from the Hudson's Bay Company), who had several large farms 
and establishments in full operation in Esquimault District, adjoining the 
District of Victoria. Afterwards he took up his residence in Victoria, and 
became accountant there for the Hudson's Bay Company's western depart- 
ment, which comprised the whole of what is now known as the province of 
British Columbia, continuing also his charge of the Puget Sound Agricul- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 698 

tnral Company's affairs. At that time and for many years subsequently the 
Hudson's Bay Company's extensive business throughout the western de- 
partment was conducted from Victoria by a board of management, consist- 
ing usually of two and sometimes three chief factors. The goods required 
for the trade of the country were brought from London to Victoria around 
Cape Horn yearly in the company's ships, the same ships taking to London 
return cargoes of furs and other products from the many outlying posts, 
all of which had been collected at Victoria as the depot, and there prepared 
for shipment ; while the " Brigades," on their return to the interior, took 
with them by various modes of conveyance, such as boats, canoes, horse, 
mule and ox trains, etc., the goods which had been prepared at Victoria for 
the several districts. Those were busy years and called for strenuous effort, 
especially at certain seasons. Besides the fur trade there was an increasing 
commercial and shipping business carried on at Victoria. 

In 1872 Mr. Munro obtained his commission as a factor in the Hudson's 
Bay Company's- service, and in 1874 his commission as a chief factor, charged 
with the leasing and selling of the company's lands in and around Victoria 
and Esquimault on Vancouver's Island and at Langley and other places on 
the mainland, until 1890, when he retired from the service, enjoying the 
confidence and good will of the governing board in London and their repre- 
sentatives in British Columbia, etc. 

In 1862 he built the dwelling house in Victoria which he and Mrs. 
Munro still occupy, now known as No. 6 Michigan street. Victoria was 
then but a small town. In the James Bay quarter, southward between his 
site and the Straits of Fuca, there were only two or three buildings of any 
kind, one of them being a farm house of the company, and the other owned 
and occupied by one of the company's officers. 

Mr. and Mrs. Munro were married in Scotland on the ist of November, 
i860, and they have reared a family of three girls and four boys, all now liv- 
ing, and grown up years ago. 

HON. FORBES GEORGE VERNON. 

Hon. F. G. Vernon, a pioneer citizen, prominent man of affairs and for 
a number of years intimately identified with the administrative policies of 
the province, has lived in British Columbia since 1863, ^"*^ ^^ now a well 
known resident of Victoria, where he has large interests. 

Mr. Vernon is a native of Ireland and was born near Dublin, at Clon- 
tarf Castle, on August 21, 1843. He is descended from an old and illus- 
trious family of Ireland. The earliest ancestors founded the town of Ver- 



694 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

non in Normandy, and followed William the Conqueror into England. About 
the fifteenth century some of them crossed the channel into Ireland and set- 
tled at Clontarf. In this vicinity some large estates came into the possession 
of the Vernons, which still remain in their ownership. It was on this an- 
cestral demesne, inherited by his father and now owned by his elder brother, 
Colonel Edward Vernon, D. L., that Mr. F. G. Vernon was brought up. 
He was educated in England for the Royal Engineers, eventually receiving 
a commission in the Twenty-first Fusileers, but resigned it the same year 
it w^as granted, 1863, and in company with his brother Charles A. and 
Colonel Houghton, took passage for New York, and from there to Aspin- 
wall, Panama, and San Francisco, arriving in due course at Esquimault. 
The party settled finally in the Yale district and engaged in stock-raising, 
mining and merchandising. Colonel Houghton sold his interests to the 
brothers in 1873, and later on Mr. F. G. Vernon purchased the interests of 
his brothers. He immediately increased his possessions from three thousand 
to thirteen thousand acres, imported blooded cattle and engaged in farming 
on an extensive scale. 

In 1875 began Mr. Vernon's public career by his election to the provin- 
cial legislature as a representative from Yale, being returned by a large 
majority. In February, 1876, he accepted the portfolio of chief commissioner 
of lands and works in the Elliot cabinet, and on seeking confirmation in 
this ofiice by the votes of the people he was re-elected by an overwhelming 
majority, and the confidence thus plainly manifested in his ability and in- 
tegrity was never misplaced during his long legislative and administrative 
career. He retained this position in the cabinet until the general election 
of 1878, when he was again returned to the legislature by his constituency. 
But in consequence of the defeat of the Elliot ministry about that time, dur- 
ing the remainder of this term he sat among the opposition. In 1882 he 
was not a candidate, but in 1886 was again elected, and in 1887, on the 
death of Hon. Mr. Smythe, he accepted the vacant office in the Davie cabinet 
as chief commissioner of lands and works. In June, 1890, he was again 
sent up by his constituency, and continued to hold his ministerial office 
during the premiership of Hon. John Robson and of Hon. Theodore Davie, 
filling the position most acceptably until 1894. During his long official 
career he proved himself one of the most capable and public-spirited men 
ever chosen to office by the people of this province, and the affairs of his 
department notably prospered throughout his terms. For four years, 1895 
to 1899, he resided in Lxindon, England, as agent general for the province 
of British Columbia, holding that position until the office was abolished.

Mr. Vernon is now retired from political life, and during recent years has 
disposed of his large holdings in the interior of the country, investing largely 
in real estate and buildings in Victoria and on the mainland. 

In 1877 Mr. Vernon married Miss Branks, by whom he had two chil- 
dren, the daughter, Miss Beatrice, being the only survivor. The death of 
Mrs. Vernon occurred in 1884. The prosperous town of Vernon, popula- 
tion two thousand, takes its name from the_ subject of our sketch. 

JAMES LEAMY. 

James Leamy is the crown timber agent at New Westminster and for 
the past quarter of a century has been a leading contractor and engineer in 
British Columbia. He has been identified with the construction of various 
railroad lines and with other enterprises which have increased the indus- 
trial wealth and resources of the province. 

Mr. Leamy was born in 1848, in Hull, at the mouth of the Gatineau 
river, Quebec, being a son of Andrew and Erezina (Wright) Leamy. His 
mother's grandfather, Philomen Wright, Sr., was the pioneer who first set- 
tled at Hull, having come there from Woburn, Massachusetts, during the 
migration of the loyalists from the colonies. Andrew Leamy, the father, was 
a prominent lumberman on the Ottawa river. He owned and operated the 
first steam sawmill in that vicinity, located on what is known as Leamy's 
Lake, two miles and a half from the city of Ottawa. Mr. Leamy's maternal 
uncle, Alonzo Wright, was ordinarily known as the "King of the Gatineau," 
and for nearly forty years represented the county of Ottawa in the Canadian 
Hcuse of Commons. 

Mr. Leamy obtained his education in the Jesuit college at Montreal and 
at Ottawa College. After his graduation from the latter institution he went 
into the lumber business with his father, and continued that line of activity 
until the latter's death. He then beg^in railway construction, building a 
part of the Q. and M. O. &amp; O. road, which is now a part of the Canadian 
Pacific. He came to British Columbia in 1880 and began work on the Pacific 
division of the Canadian Pacific, in the Onderdonk contracts, at Yale. He 
was assistant superintendent of construction under E. Tilton and later under 
M. J. Haney until the road was completed. In the fall of 1885 he moved 
to New Westminster, and went into the contracting business in company 
with D. McGillivray, building the branch line into New Westminster and 
other works. In company with George F. Kyle, he built a sawmill on False 
creek, and continued its operation until 1894. Other of Mr. Leamy's works 
in British Columbia was the building of a branch line from New Westmin- 



696 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ster Junction to New Westminster, the building of the New Westminster 
&amp; Southern, and the WilHams Head Quarantine Station wharves. He and 
D. McGillivray built the bridges on the line from Port Moody to Vancouver, 
also the first extension to the Canadian Pacific wharf at Vancouver. He 
then built the New Westminster and Southern Railway, which extends from 
the boundary line of British Columbia to Blaine, Washington. In 1897 
Mr. Leamy was appointed crown timber agent for the Dominion govern- 
ment, being given charge over the timber in the Dominion railway belt in 
British Columbia, an office of responsibility and trust which he has capably 
filled to the present time. 

Mr. Leamy is president of the New Westminster Club, and is affiliated 
with the Masonic order. He married Miss Annie Quigg of Aylmer, Quebec, 
a daughter of Charles Quigg. Four sons and four daughters have been 
born, namely, Charles L., Erezina, who is the wife of J. H. Diamond, Albert 
J., Lila. Harold, Alma, Hubert and Veda. Mr. Leamy is an enthusiast 
on the national game of Lacrosse, and was the first president of the British 
Columbia Amateur Lacrosse Association, and has always taken an active 
interest in the sport. 

THOMAS JAMES SKINNER. 

Thomas James Skinner, by whose death the province of British Colum- 
bia lost one of its oldest pioneer citizens, was among the first to begin to 
develop the province. He was much experienced in the ways and affairs of 
the world, and had been in various parts of the world. A native of Essex, 
England, in early life he joined the East India Company's service and made 
several voyages to India. Leaving that service he resided for some time 
on his father's property and engaged in farming, which he continued until 
1852. In that year he left England and made the voyage around Cape Horn 
to British Columbia, where he arrived in 1853, on the sailing vessel Norman 
Morrison. He entered the employ of the Puget Sound Agricultural So- 
ciety, and was located at Esquimault, where he engaged in farming. In con- 
nection with Mr. McKenzie and others he also held the contract for supply- 
ing the navy with l^eef and vegetables. In 1866 he moved to the Cowichan 
district, and was one of the first to acquire land in that locality. He con- 
tinued his farming operations to the time of his death. He was a leader in 
the community, and was one of the members elected to the first legislature 
in the province. 

His wife was Mary Lowdham Goode, who. became the mother of eight 
children, one of whom died in England, and those living at the present 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 69T 

writing are: Robert J., who adopted a mercantile career and was in charge 
of the Hudson's Bay post at Ouesnelle. He was a member of the legislature 
of British Columbia for the Kootenay district and assisted in advancing 
the confederation of the province with the Dominion of Canada. On leaving 
the Hudson's Bay Company Mr. .Skinner received the appointment of timber 
inspector for the province, which office he now holds. Ernest M., a civil 
engineer at Duncans, mentioned below; Annie, wife of John Brenner, of 
the Royal Navy ; Mary, who lives with her brother Ernest at Duncans ; Ada, 
the wife of John Stevenson, of Cariboo; and Emily. 

Ernest M. Skinner was bom in Essex, England, April 26, 1847, and 
was brought to British Columbia as a child, his education being received in 
the Hudson's Bay Company's school and then in the collegiate school in 
Victoria. He was employed on the home farm, and by actual experience 
in the field he became a practical surveyor and civil engineer, which self- 
acquired profession he has since continued with large success. He has 
large mining interests, and has a small dairy and fruit farm about four 
miles from Dtmcans. He is a Conservative in politics, and is a member of 
the Church of England. His fraternal affiliations are with the Ancient 
Order of United Workmen. 

GEORGE W. CAMPBELL. 

George W. Campbell, manager of the Rat Portage Lumber Company 
at Vancouver, is classed with the most enterprising and successful business 
men of this section of the country, being in control of one of the large 
productive industries of the province. The business development of British 
Columbia has been so rapid and its condition so constantly changing that it 
has been the men of marked discernment and unfaltering diligence who have 
been able to cope with intricate business conditions and so shaped them to 
their own ends as to win success that is at once creditable and gratifying. 
George W. Campbell, possessing the full confidence of the business com- 
munity, is in control of one of the leading lumber interests of Vancouver. 

Born in the town of Maria in the province of Quebec, on the 13th 
of June, i860, he is of Scotch ancestry. His grandfather, Peter Campbell, 
was born in Scotland and emigrated to Summerside, Prince Edward's Island, 
at an early day. There the father of our subject was born in the year 1816, 
and having, arrived at years of maturity he married Miss Jane Tourgis, 
a native of the Isle of Jersey. Early in his business life he secured the 
island of Anta Costa in the Gulf of St. Lawrence for a hunting preserve, but 
later in life he met with an accident that caused him the loss of one of his 



698 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

lower limbs and this incapacitated him for that enterprise. He then turned 
his attention to commercial interests and was proprietor of a general stc&gt;re 
in Maria. He also became engaged in lumbering and in the fishing business 
there. Thus his activity reached out to several fields of endeavor, wherein 
capable management brought him desirable prosperity. He is now living 
retired in the ninetieth year of his age and is splendidly preserved both 
physically and mentally. His wife, who has long traveled life's journey with 
him, is now in her seventy-third year. They are Presbyterians in religious 
faith and have so lived as to command the esteem and good will of all with 
whom they have been associated. They became the parents of five children, 
three of whom are now living, namely : E. T. Campbell, who is engaged 
in the lumbering business with his brother in Vancouver ; George W. ; and 
Mrs. G. B. Baker, also a resident of Vancouver. 

George W. Campbell acquired his early education in New Brunswick, 
and after putting aside his text books became connected with the lumber 
and canning industries in his native town, following in the footsteps of his 
father in this particular. They owned two canneries there and Mr. Camp- 
bell continued his identification with commercial and industrial interests in 
Maria until his removal to Vancouver in 1885. Where is now seen a popu- 
lous city with every modern advantage and improvement and with large 
business enterprises was then a dense forest, only a few houses having been 
built, while the little hamlet gave no promise of the splendid development 
which the future had in store for it. Here Mr. Campbell became connected 
with the lumber trade, his present experience well fitting him for his opera- 
tions here. He was with the British Columbia Mills, Timber &amp; Trading 
Company for fifteen years and left that company to take charge of the Rat 
Portage Mills at Vancouver, being now actively engaged in the management 
of this extensive plant. The mill was built by W. L. Tait in 1900 and was 
purchased by the Rat Portage Lumber Company in 1903, having at that 
time a capacity of forty thousand feet of lumber in ten hours. The Rat 
Portage Lumber Company at once made very extensive improvements, using 
new and modern machinery and increasing the facilities until it now has 
the capacity of ninety thousand feet of lumber in ten hours. Employment 
is furnished to a large number of men, and there is one five hundred horse 
power engine, another of eighty horse power and two of fifty horse power. 
The plant is equipped with five planers and the dry kiln is thirty by one 
hundred and twenty feet, holding five carloads. of lumber. The company 
owns six thousand acres of timber on the coast, from which they obtain 
their logs and in connection with the sawmill they have a shingle mill with 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 699 

a capacity of fifty tfiousand cedar shingles per day. The plant at Vancouver 
is but a branch of the property of this character owned by the Rat Portage 
Lumber Company, Limited. The officers of the company are D. C. Cameron, 
president, with headquarters in Winnipeg; Mr. Monk, manager of the Ot- 
tawa Bank in Winnipeg, as one of the directors; William Robertson, gen- 
eral secretary; and J. E. Young, cashier. The company owns a large mill 
at Winnipeg, one at Riny river and a third at Rat Portage, and in addition 
to the mills at Vancouver the company is erecting a large new mill at Har- 
rison river, which when completed will be one of the best equipped mills 
on the Pacific coast, while the aggregate capacity will be about six hundred 
thousand feet of lumber in ten hours. Employment is furnished to more 
than two thousand men. Mr. Campbell, in control of the business in Van- 
couver, shows a thorough knowledge of the lum1&gt;er trade and of the best 
methods of converting the rough logs into the finished and marketable prod- 
uct, and is one of the trusted representatives of a leading corporation, his 
capability and thorough understanding of the trade enabling him to fill an 
important and lucrative position. 

Mr, Campbell was married in 1893 to Miss Alexine Patterson, a native 
of Winnipeg and a daughter of A. Patterson of that city. This union is 
blessed with a son and daughter, Wetsford and Isabella. Theirs is one of 
the nice residences of Vancouver. Mrs. Campbell is a member of the Pres- 
byterian church and they are both widely and favorably known in the city 
in which Mr. Campbell has resided from pioneer times to the present. 

JOHN CHAPMAN DAVIE, M. D. 

Dr. John Chapman Davie, one of Victoria's pioneer citizens, whose dis- 
tinguished ability in the line of his profession has won him notable success, 
was born in Wells, Somersetshire, England, on the 22d of March, 1845, 
and is a representative of old families in that country. His father, the Hon. 
John Chapman Davie, M. R. C. S., L. S. A., who practiced his profession 
in Merton, Surrey, England, came to British Columbia in 1862, accompanied 
by his four sons. He continued in the active practice of medicine in Victoria 
and also became a prominent and influential factor in pubjic affairs, serving 
at one time as a member of the local legislature before the confederation. 
He married Miss Annie Collard Waldron, a representative of an old family 
of Wellington, Somersetshire, England, who departed this life in 1866, in 
the fifty-fourth year of her age. One of her sons, Hon. Alexander Edmund 
Batson Davie, became a very prominent member of the bar of British Co- 
lumbia and occupied the high office of premier of the province. Another son, 



700 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Hon. Theodore Davie, also became premier of the province of British Co- 
kimbia, and afterward chief justice of the province. The third son, Will- 
iam, has extensive agricultural interests. The father died in 1867, in the 
fifty-sixth year of his age. 

Dr. John Chapman Davie completed his literary education in Silcoates 
College of England and prepared for his profession in the University of 
San Francisco, in California. He spent three years there, during which 
time he attended the lectures of Dr. H. H. Toland and Dr. L. C. Lane, both 
of whom enjoyed continental reputations and later became distinguished as 
the founders of colleges. 

After completing his university course Dr. Davie returned to Victoria 
and entered upon the practice of his profession in connection with his father, 
benefiting by his ripe ex;[&gt;erience. He has since remained in active practice 
in Victoria. He is a member of the Provincial Medical Council, of which he 
has had the honor of- being president. 

In 1867 Dr. Davie was married to Miss Kate Thain, of Victoria, and 
unto them were born three daughters, as follows : Isabella, now the wife 
of Dr. R. W. Craig, of Phoenix, Arizona; Edith, who resides with her 
father; and Kate, who is now Mrs. Polehampton, and makes her home in 
England. Mrs. Davie departed this life in 1882, and the Doctor has since 
remained single. In politics he is a Conservative. He belongs to the Inde- 
.pendent Order of Odd Fellows and to the Church of England. 

EDWIN CATON MAHONY. 

Edwin Caton Mahony, manager of the Royal City Planing Mills, Van- 
couver, British Columbia, a branch of the British • Columbia Mills, Timber 
&amp; Trading Company, is connected with one of the most important indus- 
trial concerns of the great west. To the energetic natures and strong men- 
tality of such men this portion of Canada owes its marvelous development. 
His life has been one of continuous activity, in which has been accorded due 
recognition of labor, and today he is numbered among the substantial citizens 
of Vancouver. His interests are thoroughly identified with those of the 
west, and at all times he is ready to lend his aid and co-operation to any 
movement calculated to benefit this section of the country, or to promote its 
wonderful growth. 

Mr. Mahony was born in the. city of Hamilton, Ontario, on the 14th 
of December, 1864, and is of Irish lineage. His paternal grandfather was 
born in the county of Wexford, Ireland, and at' an early date emigrated to 
the new world, settling in Quebec. John C. Mahony, father of Edwin C. 



\' I 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 701 

Mahony, was iDorn in the ancient capital of that province, and after arriv- 
ing at years of maturity wedded Miss Hannah Sarah Gage, a native of the 
city of Hamilton, Ontario, and a daughter of the late Peter Gage, a farmer 
and prominent citizen of the county of Wentworth. He was descended from 
one of the famous United Empire Loyalists, and his family was one of 
the best known throughout the whole of the Niagara peninsula. Mrs. Gage 
lived to the advanced age of ninety, and died only a few years ago. John 
C. Mahony became a boot and shoe manufacturer, carrying on business along 
that line in Hamilton for many years. He died in the fifty-eighth year of 
his age, and six months before his wife departed this life, aged fifty-two. 
The two children of this marriage were Mrs. John Bradley, who resides in 
New York, and the subject of this sketch. 

In the public schools of Hamilton Edwin C. Mahony began his edu- 
cation, which was continued in the Collegiate Institute there, and later he 
graduated from the Ontario Agricultural College, of which Dr. Mills, now 
a member of the Railway Commission, was the president. Later Mr. Mahony 
pursued a course of study in the Canada Business College, and thus was 
well equipped for life's practical and responsible duties. In 1880 he settled 
upon the Peter Gage homestead, situated near the famous battlefield of 
Stoney Creek. He was very devoted to pastoral life, his course of study 
in the Agricultural College having thoroughly fitted him for scientific farm- 
ing, and he was an enthusiast upon that subject. 

At the end of six years, however, he was induced by his brother-in- 
law, John Bradley, to abandon agricultural pursuits, and at his invitation 
first engaged in the lumber industry, becoming an employee of the firm of 
Messrs. Flatt &amp; Bradley, who were in the lumber business at the town of 
Casselman, on the Canada Atlantic Railway, a short distance from Ottawa. 
From assistant log scaler he gradually worked upward, mastering every part 
of the business. He remained there until the fall of 1889, and had risen 
successively until he was yard foreman, and later had charge of the planing 
mill department. Realizing* that the lumber industry in the west offered 
greater inducements and that the country had splendid prospects before it, 
he decided to go to British Columbia, and in April, 1890, arrived in New 
Westminster. He appreciated the fact that conditions existing in the east 
varied from those in the west, and accordingly set to work to thoroughly 
learn the different methods. His first work was wheeling a truck in the 
yard of the Royal City Planing Mills, the New Westminster branch of the 
British Columbia Mills, Timber &amp; Trading Company. His capability and 
fiddity soon won recognition, and he has found in each transition stage in 



T02 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

his business career a wider outlook and broader scope for accomplishment.' 
He was soon made a tally man. He gave undivided attention to the busi- 
ness of the company, and after eight months' service was chosen as successor 
to the yard foreman. In August, 1891, it was decided by the general man- 
agement of the company to inaugurate a local and car department in con- 
nection with its leading establishment known as the Hastings Mill branch, 
Vancouver, operations previously at this mill having been directed exclu- 
sively to the foreign trade, and Mr. Mahony was transferred to the head 
offices to carry out the contemplated change, made necessary by developing 
conditions. At that time all of the local business of the company passed 
through his department, and he was occupying the responsible position of 
yard superintendent of the local and car department of this branch of the 
company when the plant was destroyed by fire in 1898. At that time the 
newly discovered mining district of Atlin was attracting considerable atten- 
tion, and during the time of the reconstruction of the mill he secured leave 
of absence for that interval. Accepting the offer of government service, 
he went north and was the first postmaster of the new town of Atlin. He 
afterward resumed his former position at the Hastings Mill, and shortly 
after was appointed to the managership of the Royal City Saw and Planing 
Mills, a branch establishment of the company in Vancouver. He first de- 
voted himself to the reorganization of the methods practiced, carrying out 
ideas in the conduct of the different departments that resulted in its being 
changed from one of the heaviest risks of fire insurance companies to the 
lowest rate of its kind in British Columbia, and in the plant becoming one of 
the model establishments on the Pacific Coast. 

It was about this time that Mr. Mahony turned his attention to the 
utilization of the by-product of the mill, and the successful accomplishment 
of this, after months of thoughtful consideration and many experiments, 
brought him into a prominent place among the manufacturers of the west. 
This feature eventually developed into the construction of "ready-made" 
houses, the first specimens of which aroused the most favorable comment. 
This department of the company's business was first started with the idea 
of making some use of the odd stock, and after ceaseless work it has attained 
a success far beyond the original expectations of the inventor and the com- 
pany. It was the evolution of an idea, and the finished product of today 
furnishes a slight indication of the indefatigable assiduity necessary for the 
development of his originality. 

The company has some splendid designs for tasteful and attractive 
architecture in their four to ten roomed houses. All parts of construction, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA T03 

which are protected by letters patent, are manufactured at the mill and 
shipped to wherever ordered. Working or key plans are furnished, show- 
ing in detail the methods employed in erecting these buildings, and thus 
aided any man can very easily erect his own dwelling. Enabled in this way. 
to put the parts together himself, the purchaser effects a great saving in the 
cost of construction. Mr. Mahony's long connection with the business and 
his familiarity with every detail as well as its principal iroints have made him 
an expert, and he has developed a very large trade in this branch of ready- 
made houses. His own residence, in a delightful section of the city, where 
it commands a view of a beautiful expanse of sea, is an example of the per- 
fection to which this modern method of construction has been brought. It 
is attractive, unique and handsome, and shows that individuality of taste 
has the fullest scope. 

In 1891 he was married to Miss Clara Hill, of Smithville, Ontario, the 
daughter of Nathaniel Hill, who resides with them. Her parents came to 
British Columbia in 1892, her mother departing this life in 1899. Mr. and 
Mrs. Mahony have two daughters, both born in Vancouver, Edna and Ida. 
The family are Methodists in religious faith, and Mr. Mahony is a staunch 
Mason, being a member of the Blue, Royal Arch and Knight Templar de- 
grees. Imbued with laudable ambition to attain success, he has steadily ad- 
vanced in those walks of life demanding intellectuality, business ability and 
fidelity, and today stands as one of the leading representatives of industrial 
interests in his adopted city, commanding the respect and esteem not only 
of his immediate community, but of the people throughout the province and 
wherever he is known. 

ROBERT SCOTT LENNIE. 

Robert Scott Lennie is a member of the firm of Elliot and Lennie, bar- 
risters and solicitors. 

Mr. Lennie was born in Smith's Falls, Ontario, August 16, 1875, ^^^ 
is a son of the Rev. Robert and Catherine (Harcus) Lennie, who are resi- 
dents of New Westminster, British Columbia. The father was for many 
years a clergyman of the Baptist church, but is now living retired from the 
active work of the ministry. He was only six years of age at the time of 
his parents' removal to this province, the family home being established in 
New Westminster. He took up the study of law under the direction of 
Thomas Clive Atkinson, then the police magistrate of New Westminster. In 
Jcinuary, 1898, he was admitted to the bar and entered upon practice in Nel- 



704 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

son in connection with John ElHot, a relation that has since been main- 
tained. 

On the 19th of October, 1898, Mr. Lennie was married to Miss Edith 
Louise DtDuglas. a daughter of Benjamin Douglas of New Westminister, 
and they have three children : Robert Douglas, Gerald Scott and Edith 
Beatrice Catharine. 

JOHN ELLIOT. 

John Elliot, prominent representative of the British Columbia bar, 
having acted as the legal counsel for many interests since his location in the 
city of Nelson in 1892, and a public-spirited citizen and able factor in all 
undertakings to which he has given his attention, was born in 1865, in Exeter, 
Ontario. He is a son of Benjamin V. and Jane (Giffard) Elliot, who were 
lx)rn in Plymouth, England, and in early life emigrated to Canada. 

Mr. Elliot received his early education in the local public schools, and 
graduated from Upper Canada College in 1881. He then" entered the fa- 
mous school of law, Osgoode Hall, where he pursued his law studies, and 
received admission to the bar in 1887. He served under articles with Blake 
and Company at Toronto, and after he was admitted to the bar he practiced 
at Exeter, Ontario, until 1891. In that year he came to Vancouver, where 
he was admitted to the bar of this province, and in 1892 located permanently 
at Nelson. He is in partnership with R. S. Lennie, and they conduct a 
large legal business in this district. Since 1900 Mr. Elliot has been a 
bencher of the Law Society of British Columbia. 

RICHARD MARPOLE. 

Richard Marpole, for thirty years connected with railroad interests, is 
now filling the important office of general superintendent of the Pacific Di- 
vision of the Canadian Pacific Railway, transferred to this position from 
the Lake Superior Division in April, 1886. He became one of the earliest 
residents of British Columbia, and through the intervening years his close 
application to his duties and his personal worth have ever commanded for 
him the highest respect and confidence of those whom he has met in business 
and social relations. 

Mr. Marpole was born in Wales, Great Britain, in October. 1852, his 
parents being Richard and Eleanor (Evans) Marpole, also natives of Wales. 
The father was a merchant first and later a farmer. He died at the age of 
sixty-five years, his wife at the age of sixty. Both were members of the 
Church of England.

BRITISH COLUMBIA 705 

In the schools of his native country. Richard Marpole. of Vancouver, 
acquired his early education, which was supplemented by study in Glasgow, 
Scotland. He has been continuously engaged in railroading since his six- 
teenth year, at first being engaged on English roads, after which he came 
to Canada and finally to the Pacific coast country. He was first em- 
ployed as assistant manager of construction. Lake Superior Division, 
later as superintendent, and in 1886 was transferred in that capacity to 
the Pacific Division and became general superintendent in 1897. which 
position he now occupies in a most capable manner, his service being said 
to be entirely satisfactory to the corporation. Thus his railroad service cov- 
ers thirty years — ^years marked by the utmost fidelity to duty. He is 
thoroughly familiar with the duties of the position, even to the slightest 
detail, and, therefore, capably controls its affairs. 

Mr. Marpole has three sons, Clarence, Dalton and Richard. The first 
two are merchants of Vancouver and the last named is attending school. 

WILLIAM HOLLAND KEARY. 

William Holland Keary, the present mayor of New Westminster, has 
for many years been among the foremost business men of the city, and also 
recognized as a leader in public affairs. Mr. Keary has spent practically 
all his life in this province, growing up with it from pioneer times, and 
has been closely identified with its progress and especially with the varied 
activities of his own city. Born in Portsmouth, England, April 27, 1859, 
he was a son of James and Mary (Holland) Keary, the one a native of county 
Mayo and the other of Dublin, Ireland. His father was not only an early 
and prominent pioneer of British Columbia, but had a most honorable rec- 
ord as a British soldier. He served in the Crimean war of the fifties, being 
in the commissary department, and participated in the battles of the Alma 
and Balaklava and in the siege of Sebastopol. In the fall of 1859 he came 
out to British Columbia with a detachment of Royal Engineers under the 
command of Colonel Moody, and after leaving the service of the govern- 
ment he went into the coal and wood business on an extensive scale at New 
Westminster. His death was the result of an accident, on December 23, 
1871. 

Mr. Keary was a child when he and his mother arrived in British Colum- 
bia in April of i860. He also has a brother and a sister; Emma, the wife of 
G. W. De Beck, Indian agent at Alert Bay, British Columbia; and Henry, 
in the mining business. Mr. Keary was a boy of fourteen years and in atten- 
dance at St. Louis College at the time his father was killed, and he then 



706 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

returned home and henceforth obtained his education and preparation for 
life through his own efforts, so that he is largely a self-made man. On his 
return home he became an apprentice to the printer's trade, which he fol- 
lowed five years. In 1877 he went into the book and stationery business on 
fiis own account. He sold out his stock in 1884, in which year he was 
appointed accountant, storekeeper and schoolmaster in the British Columbia 
penitentiary, which official duties occupied him until 1894. In the latter 
year he took up insurance and real estate, and has continued in this line of 
business up to the present time. 

Mr. Keary served eight years as alderman of his city, and in 1902 was 
elected to the office of mayor, which he has held by subsequent re-elections 
to the present time, having been the choice of his fellow citizens for this 
office at the election of January 12, 1905. He is manager of the provincial 
exhibition, to which position he was appointed four years ago. He is a char- 
ter member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen in New Westmin- 
ster, joining in 1878, and is also affiliated with the Canadian Order of For- 
esters. For a number of years he has been secretary of the Royal Colum- 
bian Hospital at New Westminster. He is president of the Ladies' Benev- 
olent Society, is president of the Vanstone Heating Company in New West- 
minster, and is police and license commissioner. All these activities show 
the breadth of his interests and the place of usefulness which he occupies in 
his city. 

Mr. Keary was married in 1881 to Miss Mary Caroline Eickhoff. She 
is a native daughter of British Columbia, her father, Henry Eickhoff, having 
located in the province in 1862, being a merchant and hotel proprietor for a 
number of years. Mr. and Mrs. Keary have six children, James, Parnell, 
Winnie, William O'B., Mary, and Emma, who is the wife of Dr. J. H. Jones. 

HERMAN OTTO BOWE. 

Herman Otto Bovve, who came to British Columbia in 1858, attracted 
by the Fraser river gold excitement, and is now living at New Westminster, 
was born December 3, 1834, in Germany, his parents being John and Elsebe 
(Kruse) Bo we, both natives of the fatherland and representatives of old 
families there. John Bowe was a distiller by trade and followed that pur- 
suit for many years. 

Herman O. Bowe acquired his education in the schools of his native 
country, and when fourteen years of age put aside his text books to enter 
upon his business career. After a year spent as an apprentice in a grocery 
store he went on a sailing vessel and for four years sailed the seas. He then 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 707 

made his way to California in the spring of 1854 and followed mining for 
four years in Tuolumne county. In 1858 he came to British Columbia, 
attracted by the Fraser river gold excitement, and the following year he 
began keeping a store at Big Bar on the Fraser river in connection with 
Charlie Fenton. The following year he sold out to his partner and turned 
his attention to stock raising in the Alkali valley, which lies opposite the 
mouth of the Chillicotin river. There he took up two thousand acres of 
agricultural and grazing land and he has since devoted his attention largely 
to stock raising, being associated with the Hon. Tom Elven. They were 
the first to engage in this industry in British Columbia, taking up the busi- 
ness in 1861. Their first lot of stock consisted of about five hundred head 
of cattle which they imported from Oregon. The partnership was main- 
tained until 1864, when Mr. Elven sold out to Mr. Bowe and has since been 
in business alone. In 1861 he established a public house at Alkali Lake, 
which is still part of the estate. In 1901 he gave up the active management 
of his stock interests, which he turned over to his son John, w^ho is now 
conducting the ranch and the business connected therewith. Mr. Bowe, how- 
ever, has been closely identified with the development of the stock industry 
in his part of the province and he is thoroughly familiar with the history of 
the northwest because of his long residence here and by reason of his active 
connection with many business interests here. The trip between San Fran- 
cisco and British Columbia was made by steamer and he landed at Bellingham 
Bay in July, 1858. In 1874 and in 1875 he sent in a band of cattle numbering 
seventy-five head to the Skeena river, the price being about fifty dollars per 
head on the hoof. This w^as one of the earliest stock sales in the locality. 

In 1903 Mr. Bowe was called upon to mourn the loss of his first wife, 
and in June, 1904, he was married again, his second union being with Mrs. 
.Sarah Allkins, the widow of Charles Allkins. They make their home on 
Queens avenue in New Westminster, and Mr. Bowe is a valued member of 
the Westminster Club. Recognizing the business opportunities of the great 
northwest he has through the improvement of these become one of the sub- 
stantial citizens of the section of British Columbia in which he makes his 
home. 

J. FRED HUME. 

A prominent and progressive citizen of Nelson, British Columbia, is 
J. Fred Hume, the well known proprietor of the Hume Hotel and one of 
the best known men in the province. This hostelry was erected in 1898, 
at a cost of sixty thousand dollars, and is now numbered among the most 



708 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

popular resorts in the province. It covers a ground space of seventy-five 
by one hundred and twenty feet, and is three stories in height, with attic and 
basement. Its proprietor has become a favorite with the travehng public, 
his peculiarily well adapted characteristics and affability of manner making 
him a host most attractive to his guests. 

The political interests of the province have also received a share of the 
time and attention of Mr. Hume. From 1898 to 1899 he served as minister 
of mines, and for four years prior to that time represented his district in the 
provincial parliament, discharging his duties in both positions with the ut- 
most fidelity and trust. He is of a progressive spirit, giving his influence and 
contributing largely of his means to advance all enterprises tending to the 
promotion of the welfare of his home, and as the proprietor of one of the 
leading hotels of the province he is deservedly popular with all. 

ROBERT WOOD. 

The town of Greenwood is a monument to the enterprise and business 
capacity of Robert Wood, its founder and one of its principal promoters. 
The upbuilding of this town and the development of the industrial facili- 
ties and resources of the surrounding country are what Mr. Wood regards 
as the principal achievements of a very busy and interesting career. 

Born in Walpole township, Haldimand county, Ontario, in 1841, a 
son of Rev. William and Rachel (Pugsley) Wood, both of whom are now 
deceased, he passed his boyhood and gained his education in the schools at 
Simcoe; but being of a restless disposition and a natural pioneer, he ^vas 
always looking forward for the chance to explore the great west, and while 
yet a boy laid his books aside and suddenly started ofif with Alonzo Davis, 
an old forty-niner, for the placer excitement in Cariboo in the spring of 
1862. He was not as successful in mining ventures as he had anticipated, 
and in the fall of the same year left the mines and took up farming on the 
Fraser river below New Westminster. In 1882 he came to the Okanogan 
country and started a business at Landstown, but there his building was 
destroyed by fire, at once, however, being rebuilt and his business continued 
with success. Later removing to Armstrong, he practically founded that 
town on his own ranch. In 1895, coming to the present site of Greenwood 
to investigate the outlook for mining and trading in this locality, he was 
very much impressed both by the resources of the mineral district and the 
natural advantages offered for a town site, and at once began the work 
of laying out a new town. This has been his home since that time. The 
townsite is owned by the firm of R. Wood and Company, Mr. Wood having 



BRITISH COLUMBIA TU9 

soki a large part of the land in the plat to C. Scott Galloway. Greenwood 
is now a substantial and prosperous town, with many improvements and 
advantages as a residence and business center, and its prosperity has in large 
measure been due to Mr. Wood's public-spirited enterprise. 

He and a numl)er of other citizens of Greenwood being owners of a 
lot of new mining property in the west fork of Kettle river, fifty miles west 
of Greenwood, it was evident to Mr. Wood that nothing could be done in 
developing the mining resources of this new district until transportation 
was provided. After an ineffectual interview with the Canadian Pacific 
officials, who gave him no encouragement in the matter, he himself studied 
out a scheme for building a railroad from Vernon to Midway via West 
Fork, and after a careful examination of the field to be covered by the 
enterprise he became convinced of the vast benefit to all the country involved 
and especially to the new mining district. His determination to carry 
through his transportation scheme has never been weakened by difficulties, 
apathy or opposition, and he has worked first and last for its success, which 
at this writing is assured. After his plans were formed he at once took a 
number of associates, obtained, in 1901, a charter and a bonus of four thou- 
sand dollars a mile, then, in 1902, a renewal of the charter with improved 
conditions and a subsidy of five thousand dollars per mile constructed, and 
it; IC03 succeeded in getting a Dominion charter and a subsidy of six thou- 
sand dollars a mile. After overcoming many difficulties and discourage- 
ments it is a matter of pride with Mr. Wood to state that at this date (Au- 
gust, 1905), the road is under construction and he is looking forward with 
merited pleasure to his first ride over the line and to seeing the first carload 
of ore hauled by this route to the Greenwood smelter. Mr. Wood has 
been materially assisted in his many projects by the energy and business 
capacity of his wife, formerly Miss Margaret McLennan, of Port Rowan, 
Ontario. Mr. Wood is a member of the Masonic fraternity and of the 
Church of England. Influential in public affairs, he served as mayor for the 
first two terms after the founding of Greenwood, and is now a justice of 
the peace. He has given his influence to the steady and substantial develop- 
ment of Greenwood and vicinity, rather than endeavoring to "boom" the 
place in any way, and this economic policy has been most satisfactory to all 
concerned.

JOHN PECK. 

John Peck, of New Westminster, is a fine representative of the modern 
industrial and technical activities which have revolutionized all departments 
of the world's work during the past half century. A son of John and Caro^ 
line Elizabeth (Clark) Peck, the former a native of Norfolk and the latter 
of Essex, England, his father an industrious and successful farmer and con- 
tractor, Mr. Peck was born in Essex, near London, in 1861, and spent his 
early years on his father's farm and went to a boarding school in Essex. 

At an early age manifesting decided aptitude for mechanical pursuits, 
at" the age of twelve he began learning the operation of traction and steam 
ploughing engines in the Essex steam plough works. Two years later, in 
1875, he became an apprentice in the establishment of John and Water Wit- 
tingham, and here his two previous years' experience with machinery en- 
abled him to complete his apprenticeship in three years instead of the regu- 
lar period of five years. As apprentice he learned blacksmithing, boilermak- 
ing, draughting, pattern making, and became acquainted with the details 
of machine shop and construction work. After serving his apprenticeship 
he continued to work for the same firm one year. 

In 1882 he emigrated to Canada, to Winnipeg, and was employed on 
the Canadian Pacific Railroad as fitter, erector, leading hand and superin- 
tendent of water supply, on the line between Brandon and Swift Current. 
Then for two seasons he superintended the steam ploughing machinery at 
the well known Qu'Appelle farm in Northwest Territory. Not yet satisfied 
with his technical equipment, he returned to England in the fall of 1885, 
and after passing successful examinations for the civil service, he obtained 
a position of engineer to the local government board for the districts of 
Wandsworth and Clapham in the southwest district of London. Then, to 
utilize all his spare time and his night hours, he entered Birbeck Institute, 
in Chancery Lane, an.d the city guilds and guilds of the London Institute, and 
there followed out a thorough four years' course in the evening classes, grad- 
uating with ample qualifications for teaching and carrying on practical work 
in mechanical and electrical engineering and the allied sciences. 

In 1890 Mr. Peck came to British Columbia, accepting a position as 
machinist with the Reid and Currie Iron Works in New Westminster; later 
he was engineer on the steamer Constance, and then returned as foreman 
of the iron works. On the failure of this company he was appointed liqui- 
dator, and after winding up the affairs of the concern he became manager and 
part owner in the reorganized company. Buying additional ground, he estab- 



■s (' , V I II (I 
■. I I', (; fi'; II', 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 711 

Ushed the Vulcan Iron Works, which continued as one of the foremost indus- 
tries of the province until its destruction in the great fire of 1898. 

In June, 1899, Mr. Peck was appointed by the provincial government 
as inspector of steam boilers and machinery for the province, in which his 
technical training and abilities have since found full scope. In June, 1901, 
after he had gone over the ground and made his reports, a number of in- 
spectors were appointed and a board formed, at which time he was made 
chief inspector of machinery, which is his present ofiice. 

All things pertaining to the general welfare of his community elicit the 
interest of Mr. Peck, and especially anything in the line of his profession. 
In 1890 he started the Mechanics Institute in New Westminster, an institu- 
tion which has been of inestimable practical value for the promotion of 
technical education. He has been a member of the IxDard of trade since 
1894, and was a director in the Royal Agricultural and Industrial Society. 
In 1899 he served as city alderman, and during that time did much effective 
service as chairman of the fire, water and ferry committee. He was elected 
in 1905 a member of New Westminster board of school trustees. 

Mr. Peck married, in 1886, Miss Agnes E. Bacon. Their two children 
are Arthur Evan and Ethel Agnes. 

EDWARD R. NORTHROP, M. D. 

Dr. Edward R. Northrop, until May, 1905, numbered among the medi- 
cal practitioners of Grand Forks, was born in Seymour, Connecticut, Decem- 
ber 3, 1870, and for about six years had been identified with the professional 
interests of this place. The public acknowledged his capability as a repre- 
sentative of the medical fraternity and he enjoyed a liberal share of the public 
patronage. In addition to his private practice he Avas physican for the Gran- 
by Smelter. He is a licensed physician of Washington and of Pennsylvania 
and belongs to the Medical Association of British Columbia, and that of the 
United States. He is a young man of strong purpose and laudable ambition, 
brooking no obstacles that can be overcome by determination and earnest 
effort and well qualified for his practice he gained a place in the front rank 
among the representatives of the medical fraternity in this portion of British 
Columbia. 

In June, 1899, Dr. Northrop married Miss Laura Merwarth, a daugh- 
ter of Sylvester Merwarth. of Easton, Pennsylvania, and they have one 
child. During his residence in British Columbia he gained many warm 
friends and when in May, 1905, he resigned his position at the Granby 
Smelter and removed to Spokane, Washington, he was the recipient of many 



712 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

expressions of sincere regret at his departure. He is now the appointed 
surgeon for the Spokane Traction Company and alHed lines, and enjoys a 
large and profitable practice. 

THOMAS SHANNON. 

Thomas Shannon, who has perhaps done more for the improvement of 
the standard of stock raising than any other man in the province is now 
living in Cloverdale. He was born Marcli 24, 1843, and was educated in 
the public schools of the county of Victoria, Lindsay, Ontario. He left 
school at the age of seventeen years and in 1861 started with his brother 
William for the Pacific coast. Going to California he was there engaged 
in mining, and in the fall of 1863 he came to British Columbia. In the 
spring of 1864 he went to Cariboo, where he engaged in mining for "one 
season, and in 1865 he took up the land in Chilli wack valley, where he 
remained until the spring of 1874. About that time he was married and 
removed to Sumas, where he was engaged in stock raising until 1856, when 
he took up his residence which is his present place of abode in Clover Val- 
ley. He was the pioneer settler here, cultivating the first farm in this por- 
tion of the province. He purchased four hundred and eighty acres of land 
and developed one of the best farms in this portion of America. He has 
since carried on general farming and the raising of fancy stock, making 
a specialty of blooded horses, cattle, sheep and pigs. His son, Thomas, Jr., 
is one of the best known stockmen of this portion of the country and won 
a giold medal and thirty dollars in money at the Westminster Agricultural 
Society Fair in 1904 for being the best judge of all kinds of stock, the 
competition being open to the world. 

In 1874 Mr. Shannon was married to Miss Mary Robinson, who was 
born on the Orkney Islands and is a daughter of Samuel Robinson, the 
pioneer fruit grower of the Fraser river valley and one of the first settlers 
of this part of the country, having been identified with the Hudson's Bay 
Company. Mr. and Mrs. Shannon have four sons and a daughter : Sam- 
uel Howard, who has charge of his father's farm and is superintendent of 
the Union Sunday School at Cloverdale, is also prominent and active in 
other walks of life, being a director and mem.ber of the Royal Agricultural 
Society of Westminster and a director and member of the British Colum- 
bia Agricultural Society of Victoria. For many years he was correspondent 
of the Farmers' Advocate of London for British Columbia. Mary Jane, 
the only daughter, is teaching school. George Walken, Thomas and John 
Weslev are all at home. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 713 

Mr. Shannon has traveled extensively through the province and is 
well posted on the general resources of the country. He was the first reeve 
of the municipality of Surrey and was connected with the council as field 
reeve or councilman for the first ten years after its incorporation in 1880. 
He has long taken a leading part in agricultural affairs and is a member of 
the Royal Agricultural Society of Westminster. He and his sons have done 
more perhaps toward raising the standard of stock interests than any man 
in the province. Mr. Shannon is also connected with the Ancient Order of 
United Workmen and is a charter meml^er of the Independent Order of Odd 
Fellows at Cloverdale. 

JOHN SAMPSON. 

John Sampson, one of the foremost farmers of the Chilliwack valley, 
has had a prosperous and most active career, spent in various parts of the 
world, and during the period of his residence in the province of British 
Columbia he has enjoyed the highest esteem and respect of his fellow citi- 
zens and become an aggressive and valuable factor in affairs of citizen- 
ship and material welfare. 

Mr. .Sampson is a native son of the old county of Cornwall, England, 
where he was born May 20, 1859, and he has since lost by death both of his 
parents, William and Margaret Edwards (Tyacke) Sampson. He attended 
the Cornwall public schools during his youth and at the same time found, 
busy employment on his father's farm, where he learned practical lessons of 
industry and skill and where he remained until he was nineteen years old. 
In 1878 he left home and emigrated to the fertile island of New Zealand, 
and remained in the southern hemisphere engaged in farming for seven 
years and a half. He then returned to Cornwall and farmed his native 
soil for four years. In 1891 he came out to the Dominion and bought a 
farm at Stonewall, where, however, he remained but nine months. In 1892 
he came to Vancouver, and for several years was engaged in farming near 
Sumas, where he rented a place of twelve hundred acres. In 1898 he moved 
to his present location in the Chilliwack valley, where he owns one hundred 
and twenty acres, and rents an additional ninety-four acres. All of this 
land is under a high state of cultivation, and for careful operation and 
productivity his is one of the model farms of the valley. He also has one of 
the most comfortable and substantial farm houses of the locality, it being 
surrounded by a beautiful garden and grounds, and every appliance and 
improvement suggesting a high degree of skill and progressiveness in the 
owner of the estate. 



714 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. Sampson returned to New Zealand in 1901 and there married Miss 
Margaret Fleming Bain, a daughter of Robert Bain, of that country. They 
are members of the Methodist church. 

GEORGE TURNER. 

George Turner, a prominent British Columbia pioneer, having arrived 
in the country in the spring of 1859. and now and for many years past con- 
nected with the Dominion government department of public works as a civil 
engineer, has been identified in countless ways with the history of his present 
home city of New Westminster from the date of its founding in the heart 
of the wilderness, through its subsequent career of prosperous development, 
to its happy and flourishing condition of today. 

Born in London, England, September 17, 1836, of English and Scotch 
ancestry, a son of George and Helena (Wright) Turner, both English born, 
and the former of whom was a soldier in the British army and died in the 
service of his country while in the East Indies, Mr. Turner was reared by 
his widowed mother, and an uncle and his grandmother, and grew up in 
London, receiving his education in the schools of the metropolis. In March, 
1855, being then nineteen years old, he joined the Royal Engineers, and on 
the 5th of September was assigned to work in government surveying, since 
which date he has been continually employed in this line of work, either on 
public or private enterprises. Several years later he and twenty other sur- 
veyors joined the British Columbia detachment which were sent around the 
Horn in the sailing vessel Thames City to their destination. This party 
surveyed not only in the New Westminster district, but the entire province 
for a number of years until the detachment was broken up, and since then 
he has continued civil engineering largely on his own account. Few men 
have a wnder knowledge and acquaintance throughout the entire province, 
all of which has been the field of his work. When he arrived in the spring 
of 1859 New Westminster did not exist, and the engineering corps of- w^hich 
he was a member located the site, cleared away part of the dense forest, 
and gave location and name to what has since grown into this thriving city. 
There were, of course, plenty of Indians in the neighborhood, and the Eraser 
river gold discoveries of the previous year had attracted large numbers of 
miners, principally Americans, but these latter were not permanent and soon 
retired from the field. The river and the old Indian trails were the courses 
and avenues of trade and pioneer conditions were an every day fact for some 
years after Mr. Turner made his arrival. And especially wonderful to 
such an old-timer as Mr. Turner seems the transformation which has been

BRITISH COLUMBIA 715 

wrought ill every condition and environment of civilization during the forty- 
five years of his career in this province. Mr. Turner was employed one 
year with the Canadian Pacific Railway — the railroads also made their 
appearance in British Columbia after his advent. In the employ of the 
Dominion and the provincial government he has laid out many of the wagon 
roads of the province, has also platted townsites, and done much engineer- 
ing work for private corporations. His work has led him in exploration of 
the coast and the country in every direction, and he has been instrumental 
in many ways in building up the country. 

In the early days Mr. Turner was a member of the Seymour artillery. 
He has served in the city council of New Westminster; is a member of the 
Church of England; is a charter member of the independent Order of 
Odd Fellows in New Westminster, and of the Ancient Order of United 
Workmen. His present work as engineer is confined mainly to the opera- 
tions in' the channel of the Fraser river under the direction of the govern- 
ment. 

In July, 1869, Mr. Turner was married to Mrs. x'Xnn McColl, the widow 
of Sergeant McColl. She had six children by her first husband and three 
by her union with Mr. Turner, and they are all well settled in life. Mrs. 
Turner came to this province in 1861. Her children by Mr. McColl are: 
William, connected with the Imperial Canning Company; Mary Ann, who 
is the wife of Hugh Boyd, now residing in Belfast, Ireland; Helen, the wife 
of E. S. Scoullar, of Vancouver; Neil Lucknow. James and Miss Maria J. 
Mr. and Mrs. Turner's children are Frederick George, in the real estate 
business in Vancouver; Maud E., the wife of Herbert Appleby, who is with 
the Canadian Pacific Railway; and Annie H., the wife of J. R. Grant. 

HENRY ALEXANDER STEWART. 

Henry Alexander Stewart, practicing law in Nelson where he has 
resided since 1899, was born in Anchencloich, Ayreshire, Scotland, on the 
28th of December, 1869, his parents being Charles S. and Eliza (Copland) 
Stewart. His father has departed this life, but the mother yet resides in 
London, England. Henry A. Stewart accompanied his parents on their 
removal from Scotland to England when but three years of age and he 
pursued his education in two of the best known institutions of learning in 
that country, Eton and Cambridge. After leaving college he went to Lin- 
coln's Inn, where he prepared for his profession and was called as a bar- 
rister in 1895. He practiced for two years in London, during which time 
lie earned just two guineas. Great is the competition there and it is with 



716 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the utmost difficulty that the new lawyer makes a start in the world's me- 
tropolis. Realizing that he must enter a more lucrative field of professional 
labor Mr. Stewart came to the far west, arriving in British Columbia in 
1897. Here he entered upon a more advantageous field of labor, being for 
a time associated with Mr. Cassidy in practice in Victoria. For a year after- 
ward he was with the firm of Fulton &amp; Wall, of Kamloops, and in 1899 
he came to Nelson where he has since remained in practice. 

In 1900 Mr. Stewart was united in marriage to Miss Emily Aspland, 
a daughter of Sydney Aspland, of California. They have two children, 
Euphenia and David. Mr. Stewart is a Liberal in his political views and 
he is secretary of the Nelson Club. 

WILLIAM WATTS. 

William Watts, manager and founder of the Vancouver shipyard, was 
born in Collingswood, Ontario, on the 31st of December, 1862. The Watts 
family is of Irish lineage and his parents, William and Susan (Newton) 
Watts, were both natives of the Emerald Isle. The father was born in 
county Sligo and in 1849 emigrated to Canada, but subsequently returned 
to the Emerald Isle, where he wedded Miss Newton. He then brought his 
bride to the new world, going "first to Toronto and afterward to Collings- 
wood, where they reared their family of eleven children. Mr. Watts made 
ship and boat building his life work and is today the oldest shipbuilder of 
Canada, being in his seventy-fifth year, while his wife is sixty-five years of 
age. 

William Watts, the only member of the family in British Columbia, 
acquired his education in his native town and learned the shipbuilder's trade 
with his father. He has continuously engaged in that business from boy- 
hood to the present time. Making his way to the Pacific coast, he spent a 
year in Oakland and in San Francisco and became informed in the latest 
methods and designs used in shipbuilding there. Coming to Vancouver 
in 1888, he secured employment in that line and when his industry and econ- 
omy had brought him sufficient capital to engage in business on his own 
account he established the Vancouver Shipyard in 1899, remaining as pro- 
prietor of the business until 1902, when he became one of the stockholders 
upon its incorporation. The incorporators were William Watts, J. W. Mac- 
fir, Russell Banester, E. B. Morgan, Captain Tait and George Taylor. The 
last named was elected president, James W. Macfir secretary and treasurer, 
and Mr. Watts m.anager. The principal work of the company is the build- 
ing of yachts, fishing boats, canoes and racing shells and they do repair 



BRITISH COLUMBIA Ti7 

work of all kinds. They have both steam and electric power and marine 
ways and can take out two hundred tons weight. They also have a ma- 
chine shop in connection with the business, of which Mr. McD'oogal is man- 
ager and their plant is equipped with* all the tools and appliances necessary 
for any kind of repairing in their line. 

In 1892 Mr. Watts was married to Miss Emily Louise Leckie, a native 
of Toronto, and a daughter of John Leckie. They have two sons, Howard 
and Clarence, and their home is a nice residence at No. 1208 Georgia ave- 
nue. Mr. Watts was reared in the faith of the Church of England, but he 
and his wife are now members of the Presbyterian church and he belongs 
to the Masonic fraternity and to the Independent Order of Odd Eellows. 

GEORGE W. CHADSEY. 

George W. Chadsey, now of Chilli wack, is a pioneer citizen of New 
Westminster district, where for the past forty years he has engaged in a 
varied and useful activity. As a farmer and stockman his success has been 
large, and he has been known for years as a substantial and prosperous 
man of affairs. His executive and administrative ability has also found 
other channels, and he has performed with equal energy and zeal as in pri- 
vate affairs the duties which have come to him as a citizen and member of 
society. 

Mr. Chadsey is a native of Prince Edward Island, born in Ontario 
county, March 25, 1846, and his parents, James L. and Lucy (Hill) Chad- 
sey, are both deceased. Educated in the public schools of Northumberland 
county, he afterward engaged in farm work in the states of New York and 
Michigan, and got a good preparation for the career which he was to follow 
throughout life. He came to British Columbia in 1865, ^^^ joining the 
first colony of settlers at Sumas, he pre-empted land there, and, when a 
youth of about twenty years, began to devote his energies and industry to 
making a success of agriculture in this province. Besides his pre-emption 
he purchased other land, and owned three hundred and seventy-two acres 
in that locality. For thirty-three years, a third of a century, he continued 
farming in its general phases and the raising of stock. In 1899 he moved 
to Chilliwack, where he has since made his home. He owns a beautiful 
residence in towai, and also a tract of one hundred and sixty acres in the 
valley. 

In 1887 Mr. Chadsey was appointed registrar of county court of New 
Westminster and notary public, and he still holds these offices. He is also 
■registrar of births, deaths and marriages, and registrar of voters; is col- 



71« BRITISH COLUMBIA 

lector of the municipality, and is secretary of the Chilliwack Agricultural 
Society. 

He was married in 1870 to Miss Eliza Jane Thorne, a daughter of 
Edmund Thorne, of Brighton, Ontario. Their six children are as follows : 
Edna Augusta, the wife of J. A. Evans, of Chilliwack; George Edmund; 
Stephen A. and David W., twins; and Burdette Louise and Helen Geor- 
giana Eliza. 

FREDERICK J. HART. 

Frederick J. Hart, insurance, real estate and financial agent at New 
Westminster, is an enterprising and successful representative of the class 
of young business men in British Columbia. Beginning practical life as a 
clerk in a store, he has ever since been making his way steadily to larger 
and more important fields of effort, and the fifteen years of his connection 
with the business interests of his present home city has been a period of 
increasing prosperity for himself and of benefit to the general welfare. 

Mr. Hart was born in Trinity, Newfoundland, a son of William and 
Elizabeth (Finch) Hart, who came to Newfoundland from their native city 
of Birmingham, England. Mr. Hart's early education was received in the 
schools Colonial and Continental School Society. On leaving school at the 
age of eighteen he became a clerk in a mercantile house at St. Johns, New- 
foundland, and after spending two years there came to British Columbia 
in 1890, having made New Westminster his permanent home ever since. 
Ehiring the first eight months he was employed on the construction of the 
waterworks system. He then became a clerk in an insurance office, and in 
a little more than a year, in 1891, he bought out his employers, and has 
since conducted a general insurance, real estate ajid financial business on his 
own account. In May, 1905. the business was incorporated under the style 
of F. J. Hart and Company, limited, and established a branch office at Van- 
couver, British Columbia, Mr. Hart being president and general manager. 
Mr. Hart is identified with other interests, among them being Westmin- 
ster Trust and Safe Deposit Company, Limited, the Western Steamboat 
Company, Limited, being its manager, and the Westminster Masonic Tem- 
ple Company, Limited. His transactions in these lines have been steadily 
increasing in volume and value, and he is now a leading representative of 
that class of business in the province. 

Mr. Hart is a public-spirited citizen and is actively concerned in mat- 
ters pertaining to the improvement of his city. He served as an alderman 
in 1902. He is a member of the council of the local board of trade. Mr.

Hart is commissioner in British Columbia for the Island of Newfoundland. 
As a Conservative he has always manifested much interest in local and pro- 
vincial politics. Fraternally he affiliates with the Masons, the Independent 
Order of Odd Fellows, and with the Sons of England. 

In 1895 Mr. Hart married Miss xA.lice Chapman, who was born in 
Birmingham, England. Her father, Edward Chapman, emigrated to New- 
foundland when a young- man. Three children have been torn of this mar- 
riage; namely, Kingsley Chapman, Florence Elizabeth and Fredrica Alice. 

JAMES MUIRHEAD. 

Victoria includes among its representative business men and respected 
citizens James Muirhead, who has long been identified with its industrial 
interests as. a manufacturer of sash, doors and mouldings. He was born in 
Starlingshire, Scotland, on the 20th of November, 1837, and is a descendant 
of an old and honored Scotch family, of w^hich country his parents, John 
and Agnes (McClern) Muirhead, were also natives. In his youth the father 
went to Halifax, there learning the carpenter's trade, and after spending 
some years in that city as a carpenter and builder he returned to Scotland, 
and the remainder of his life was spent in his native land. He was a man 
of sterling character, and attained to a ripe old age, his honored wife pre- 
ceding him several years to the home beyond. They were worthy mem- 
bers of the Presbyterian church, and in their family were four children. 

James Muirhead, the only member of his father's family in the Prov- 
ince, received his education in Glasgow, Scotland, there also learning the 
carpenter and joiner's trade. In 1857 he left his native land of hills and 
heather and went to Ontario, Canada, where he worked at his chosen occu- 
pation for about two years, after which he went to New York City, thence 
to New Orleans, and for two and a half years was a resident of Peru. In 
1862 he came to Victoria, British Columbia, this journey being due to the 
many thrilling stories he had heard concerning the Cariboo gold discov- 
eries, but in place of going to the diggings he decided to follow the occu- 
pation he had previously learned and thus became a contractor and builder 
in Victoria. Among other work on which he was engaged was the build- 
ing of the penitentiary. In 1870 the firm of Muirhead &amp; Mann was 
formed, and they embarked in the manufacture of sash, doors and all kinds 
of wood work for building purposes, and in addition they have also done 
considerable steamboat work, the steamer Princess Beatrice being among 
the number completed by this firm. Mr. Mann is now retired from the busi- 
ness, and Mr. Muirhead is associated therein with his two sons, John Thomas 



720 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

?.nd James McClearn. In his family are also two daughters, Agnes and 
Bertha. 

The marriage of Mr. Muirhead occurred in 1870, when Miss Rebecca 
Fleming became his wife, her birth occurring in Australia, but she is of 
Scotch parentage. The family reside in a beautiful residence which Mr. 
Muirhead has had built on the Esquimault Road. Throughout the period 
of his residence here he has been identified with many business interests, 
has acquired considerable valuable city property, and is numbered among 
Victoria's prominent and successful citizens. 

HON. GORDON HUNTER. 

Hon. Gordon Hunter, chief justice of the province of British Colum- 
bia, is a native of Ontario, Canada, born in Bansville, on the 4th of May, 
1863, and is of Scotch and Irish ancestry. His father, J. Howard Hunter, 
was born in the south of Ireland and is descended from one of the old and 
distinguished families of that country. He married Miss Ann Gordon, a 
native of the highlands of Scotland, representing one of the old families 
that for generations had lived in the mountainous districts of Scotland. In 
i860 Mr. and Mrs. J. Howard Hunter emigrated to Ontario, Canada, 
where they are both living, he occupying an important office of honor and 
trust in that city. They became the parents of seven children, Judge Hun- 
ter being the only one in British Columbia. Two of the sons are promi- 
nent barristers of Ontario. Having acquired his preliminary education Judge 
Hurler continued his studies in the Toronto University, of which he is 
graduate of the class of 1885 and his superior proficiency in his different 
studies won for him both the gold and silver medal given by that institu- 
tion. Determining upon the practice of law as a life work, he became a 
student in the office of McCortney &amp; Osier and was graduated in 1888. For 
a1x)ut three years he practiced in Ontario and in 1891 came to Victoria, 
British Columbia. In the following April he was admitted to the bar of 
the province, but soon afterward received the appointment of crown solici- 
tor. He formed a partnership with Hon. Theodore Davie, late chief jus- 
tice of the province, and the relation was maintained until the elevation of 
Judge Davie to the bench. Mr. Hunter then formed a partnership with 
Mr. Duff and is now a justice of Victoria. Judge Hunter held the ofiice 
of labor commissioner and in March, 1902, was made chief justice of the 
province. The legal profession demands a high order of ability, anc' a 
rare combination of talent, learning, tact, patience and industry. The suc- 
cessful lawyer and the competent judge must be a man of well-balanced intel- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 721 

lect, thoroughly familiar with the law and practice, of general informa- 
tion, possessed of an analytical mind and a comprehensive self control that 
will enable him to lose his individuality, his personal feelings, his preju- 
dices and his peculiarities of disposition in the dignity, impartiality and 
equity of the office to which life, property, right and liberty must look for 
protection. Possessing these qualities Judge Hunter justly merits the high 
honor which was conferred upon him by his elevation to his present high 
office. 

In January, 1896, Judge Hunter was married to Mrs. Ada Nelson, a 
daughter of Charles F. Johnson and a native of Springfield, Illinois. Their 
residence is located in Belleville avenue, overlooking James Bay and the 
city, and its attractive hospitality is greatly enjoyed by their many friends. 
Judge Hunter is a man of fine personal appearance, five feet eight inches in 
height and weighing two hundred pounds. He has a splendid physical 
development and, moreover, he possesses the sterling traits of character 
which command confidence and respect in every land and clime. Entirely 
free from ostentation or display, approachable and genial, he nevertheless 
has upon the bench the dignity which should ever be associated with his 
high office and the citizens of the province have every reason to l^e proud 
of their chief justice. 

HON. LYMAN P. DUFF. 

Hon. Lyman P. Duff, a justice of the supreme court of the province 
of British Columbia, and one of the abler representatives of a bar which 
numbers many men of talent, was born in Meadfield, Ontario, on the 7th 
of January, 1865, and is descended from Scotch ancestry. His father, the 
Rev. Charles Duff, was born in England, in which country he acquired his 
education and was ordained to the ministry of the Congregational church. 
When a young man he crossed the Atlantic to Ontario, where he formed 
the acquaintance of Miss Isabelle Johnson, a native of the Dominion, whom 
he made his wife. For many years he devoted his time and energies to the 
active work of the church but has now retired from the ministry and re- 
sides in Ontario, in the seventieth year of his age. 

Judge Duff, the only member of the family residing in British Colum- 
bia, obtained his literary education in Toronto University, where he won 
the degree of Bachelor of Arts upon his graduation with the class of 1886, 
and in 1890 the same institution conferred upon him the degree of Bachelor 
of Law, when he had qualified for admission to the bar. He entered upon 
the practice of his profession in Ontario in 1893 and he came to Victoria 



722 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

in 1895. In less than ten years he has been elevated to the supreme bench. 
In his law practice his success came soon because his equipment was unusu- 
ally good. Along with those qualities indispensable to the lawyer, a keen, 
rapid, logical mind plus the business sense, and a ready capacity for hard 
work, he brought to the starting point of his legal career certain rarer gifts 
— eloquence of language and a strong personality. An excellent presence, 
an earnest, dignified manner, marked strength of character, a thorough 
grasp of the law, and the ability to accurately apply its principles are factors 
in his effectiveness as an advocate, and on the bench his course has shown 
him to be the peer of older justices of the court of last resort. 

Judge Duff was married in 1898 to Miss Elizabeth Bird, a native of 
Ontario, and they have one of the delightful homes which adorn Victoria. 
Mrs. Duff is a member of the Church of England and he attends its services 
and contributes to its support. During his residence in British Columbia 
he has won warm personal friendship as well as high professional regard, 
and his position socially and at the bar is a merited tribute to his worth and 
talents. 

THOMAS COWAN. 

Thomas Cowan, postmaster at Ladysmith, is a citizen of the Dominion 
and of British Columbia of some twelve years' standing, having come to 
this country early in his business career, and the record he has since made 
shows how deserving he is of the esteem and friendship of his fellow citi- 
zens, whom he has so efficiently served as postmaster during the past several 
years. 

Mr. Cowan is a native Scotchman, having been born in the city of 
Glasgow, September 27, 1868, and his parents, Hugh and Margaret (Boyd) 
Cowan, are still living in the native land of the hills and heather. A public 
school near Glasgow furnished him his early educational equipment for life, 
and on leaving that he immediately went to work in a grocery establishment, 
continuing in that line in the old country until he was twenty-four years 
of age. In 1892 he came out to Nanaimo, British Columbia, and some time 
later to Wellington, in both of which places he continued his work in the 
grocery trade, and in the latter place was also in business on his own ac- 
count. He came to Ladysmith to take charge of the grocery department of 
the Simon Lieser and Company, with which he remained two years. He 
then received his appointment as postmaster, and is most satisfactorily filling 
this office at the present time. 

Mr. Cowan was married in 1893 to Miss Maggie McKay, a daughter 



BRITISH COLUMBIA T23 

of John McKay, of Paisley, Scotland. They have one child, Maggie. Mr. 
Cowan is a meml3er of St. Mirren Lodge No. 129, A. F. &amp; A. M., and of 
Harmony Lodge No. 6, L O. O. F., and he and his wife are Presbyterians. 

C. J. V. SPRATT. 

C. J. V. Spratt is a member of the well known Victoria firm which 
owns and controls the Victoria machinery depot, owns the marine railroad, 
are steamboat builders, and also engineers and designers of vessels. This 
business forms one of the important industries of the city, and has been 
built up and still remains in the hands of one family of capable and ener- 
getic men. This enterprise was established in 1888 by Mr. Spratt's father, 
Joseph Spratt, who was not only a benefactor to his city in this way, but 
also worked for the welfare of Victoria in many other enterprises, and was 
a man honored and esteemed for his high worth of character. 

Mr. C. J. V. Spratt is a native son of Victoria, where he was born Au- 
gust I, 1873. He was educated at Port Hope, and since his father's death 
he has had active charge of the business, and continued to broaden its lines 
of activity and usefulness. In 1896 the firm was incorporated. Mr. A. J. 
Bechtel, a brother-in-law of Mr. Spratt, is a stockholder, and the entire 
business is owned by m.embers of the family. 

Mr. Spratt was happily married in 1894 to Miss Ethel Duel, a native 
of Sacram.ento, California. Tliey are valued members of the Episcopal 
church, and Mr. Spratt is a member of the Native Sons of British Colum- 
bia. Their delightful and hospitable home known as the "Armitage" is 
situated on the Gorge, and Mr, and Mrs. Spratt have a wide acquaintance 
and are held in high esteem in the social circles of Victoria. 

JOHN MESTON. 

John Meston is a Victoria resident of more than thirty years' standing, 
and his personal character and standing in the community are such that his 
name is always mentioned with respect and the esteem due to industry, well 
directed energy, integrity and generous interest in the welfare of city and 
society. These qualities have in fact been the most important elements in 
his success, for he is what may be called a self-made man and began life 
without any capital except keen intelligence and unlimited capacity for lalxir 
at a trade which his early years had been spent in acquiring. In the business 
circles of Victoria Mr. Meston is best known as having made the longest 
and best record as a carriage and wagon maker and blacksmith, and as 



724 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

having built up an establishment of this kind which in extent and excellence 
of workmanship has no equal in the city or province. 

Mr. Meston was born in Scotland in 1849, being of thrifty and worthy 
Scotch Presbyterian ancestry. The most reliable traditions of the family 
point to France as the original home seat. The generations in Scotland 
go back to the learned William Meston, who was born in Midmar, Aberdeen- 
shire, Scotland, in 1688. He was a professor of philosophy in Mareschal 
College of Aberdeen. Having espoused the Stuart cause in the rebellion of 
1 71 5, he was appointed governor of Dunnottar Castle, and later in life he 
became interested in educational institutions. He died in 1745, and in 
1776 a book of his poems was published at Edinburg under the title of 
" Poetical Works of William Meston." He has been described as a fine 
classical scholar, philosopher and mathematician. It is believed that the 
grandfather of this versatile man, the Rev. W. Meston, moved from France 
to Scotland in 1625, thus transferring the name and family seat to Scot- 
land. The most frequently recurring names in the old family records are 
Archibald, Alexander, Charles, James, Thomas, William and John, and the 
various generations of the family in Scotland have had numerous members 
and many of them gained high social, professional and business positions. 

Mr. Meston's father was Archibald, a native of Scotland, who married 
Miss Ann Clark, also a native of that country, and they were well-to-do 
farmers and esteemed members of the Presbyterian church. The father lived 
to the ripe old age of eighty years. 

Mr. Meston is the only member of the family in British Columbia. 
He was educated at his home locality in Scotland, where he also learned his 
trade, and in 1872, when in his twenty-third year, he emigrated to Toronto. 
He arrived there without means other than the possession of a good trade 
and the intelligence and industry necessary tO' make it a success, and the 
very next day after reaching Toronto he began work as a journeyman. 
After remaining in Ontario two years he came out to Victoria, thence went 
on to Moodyville, where he did the iron work for the first sawmill. He 
prospected and mined for a time in Cassar, and by these enterprises made the 
money which enabled him to start in business on his account. He bought 
an interest in a shop in Victoria with Mr. James McKerson as partner 
and six years later bought his partner's interest. Since then he has been 
the sole owner of the business, and through his energy and reputation for 
thorough reliability has built up a very extensive business. In 1892 he built 
the large brick block in which he has his works, equipped with all the 
latest ma'\liinery and tools, and fitted out for all work in carriage-making and 



.BRITISH COLUMBIA 725, 

general blacksmithing. Mr. Meston has built many carriages, wagons and 
vehicles of all kinds. For the past fourteen years he has had the agency 
of a large carria:ge manufactory in Montreal, and also handles the Deering 
farm machinery. His success has been worthily attained, and none can 
envy his position in manufacturing and business circles. 

In 1886 Mr. Meston married Miss Sarah Baker, a native of Ontario, 
and during their happy married life of nearly twenty years three children 
have been born to them in Victoria, namely : John Victor, Sarah Aneta, 
and Joseph Charles Douglas. They have a nice home in Victoria, and it 
is the more enjoyable to them because it is almost entirely of their own 
making. Mr. Meston constructed the iron fence which surrounds the house 
and grounds, and all the trees and shrubs and flowers were set out by their 
own hands. Outside of the large demands which his business makes upon 
his time and energy, Mr, Meston gives his principal attention to his church. 
He is an active member in the First Presbyterian church of Victoria, and 
for many years has been the efficient superintendent of its Sunday school. 
He is a member of the Woodmen of the World, but of recent years has not 
found time to keep up active work in that fraternity. For the welfare and 
progress of his church he is willing to perform all services that may devolve 
upon him, from ringing the bell for service to superintending the Sunday 
school, and his worth in the church and in business is appreciated by all 
who know him. 

WILLIAM F. SALSBURY. 

William Ferriman Salsbury, local treasurer of the Canada Pacific Rail- 
way at Vancouver, is one of the early settlers and upbuilders of the city, 
having come here on the first overland train which reached Vancouver, on 
the 4th of J;Lily, 1886. He settled here in the following May and has since 
been closely identified with its interests, his labors pushing forward the 
wheels of progress. 

A native of Surrey, England, Mr. Salsbury was born on the i6th of 
February, 1847, ^^^ is descended from English ancestry. His father, 
William John Salsbury, was born in England and was there married to 
Miss Sarah Ferriman, a native of the same country. He followed mer- 
chandising for many years and was influential in his home locality. Both he 
and his wife belonged to the Church of England and he died in the fifty- 
eighth year of his age, while his wife, long surviving him, attained the 
advanced age of eighty years. 

William F. Salsbury, the only member of the family in British Columbia, 



726 BRITISH COLUMBIA . 

was educated in his native country and has been continuously connected with 
railroad interests since 1861. He was first in the ticket office at Brighton 
station in England, there remaining for ten years. He emigrated to Canada 
in 1870, and, entering the service of the Grand Trunk Railroad Company, 
acted as assistant in the office of Joseph Hickson, who was then treasurer 
of the road. Mr. Salsbury continued there until February, 1881, when he 
resigned his position to join the forces of the Canadian Pacific Railway 
Company when its line was completed. He at first occupied the position of 
accountant and continued in the financial department of the road, being 
appointed assistant treasurer at Montreal. He then came to Vancouver to 
accept the position of local treasurer of the Pacific division, in which capacity 
he has now been serving for eighteen years. He is a man of excellent 
business ability and executive force and his long connection with the railroad 
service and his varied experience well qualified him for this position and for 
the organization of the department here. 

Immediately after arriving in Vancouver Mr. Salsbury became identified 
with matters of local import and concern and has contributed in large and 
helpful measure to the general good. He has been an active member of 
the board of trade of the city and was its president in 1902-3. He is now a 
member of the council of the board, also on the board of arbitration and on 
the railway and navigation committee. His co-operation may always be 
counted upon in matters of public progress and improvement and the value 
of his labors is widely acknowledged. 

Mr. Salsbury was married in 1870 to Miss Sarah Jane Wales, of English 
ancestry, and they have had five children : Arthur Ernest, William F., 
Lillian, Frederick T. and Mary. They have one of the attractive homes of 
Vancouver. They are members of the Church of England and Mr. Salsbury 
belongs to the Masonic fraternity, being a past master of his lodge. He 
is a worthy representative of British Columbia's busines men and progressive 
citizens and the enterprising spirit of the age has been manifest in his career 
and especially in his efforts for the public good. 

LEWIS FRANCIS BONSON. 

Lewis' Francis Bonson, who- has farming interests in the vicinity of 
New Westminster, was born May 10, 1830, in Peebleshire, Scotland, on the 
Tweed river, his parents being Henry and Marion (Howison) Bonson, who 
were also natives of Scotland and belonged to old families of that country. 
The father was for many years in the employ of Sir Thomas Gibson Car- 
michael, owner of Castle Craig.

BRITISH COLUMBIA 127 

Lewis F. Bonson was educated in the public schools of Kirkurd to the 
age of fifteen years, after which he was apprenticed to the joiner and wheel- 
wright's trade, thus serving for four years. In 1849 he went to Edinburgh 
where he was employed as a joiner until 185 1 after which he followed the 
same pursuit in London until August, 1854. He there became a member 
of the corps of Royal Engineers at Woolwich, where he spent a brief period, 
after which he went to Chatham. In 1855 he served in the Crimea, remain- 
ing until peace was proclaimed in 1856. On leaving the Crimea he went to 
the Garrison of Gibraltar where he remained for five months, when he re- 
turned to England. Two months later he was sent on special service to Cen- 
tral America, and returned early in 1858. When three months had gone by 
he again left the British Isles, this time his destination being British Columbia, 
to which he traveled by way of the Isthmus of Panama. He brought with him 
a party for the purpose of preparing barracks and quarters for the detachment 
of engineers who were en route by way of Cape Horn and who arrived in 
1859. 

In 1863 Mr. Bonson at his own request was discharged from the Corps 
of Engineers and resumed the duties of private life. He turned his atten- 
tion to contracting and building at Westminster and was road superinten- 
dent for the provincial government from 1876 until 1880. He afterward 
engaged in the wholesale liquor business at New Westminster where he re- 
mained until 1892, when he sold out and purchased a farm of three hundred 
and seventy acres at Keatsey, about ten miles from Westminster. There he 
remained until 1905, when he sold a portion of his land. 

On the 1 2th of July, 1858, Mr. Bonson was married to Miss Jemima 
Urquhart, a native of Cromerty, Rosshire, Scotland. They have four sons 
and two daughters. Mr. Bonson was a member of the New Westminster 
Rifles and served as first lieutenant under Captain Peele, this being the first 
volunteer company in New Westminster, 

ANTHONY J. McMillan. 

Anthony J. McMillan, an active representative of mining interests, now 
general manager for the Leroy Company, makes his home in Rossland. 
Nearly every country on the globe has furnished citizens to British Colum- 
bia, but no element in its national existence has proven a more potent fac- 
tor than that furnished by Scotland. Mr. McMillan, a native of the land 
of hills and heather, was educated in England and he yet spends a portion 
of his time in the city of London. He came, however, to British Columbia 
■in 1894 and was largely interested in mining on his own account, at the 



728 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

same time representing some English companies. In 1902 he was made a 
director of the Leroy Company, and his services were considered of such 
value by the directors of the company in England that in 1903 he was 
made managing director in British Columbia, while in September, 1904, he 
was further honored with the position of general manager of the company. 
He has lately reorganized the entire working force of the company and 
the properties now are on a dividend paying basis. When he took charge 
the company had incurred an indebtedness amounting to one million two 
hundred and fifty thousand dollars, but today all financial incumbrance 
has been cleared away and the property is now yielding a good financial 
return. J. W. Ashley has been appointed general superintendent and will 
have charge during the absence of Mr. McMillan. The Leroy properties 
cover the Rossland and Northport Washington trail. Mr. McMillan is 
thoroughly conversant with the subject of mining in the province, has inti- 
mate knowledge of mining conditions, is acquainted with the best processes 
of securing the ore and transforming it into a marketable commodity and 
in this field of endeavor by his executive force, keen discernment and busi- 
ness capacity is contributing in large measure to the success of the com- 
pany and at the same time promoting the general prosperity of the locality 
through the employment furnished to many workmen. 

WILLIAM L. TAIT. 

William L. Tait is a capitalist holding valuable property interests in 
Vancouver, and to him there has come the attainment of a distinguished 
position in connection with the great material industries of the state, and 
his efforts have been so discerningly directed along well defined lines that 
he seems to have realized at any one point of progress the full measure of 
his possibilities for accomplishment at that point. A man of distinct and 
forceful individuality, of broad mentality and most mature judgment, he 
has left and is leaving his impress upon the industrial world. For years 
he has been an important factor in the development of the natural resources 
of the province, in the upbuilding of Vancouver and in the promotion of the 
enterprises which add not alone to his individual prosperity but also ad- 
vance the general welfare and prosperity of the city in which he makes his 
home. 

William L. Tait was born in Scotland in 1850 and is the son of Will- 
iam L. Tait, Sr., who was a native of that country and emigrated to Canada 
in early life. The father was a blacksmith and carriage maker by trade 
and for many years was closely identified with industrial interests. He 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 729 

died in the year 1887 at the advanced age of eighty-eight years. He had 
for a long period been a resident of McKeen county, Pennsylvania, and it 
was there that William L. Tait of this review acquired his early education. 
In 1862 the family went to Canada, where the father spent his remaining 
days, and in the province William L. Tait completed his school life. He 
then entered upon his business career in connection with the manufacture 
of lumber and shingles and before his removal to Vancouver was engaged 
in an enterprise of that character in Winnipeg for some time. The favor- 
able reports heard concerning the far west with its splendid business possi- 
bilities and great natural resources of the country attracted him and on the 
13th of February, 1891, he arrived in Vancouver. The town was then in 
the fifth year of its existence and it has since had a very phenomenal growth. 

Mr. Tait in his business career kept posted with the development of the 
city, improving every opportunity that led to substantial and honorable suc- 
cess. Recognizing the splendid field for following lumber industries he 
engaged in the manufacture of shingles, erecting a shingle mill and a saw- 
mill, which he operated with splendid success for a number of years, having 
a very extensive patronage that brought to him a gratifying financial re- 
turn. In 1902 he sold this property to the Rat Portage Lumber Company, 
which is still conducting a large business. As the years passe'd by and his 
financial resources increased Mr. Tait invested in city property, has erected 
a large number of residences and is still engaged in that business, putting 
forth every effort in the improvement and development of the city. He 
may well be termed one of its promoters, for his efforts have been directed 
along lines that have resulted in general benefit as well as individual pros- 
perity. His own residence at No. 752 Thurlow street is a very commodious 
one, of attractive style of architecture, and is surrounded with beautiful 
flowers and shrubs, indicating the good taste and refinement of the family. 

In 1 87 1 Mr. Tait was married to Miss Jane Donaldson, a native of 
Ontario and of Scotch ancestry. They are the parents of eight children : 
James D., who is engaged in the shingle manufacturing business; Edward 
R., of the firm of Cooke &amp; Tait, shingle and lumber manufacturers of Van- 
couver; Arthur W., who is in the mill with his brother; Ethel, the wife 
of S. Wilson, a boot and shoe merchant of Vancouver; Percy, who is act- 
ing as accountant in his brother's mill; Melville, who is in the employ of 
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company; Edith and C. L., at home. The 
family hold' membership in St. Andrew's Presbyterian church and their 
social prominence gains them the entree into the best homes of Vancouver. 
For several years Mr. Tait has been numbered among Vancouver's most 



730 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

prominent and progressive citizens. He may well be termed one of the 
founders of the city, for he has been the promoter of many of its leading 
business enterprises, and the growth and development of a city depend 
upon its commercial and industrial activity. His connection with any un- 
dertaking insures a prosperous outcome of the same, for it is in his nature to 
carry forward to successful completion whatever he is associated with. He 
has earned for himself an enviable reputation as a careful man of business, 
and in his dealings is known for his prompt and honorable methods, which 
have won him the deserved and unbounded confidence of his fellow men. 

GEORGE I. WILSON. 

In noting the salient points in the history of Vancouver, the elements 
that have contributed to its development and have promoted its interests 
along lines of modern progress, it is imi&gt;erative that consideration be given 
those ^^■ho are prominent in connection with the salmon canning industry, 
for this has been one of the chief sources of British Columbia's development, 
especially in its coast districts. Mr. Wilson is secretary and treasurer of 
the British Columbia Packing Association, the largest salmon canning com- 
pany in Cana'da, with headquarters in Vancouver. 

There is no representative of the family in British Columbia save George 
I. Wilson, who was reared -in the land of his nativity, acquiring his early 
education at Fordyce. He entered upon his business career when but four- 
teen years of age, becoming an employe in the general mercantile estab- 
lishment owned by Colonel Moir. He then removed to Edinburgh and ac- 
cepted a position in the store of Dimmic &amp; Guthrie, retail grocers, with 
whom he remained for two years. He then emigrated to New Brunswick 
and accepted a position as traveling salesman with Mann, Byers &amp; Com- 
pany, traveling throughout New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and making 
large sales of dry goods for that house. He formed a wide and favorable 
acquaintance in this way and this step also led to his recognition of an oppor- 
tunity for a business enterprise in Chatham, New Brunswick. There he 
opened a dry goods store on his own account and successfully conducted it 
for fifteen years, constantly enlarging the scope of his labors and increasing 
his stock to meet the growing demands of the trade. In 1887 he came to 
Vancouver and opened the first exclusive dry goods establishment in the 
city. He conducted this business until 1897 and was well known as one 
of its leading merchants, his business enterprise contributing to the general 
commercial prosperity as well as his individual success. In the meantime 



BRITISH COLUMBIA ' 731 

he had extended his efforts to other fields, having become interested in 
the canning business. He was one of the organizers of the Pacific Coast 
Canning Company, with which he was connected for a number of years, 
and he was also interested in the Brunswick Canning Company, being a 
third owner of this plant. He also acted as agent for it and later he became 
owner of the Alliance cannery, while at the formation of the British Co- 
lumbia Packing Association he sold all of his plants to the new corporation. 
He was chosen secretary and treasurer, and in 1893, on the retirement of 
Mr. Doyle, he was also made general manager, which gave him the con- 
trol of its vast industry. This is the largest canning company in Canada, 
with headquarters in Vancouver. 

In 1887 occurred the marriage of Mr. Wilson and Miss Elizabeth J. 
Bain, a native of New Brunswick, and a daughter of Hugh Bain, of Chatham, 
that country. They have had four children, as follows : Hugh, who is 
acting as bookkeeper for the British Columbia Packing Association; Jean, 
Cedric, and Ronald. They are members of St. John's Episcopal church, 
and Mr. Wilson is a past master of a Masonic lodge in New Brunswick. 
He was for seven years a member of the city license board and for nine years 
an active member of the school board of the city, while since its organization 
he has been a valued member of the Board of Trade. 

WILLIAM RALPH. 

Earnest effort, close application and the exercise of his native talents, 
have won for William Ralph a creditable and honorable position in Van- 
couver's business circles, where he is widely known as a prominent hard- 
ware merchant, dealing in stoves, house furnishings, furnaces and steel 
metal work. He was born in Goodrich, Ontario, on the 4th of December, 
i860, and is descended from Scotch and Irish ancestry. His paternal grand- 
father, Robert Ralph, on leaving his native country, became a resident of 
Canada in 1830, and his son, John Ralph, was born in London, Ontario. 
The latter married Miss Elizabeth Ross, who was born in Ingersoll, Onta- 
rio, and is of Scotch lineage, her father, Edmund Ross, having emigrated 
to Canada in 1830. She was reared in the Presbyterian faith, while Mr. 
Ralph was reared in the Church of England. In order to provide for his 
family he conducted a hardware business and was for some years an active 
and enterprising merchant of Goodrich, Ontario. Unto him and his wife 
were born seven children, of whom three daughters and three sons are living, 
namely: Marian Grace, who became the wife of James Galloway and re- 
sides in Nanaimo; Eva Margaret, a resident of Vancouver; Elizabeth, the 



732 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

wife of Dr. Wilson; Harold, who resides on a stock ranch forty miles north 
of Medicine Hat ; and two who are not residents of British Columbia. 

William Ralph was educated in his native town as a public-school stu- 
dent and became familiar with the hardware business under the direction of 
his father. On leaving home he worked as a journeyman in Detroit, St. 
Louis and St. Paul, and for a year and a half occupied the position of fore- 
man with the firm of Vair &amp; Miller. He became a resident of Vancouver in 
1888 and opened his present hardware store, beginning operations on a 
small scale, but meeting with constantly growing success. He was first 
located on Canal street in a small frame building, and as the town grew and 
his business reached larger dimensions he removed into more commodious 
quarters. Subsequently needing still more room he secured possession of 
the large block at No. 126 Hastings street. The building is twenty-five by 
one hundred and twenty feet, three stories in height, and basement, all of 
which is occupied by his large stock of hardware, stoves, house furnish- 
ings, furnaces and steel metal work. He was first associated with James 
M. O'Tool as a partner, and this relation was maintained for three years, 
when they divided the stock and real estate, and Mr. Ralph has since con- 
ducted business alone, meeting with very favorable success. As his finan- 
cial resources increased he has invested in city property, which has reached 
a much higher valuation owing to the rapid growth and development of 
Vancouver. 

In 1899 Mr. Ralph was united in marriage to Miss Mary Shopland, 
of London, Ontario, a daughter of John Shopland of that city, a mill owner 
and manufacturer there. They have two children, one of whom is living, 
Robert Sinclair Ralph, born in Vancouver. They have a delightful home 
on Burnaby street. Mr. Ralph is a member of the board of trade of his city 
and takes an interest in all that pertains to its welfare, while socially he is 
a valued member of Mount Hermon lodge. No. 7, A. F. &amp; A. M., of Van- 
couver, in which he took his first degree. He is a self-made man, who, 
without any extraordinary family or pecuniary advantages at the commence- 
ment of his career, has battled earnestly and energetically, and by indomit- 
able courage and integrity has achieved both character and fortune. By 
sheer force of will and untiring effort he has worked his way upward and 
is numbered among the leading business men of Vancouver.

CLERMONT LIVINGSTON. 

Clermont Livingston, the chief promoter and the manager of the Tyee 
Copper Company, which is one of the few companies that has developed and 
rriaintained a thoroughly successful copper smelting plant in British Colum- 
bia, is a resident of Duncans, where he is held in high esteem for his broad 
usefulness as a citizen and business man. He has been concerned in several 
enterprises of monumental importance during his career, and the success 
which has uniformly attended his endeavors marks him as a man of unusual 
acumen and executive capacity in the direction of commercial and industrial 
affairs. 

Mr. Livingston was born in Middlesex, England, October 15, 1850, 
his parents, Jasper and Mary (Shuttleworth) Livingston, being deceased. 
He was finely educated in England and in Heidelberg, Germany, and in 
young manhood entered upon a promising and broad business career. For 
twenty-five years he was the owner of a big shipping house in London, and 
was also interested in mining in South Africa. When copper was discov- 
ered in paying quantities in British Columbia in 1897, he at once examined 
the possibilities and determined to develop the industry in this province. For 
this purpose he started a development company, out of which has since 
grown the Tyee Copper Company, which he organized as a development 
company in January, 1899. He then returned to England and financed the 
concern, and in 1900 was organized the Tyee Copper Company upon its 
present basis. Capital for the establishment of a local smelter was obtained 
in 1901, and the smelter was completed and began operations in January, 
1903, although steady shipments of ore began in September, 1902. The 
mines have since paid large dividends, and the Tyee has the distinction of 
being the first paying copper property to be developed in British Columbia. 

COLONEL THOMAS O. TOWNLEY. 

Varied have been the interests in the life record of Lieutenant Colonel 
Thomas Owen Townley. Military and political service have divided his 
time and also attention to the practice of law, and his connection with the 
public affairs of Vancouver has been of acknowledged benefit to the city. 
Born in Newmarket, Ontario, on the i8th of August, 1862, Colonel Town- 
ley is descended from ancestry of Lancaster, England, and the family rec- 
ord can be traced far back in the history of that country. His father, John 
Townley, was born in Lancaster and in early manhood emigrated to Can- 
ada. He became a merchant, enterprising and progressive in his business 



734 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

life, and through his well directed lalwrs winning creditable success. He 
was married in Montreal, Canada, to Miss Alice Dixon, also a native of 
Lancaster, England. The}' were valued members of the Church of Eng- 
land and in that faith reared their family, numbering six children, all of 
whom are still living. The family circle, however, was broken by the haftd 
of death in 1867, when the husband and father was called to his final rest. 
His wife still survives him and now resides in Vancouver, in 1904, in the 
seventy-fourth year of her age, making her home with her son, J. D. Town- 
ley, assistant superintendent of the Canadian Pacific railroad. 

Colonel Townley having acquired a good preliminary education, con- 
tinued his studies in Trinity University of Toronto, Canada, from which 
institution he was graduated in 1882, winning the degree of Bachelor of 
Arts. He then went to Winnipeg, where he studied law, and in 1885 was 
admitted to the bar. He then entered upon practice and continued a resident 
of Winnipeg until 1888, when he came to Vancouver, opening an office in 
this city for the prosecution of his profession. His ability was soon recog- 
nized, and in 1889 he was appointed registrar of titles for the New West- 
minster district, occupying that position in a creditable manner until 1903, 
when he resigned in order to again enter upon the practice of law. In 1901 
he was elected mayor of Vancouver and filled this position of trust and 
responsibility for one term. It was during his incumbency that the Prince 
and Princess of Wales visited the city and he had the high honor as mayor 
of Vancouver to receive them in his official capacity and deliver the recep- 
tion address. This was one of the most important and enjoyable events 
that has ever occurred in the city, and Colonel Townley discharged the du- 
ties that devolved upon him on this occasion with honor to himself and 
credit to the citizens of Vancouver. His military service covered ten years' 
connection with the militia, during which time he was promoted to the rank, 
of lieutenant colonel, but he resigned in 1896. 

In 1886 occurred the marriage of Colonel Townley and Miss Frances 
M. Roe, a native of Newmarket, Canada, and a daughter of William Roe, 
who was of English ancestry. Six children have been born unto them : 
Fred Laughton, Evelyn Roe, Lawrence, Edith Emily, Max Mingaye and 
Philip Ford. The parents are members of the Church of England and 
have a beautiful home in Vancouver, where they are numbered among the 
city's most highly esteemed residents. Fraternally Colonel Townley is con- 
nected with Cascade lodge. No. '12, A. F. &amp; A. M., and he is also a member 
of the Order of Eagles and the Order of Foresters. In no calling to which 
man gives his attention does success depend more largely upon individual 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 735 

effort than the law, and that Colonel Townley has achieved distinction in 
the field of jurisprudence at once attests his superior ability and close appli- 
cation. A man of sound judgment, he manages his cases with masterly skill 
and tact; is a logical reasoner and has a ready command of English. His 
powers as an advocate have been demonstrated by his success on many oc- 
casions, and he is an able lawyer of large and varied experience in all the 
courts. Thoroughness characterizes all his efforts and he conducts all his 
business with a strict regard to a high standard of professional ethics. 

CHRISTOPHER MORLEY. 

Christopher Morley is one of the pioneers of 1862 to British Columbia, 
and his career since that year has been of varying prosperity during the first 
part, but of recent years he has attained to rank among the successful and 
worthy business men of Victoria, and is a citizen of known integrity and 
business capacity among all his friends and business associates. In busi- 
ness circles he is widely known in Victoria, as also in other parts of the 
province, as a manufacturer of soda water and other temperance drinks, and 
his own energ\' and business acumen have gone into this enterprise and 
broadened his trade to large proportions. 

Mr. Morley is a native of Leicestershire, England, where he was born 
March 7, 1841. He is of good English stock, and is the only member of 
this branch of the family in British Columbia. He is one of the many who 
were attracted out to this coast country by the highly colored stories of gold 
di.coveries. His faith had accepted these Eldorado pictures at their face 
value, and he came out here expecting to pick up gold under the trees as one 
would gather up fruit. So that as soon as he reached the country he began 
mining, and in a few days his disillusionment was complete — to get gold 
metnt the hardest and roughest kind of labor, and then only in quantities 
\^hich paid no more than ordinary manual toil. But if there is one charac- 
teristic more prominent in Mr. Morley's nature than another, it is a hope- 
ful energy that cannot be cast down by one defeat, and so, not in the least 
discouraged by this one experience, he turned his attention to anything 
which would gain him an honest dollar. He cut cord-wood and worked 
out by the month for wages of twenty-five dollars a month, with board thrown 
in. Then he got work in a soda-water manufactory. He continued at this 
long enough to learn the business thoroughly and by saving his money he 
was able to buy out the partner of Mr. John K. Greenwood and take a per- 
sonal part in the business. This partnership continued for several years, 
■and then Mr. Morley bought out his partner and has since conducted the 



736 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

enterprise alone. He built and is the owner of the nice structure in the busi- 
ness center of Victoria in which he carries on his manufactures. There is 
a large and increasing demand for his products both in Victoria and other 
places of the province, and his goods are well known, both by name and by 
quality. He keeps two wagons busy in the delivery and shipping of the 
products, and has four employes in the establishment. 

Mr. Morley is a member of the Pioneer Society, and for a time served 
as its treasurer. His religious faith is that of the Church of England. He 
has lived a life of single blessedness, and by this course he feels that he has 
escaped much anxiety and trouble, and has retained to distribute among 
friends and associates the genial warmth of nature which would otherwise 
have adorned the domestic hearth. 

JOHN PITCAIRNS ELFORD. 

John Pitcairns Elford, who is connected with one of the leading pro- 
ductive industries of Victoria, and is also well known as a promoter of the 
city's best interests, serving at the present time as one of its aldermen, was 
born in Adelaide, New South Wales, on the loth of March, 185 1, and is of 
English lineage. His father, Robert Elford, was born in Plymouth, Eng- 
land, removed to south Australia and in 1848 was married to Miss Hannah 
Taylor. When their little son, the subject of this review, was but three 
months old they started for California and at Pitcairns Island he was 
christened, hence his middle name. At length the vessel reached the har- 
bor of San Francisco, and the captain, sailors and passengers all left the ship, 
which with others which were also abandoned because of the mad rush for 
the gold fields, now lies buried in the sand and sea at the foot of Montgom- 
ery street. Mr. Elford went to the gold diggings in Grass valley and later 
he obtained two hundred acres of land from the government near San Rafael, 
which he improved and farmed, but the Spaniards had so many bull fights 
and other characteristic amusements that Mrs. Elford refused to stay there 
and rear her children under such influences, so they removed to Petaluma, 
where Mr. Elford, who was a carpenter and builder, erected the first resi- 
dence in the town, and one of the streets of that place now bears his name. 
He afterward engaged in contracting and building in San Francisco and 
there remained until 1858, when he came to Victoria. 

The following year Mr. Elford returned to California for his family, 
whom he brought with him to British Columbia. He had been in the Cari- 
boo and had met with fair success. Upon his return to the province he once 
more made his way to the Cariboo mines, where he had a valuable claim on 



BRITISH COLUMBIA T3T 

Williams creek. He was also one of the first to go to the Omonico and also 
to Cassiar, but in his later mining ventures he was not very successful, and 
abandoning his search for gold he resumed buildin-g operations, becoming a 
contractor and builder of Victoria, where he erected many substantial struct- 
ures, securing a liberal patronage. Finally he retired altogether from active 
business life and resided in his comfortable home until his death, which oc- 
curred when he was seventy-seven years of age. His wife had previously 
passed away. She had been a devoted wife and mother, a noble pioneer 
woman and a most faithful companion and helpmate to her husband, and from 
her loss he nev^er seemed to recover, his health gradually failing until he, 
too, passed away. One of their sons, Theophilus, resides in California ; 
Carl is manager of the Shanagan I^ke Sawmill Company. Caroline is now 
the wife of William Archibald, manager of the Canadian Pacific railway tel- 
egraph office at Nanaimo; Mary Letitia resides at Petaluma, California, and 
is the wife of Luther Cullen. 

John P. Elford, whose name introduces this review, acquired his edu- 
cation in Victoria and San Francisco and in early life learned the carpen- 
ter's trade, which he followed in the latter city, being connected with build- 
ing operations there from 1868 until 1872. He then returned to Victoria, 
where he followed carpentering until 1875. In 1886 he entered into part- 
nership with W. J. Smith and they established the Queen City brickyard, 
which has been a growing enterprise, returning to -the owners an excellent 
profit on their investment. For several years Mr. Elford did a large amount 
of contracting and building and was connected with the erection of many of 
the best structures of the city, including the postgffice building, the Duard 
hotel, the Jubilee hospital and others, but his attention is now principally 
devoted to the manufacture of red brick, for which he has a large sale, both 
in Victoria and Vancouver. He has been very successful in his business and 
is the o\\ner of several dwelling houses, other city property and land in dif- 
ferent parts of the province, having made judicious investment in real estate. 
His business is large and constantly growing. It has been developed along 
modern lines and in conformity with the strictest commercial ethics, and it 
has become one of the more prominent productive industries of the city. 

In his political views Mr. Elford is independent and liberal. He is now 
serving as alderman of Victoria and is on the sanitary, electric lights and 
railway committees. He is a Royal Arch Mason and for more than twenty 
years he has been a meml^er of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. 

Mr. Elford was married in 1875 to Miss Hettie Robertson, the eldest 
•daughter of Captain John Robertson, of Cleveland, Ohio, but after two years 



738 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of happy married life she was taken from him by death. Two years later 
Mr. Elford married Agnes Francis Secord, daughter of H. A. Lilley, of 
Maple Bay, British Columbia. They have two children, John Herbert and 
Mary Essie, who is now the wife of George Lilley. Mrs. Elford is a mem- 
ber of the Methodist church and Mr. Elford gives his support to that church. 
They have a pleasant home in Victoria and their circle of friends is almost 
co-extensive with the circle of their acquaintance. 

COMMERCIAL HOTEL. 

Perhaps no other business interest so clearly demonstrates the standing 
of a town or city as does the hotel, for the enterprise and industry of its 
commercial life is indicated here, and the traveling public who have to do 
with its commercial affairs demand certain qualities of entertainment. Few 
cities of its size afford as elegant hotel accommodations as does the Com- 
mercial. Metropolitan in its appointments, perfect in its equipments and 
conveniences, and supplied with many luxuries that add to the comfort of 
its guests, this well known hostelry has found favor with the public and is 
accorded a very liberal patronage. 

The Commercial Hotel is situated on Cambie street, between Cordova 
and Hastings. It covers a ground space of thirty-two by one hundred and 
fifty feet, and is a substantial brick structure, five stories in height with 
basement. It contains fifty-six rooms, the first floor being occupied by the 
office and bar, the latter also occupying a part of the Flack Block, and it is 
the finest in British Columbia. The hotel is conducted on the American 
plan exclusively, and has a large and representative patronage. 

A. PRESCOTT, one of the proprietors of the Commercial Hotel, was 
born in England, and on coming to the United States in 1872 took up his 
abode in Cleveland, Ohio. In that city he engaged in the ship-building 
business, and from that place went to Chicago and continued the same line 
of trade for one year. On the expiration of that period, in 1876, he removed 
to California, first establishing his home in Oakland and later in Alameda, 
and continued his ship-building operations. For twenty years he was thus 
engaged, and at the close of that long period returned to Chicago to super- 
intend the construction of two car ferries for the Wisconsin-Michigan Rail- 
road. Returning thence to California, he went to St. Michaels in 1895 to 
erect a stern wheel boat for the Alaska Commercial Company. Mr. Pres- 
cott next came to British Columbia, and for James Dursinund superintended 
the construction of a car ferry to run from Vancouver to Comox, after 
which he took two car loads of cattle, eight hundred head, to Skagway and

returned. He then went into the hotel business as proprietor of the Com- 
mercial, and in addition also owns the Windsor House and has business 
property on Greenville street and North Vancouver. He does everything 
in his power for the comfort and convenience of his guests, and is widely 
recognized as one of Vancouver's enterprising business men. 

WILLIAM D. HAYWOOD, prominently connected with the hotel 
interests of Vancouver as one of the proprietors of the Commercial, was 
born on Prince Edward Island May 13, i860, a son of George H. and Mar- 
garet (Donald) Haywood, both still living on Prince Edward Island. After 
completing his education in the public schools of his native place William D. 
engaged in railroading, in the passenger and freight department of the 
Prince Edward Island Railroad. In 1880 he went to Colorado and secured 
work on the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad, and five years later, in 1885, 
came to British Columbia and engaged in carpentering. After the mem- 
orable fire he again embarked in railroading, securing employment with the 
Canadian Pacific Railroad Company, with whom he remained for one year. 
Coming thence to Vancouver, Mr. Haywood was for one year on the police 
force, and in 1889 identified himself with the hotel business. In 1898 he 
purchased the Commercial Hotel, of which he has since been one of the 
popular and esteemed proprietors. 

In 1893, in San Francisco, California, Mr. Haywood was united in 
marriage to Cassie, a daughter of George Squarebriggs, of Prince Edward 
Island, and they have one daughter, Georgie. In his social relations Mr. 
Haywood is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and polit- 
ically is a Liberal, while his religious preference is indicated by his mem- 
bership in the Presbyterian church. He owns both business and residence 
property in Vancouver. The comfort and conveniences which he affords 
his guests, his courteous treatment of them and his earnest desire to please 
have secured to him a very liberal patronage and won him the regard of the 
traveling public. 

DONALD MALCOLM STEWART. 

D. M. Stewart, who is filling the position of alderman for his ward 
for a second tenn, having been first elected to this position for the council 
of 1904, is a native of Glengary county, Ontario, born March i, 1862. As 
his name implies, Mr. Stewart is of Scottish lineage, his father, Norman 
Stewart, having emigrated from Scotland in 18 18. The elder Stewart took 
up the occupation of farming, and members of his family still follow the 
same calling on the old homestead. D. M. Stewart pursued his education in 



740 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

the schools of his native county, and afterwards served his apprenticeship 
in a general store in Dunvegan. Having heard of the wonderful possibili- 
ties of the Great West Land, Mr. Stewart decided to follow the setting sun 
to where it dips into the broad Pacific. He arrived in Vancouver in 1889, 
but not finding congenial occupation he drifted southward and spent the 
next two years in Seattle, Tacoma and Bellingham. The land of his na- 
tivity had greater attractions for him, however, and he returned to Van- 
couver in 1891. Shortly after his arrival he purchased the Pioneer Steam 
Laundry (which was then but a very small concern) and devoted his ener- 
gies to building up a business which has assumed such proportions as not 
only to be the largest of its kind in British Columbia, but one of the largest 
on the Pacific Coast. Mr. Stewart is prominent in church affairs, being a 
Presbyterian in faith, is a Liberal in politics and takes a deep interest in all 
matters affecting the welfare of the community in which he resides. 

W. H. PRICE. 

W. H. Price is the owner of the Price Preserving Company at Vic- 
toria, a business which during the ten years of his management has had a 
phenomenal success and growth, and its products are familiar articles of 
daily consumption in thousands of homes in this province and throughout 
the northwest. Mr. Price is a man of fine executive ability, became a mas- 
ter of his chosen business, and has since followed it up in a manner to re- 
flect credit upon himself and the general spirit of enterprise of this city. 

This business was established in Victoria in 1887 by Okell and Morris 
Fruit Preserving and Confectionery Company, who manufactured the Gold 
Medal brand of preserves, confectionery, pickles, sauces and vinegars. In 
1891 this firm entered into a contract with Mr. Price by which he was to 
come out to Victoria and take entire charge of the business. Mr. Price was 
lx)rn, reared and educated in England, and had learned in a most thorough 
manner the confectionery business in all its departments, so that he was well 
qualified to perform his part of such a contract, and his reputation in this 
line had indeed already been made. While in England he had succeeded in 
securing for the firm with which he was employed for several years the 
medals offered for preserves at the National Confectionery Exhibition at 
London, and from the beginning of his career his enterprising efforts and 
ambition to excel have placed him in the front rank of this class of manu- 
facturers. 

Mr. Price assumed active management of the Victoria business in 1894, 
and after conducting it successfully for seven years bought out the owners 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 741 

of the establishment and has since carried it on according to his own high 
ideals and with such success that his trade now extends to most of the 
towns of British Columbia and other portions of the northwest. He has 
placed his goods on exhibition year after year and has received some twenty 
gold and silver medals besides numerous diplomas showing how highly his 
products are esteemed by competent judges. The goods of the Price Pre- 
serving Company are of equal or superior quality to all similar goods man- 
ufactured anywhere in the world. Mr. Price's motto is "The Purest and 
Best," and anyone who understands the care and scientific skill which char- 
acterize every^ department of the industry will agree that the excellence of 
his products corresponds with his business motto. The Gold Medal brand 
of preserved fruit sets the standard of purity and grade, and it is not to be 
wondered at that his business has increased from year to year and has be- 
come an important factor in the permanent prosperity of Victoria. 

Since his arrival in Victoria, Mr. Price has shown himself to be more 
than a business man, and by his activity in public affairs has materially aided 
in the growth and civic welfare of the city. He held the office of police 
commissioner for two years, and takes an intelligent and influential partici- 
pation in all political questions. He is an active member of the British Co- 
lumbia Agricultural Society, being a member of its Ixjard of managers. Fra- 
ternally he is a Royal Arch Mason, and is past president of the Sons of St. 
George and now grand messenger for the Pacific coast jurisdiction. 

In 1885 he was married in England to Miss Emma Sligaby, who was 
born in that country. Their four children are as follows : Joseph Arthur, 
who is with his father in business ; and George Henry, Annie and Emma, at 
home. Mrs. Price died in 1893, and Mr. Price married for his present wife 
Miss Marion Baun, a native of England. They have three children, Vic- 
toria, Stanley and Flora May. Mr. and Mrs. Price are members of the 
Church of England. 

WILLIAM J. McMillan. 

William J. McMillan, classed with Vancouver's pioneer settlers and 
business men, has watched the entire development of the city where he is 
now prominently and successfully engaged in the wholesale grocery busi- 
ness as a member of the firm of W. J. McMillan &amp; Company, his associate 
in the enterprise being his brother, Robert J. McMillan. A native of New 
Brunswick, William J. McMillan was born on the 26th of June, 1858, and 
is descended from an old Scotch family. His father, James McMillan, was 
born in Scotland and came with his father, John McMillan, from the land 



742 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

of the heather to New Brunswick, being then in his tenth year. He was 
reared to manhood in the latter place and was married there to Miss May 
Cook, who was born in the same neighborhood in which her husband's birth 
had occurred. They became the parents of eleven children, eight of whom 
are now living. 

William J. McMillan was educated in his native town and came to 
the Pacific coast in 1880, making his way to Sacramento, California, where 
he had a brother living. For a time he engaged in farming in that locality 
and afterward went to Portland, Oregon, where he was engaged in rail- 
roading in connection with the Oregon Railway &amp; Investigation Company. 
In 1883 he came to British Columbia, going first to Victoria, where he 
worked on the Island railroad. Later he came to Vancouver, arriving here 
the day after the great fire. He found the latter place in ashes, but it has 
risen Phoenix-like from the ruins. The following year he opened a prod- 
uce and fruit store, and his business has developed with the marvelous 
growth of the town until it has now reached very extensive dimensions. His 
first partner was R. J. Hanlan, an own cousin of Mr. McMillan, but later 
the latter purchased Mr, Hanlan's interest and at the present time is asso- 
ciated with his brother, Robert, under the firm style of W. J. McMillan &amp; 
Company. Through his honorable methods, careful direction and unfalter- 
ing enterprise his business has grown until he is now conducting a success- 
ful grocery house, shipping goods to Dawson and various points in the 
northwest. 

In 1890 Mr. McMillan was joined in wedlock to Miss Laura E. Horn, 
a native of England and a daughter of H. F. Horn. They have six chil- 
dren: Laura May, Wiilliam Henry James, John Douglas, Alida Ruth, 
Celia Mary and Charles Robert, all born in Vancouver. Mr. McMillan has 
secured a commodious and pleasant home for his family and the members 
of the household occupy an enviable social position. They are Presbyterians 
in religious faith, and Mr. McMillan is a very active member of the Inde- 
pendent Order of Foresters and lias most acceptably filled the various posi- 
tions in the local lodge. He has always been zealous for the prosperity of 
Vancouver, is a member of the board of trade and is serving on the freight 
rates committee, in which capacity he has done valuable work for the ship- 
ping interests of this section of the country. He is ever ready to champion 
any cause that will improve the business conditions of Vancouver or add to 
its intellectual, moral and political development, and he stands today as a 
representative of that class whose labors have been the essential factors in 
the upuilding of the province.

HARRIE G. ROSS. 

Harrie G. Ross, proprietor of one of the foremost grocery establish- 
ments of Victoria, and a young and progressive citizen who has already made 
his influence felt in several ways for the commercial and public welfare of 
the city, is a native son of Victoria, where he was born May 3, 1874, and 
since he came to years of manhood he has identified himself closely and 
usefully with the best interests of his home city. 

The store of which Mr. Ross is the present proprietor was formerly the 
property of his honored father, Dixi H. Ross, who founded the business in 
this city. Dixi H. Ross came to this province in 1870, and continued his 
residence here throughout most of the subsequent years of his life. A native 
of the state of Pennsylvania, born in the town of Cambridge in 1842, of 
old English ancestry, Dixi Ross came to Victoria without independent means, 
and his first work was as a clerk in a grocery establishment. He then went 
to the Cariboo district and took charge of his uncle's business at Cotton- 
wood. On his return to Victoria in 1873 he established the present grocery 
house, which has accordingly had a continuous and successful existence of 
over thirty years. His first partner was Mr. Cameron, and together they 
carried on a wholesale trade for a time. Somewhat later Mr. Newfelder 
bought out Mr. Cameron, and in 1878, on the former's removal to Seattle, 
Mr, D. H. Ross became the sole owner of the business, and it was carried 
on with increased success until his death. Dixi H. Ross married a lady 
from his native town of Cambridge. Pennsylvania, Miss Lucy O. Birchard, 
and she came to British Columbia soon after the wedding. They were the 
parents of three children, and the two living are Harriet, now Mrs. H. 
Goulding Wilson, of Victoria, and Harrie, who is the successor of his father 
in business. 

Reared and educated in Victoria, Mr. Ross has practically spent all his 
active life in connection with the grocery business. His father died on 
July 20, 1899, and since then he has had entire charge of the store, in which 
time he has enlarged the scope of the business in accordance with the trend 
of modern commercial enterprises. In 1900, in order to have more room, he 
moved to his present location, where he has an elegant situation and a hand- 
some store, equipped with as complete a stock of groceries and wines and 
liquors as can be found in the entire city. The business has grown con- 
stantly since its inception, and as a cash store it has an immense trade in 
the city. 



744 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr. Ross afifiliates with the Masonic fraternity and with the Ancient 
Order of United Workmen, and his father was hkewise a member of these 
orders. 

THOMAS OVENS. 

Thomas Ovens, proprietor of extensive machine shop and carriage works, 
owner of large amount of business and real estate property, prominent in 
public and business affairs and altogether one of the most substantial and 
prosperous citizens of New Westminster, came to the province of British 
Columbia in 1870 and for the past thirty-five years has been uninterruptedly 
active in the various phases of his life work. 

Of English and Irish ancestry and a native of the city of Liverpool, 
where he was born on December 4, 1844, Mr. Ovens received a good edu- 
cation and then became an apprentice to the blacksmith and machinist's trade. 
For the privilege of learning the trade he paid a premium of ten pounds, 
and as a result of his work during the first year he received a compensation 
of two shillings six pence a week. This wage was increased from year to 
year, but in the last twelve months of his service he was paid but twelve 
shillings a week. As a journeyman he went to work for one Mathew Wil- 
son in Whitechapel, Liverpool, where as foreman he received thirty-four 
shillings a week, and continued at that for two years. He then went into 
business on his own account, opening a job and machine shop and conduct- 
ing it with excellent success. He then went to Manchester, England, and 
became manager for Henry Moore, on Oxford street, which position he held 
for three and a half years. In the meantime he had been happily married, 
but within a brief period he was bereaved of both wife and little daughter, 
and under such a weight of sorrow he felt compelled to seek a change of 
scenes. This led him to America, and from the Atlantic side he crossed the 
plains to San Francisco, where he went to work for the Risdon machine 
works. A short time later, in 1870, he arrived in this province. 

Mr. Ovens' first business enterprise here was in the fish industry, and 
for some seven years he was among the successful pioneers in that work. 
It is noteworthy that he took the medal at the Centennial at Philadelphia 
for the best exhibit of canned salmon. During this time he and his partner 
gave employment to some three hundred men and made use of twenty-five 
fishing boats. They manufactured their own cans, all made by hand work. 
Their success was large and continuous up to the last year of their prosecu- 
tion of the industry. 

After leaving this industry Mr. Ovens went to the Coquahalla moun- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 745 

tains and spent a season in placer mining. He then became an engineer on 
the construction work of. the Canadian Pacific railroad, assisting in the build- 
ing of that road through a part of the Yale district. He then returned to 
New Westminster and established the blacksmith and machine shops which he 
is still conducting. In these shops all kinds of mechanical job work are 
done, much steamboat refitting and repairing, and an extensive manufacture 
of wagons and carriages. A three-story building is required to accommodate 
the shops. Mr. Ovens has done a large amount of building in the city. 
His own home is in a neat cottage on the hill above the town, whence a fine 
view may be obtained of the city and Fraser river and the forest ]&gt;eyond. 
He owns twelve lots in this beautiful location. Mr. Ovens also has a brick 
bl&lt;^ck in the business part of the city. 

Mr. Ovens is a Conservative in politics, and thoroughly public-spirited 
in all his actions pertaining to the civic welfare. For a number of years he 
served his city as alderman, and was its honorable mayor for two years. He 
has been behind many of the movements for promoting the material progress 
of the city, and nothing for the benefit of his community lacks his influence 
and su]}port. He is also well known in fraternal circles, being affiliated w-ith 
King Solomon's lodge. No. 17, A. F. &amp; A. M., with the Knights of Pythias 
and with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and has membership with 
the Amalgamated Smiths and Machinists of England, one of the largest in- 
dustrial societies in the world. His religious connections are with the 
Church of England. For many years he has been honored with the ofiice of 
justice of the peace for the Westminster election district. 

Since the death of his first wife Mr. Ovens has never sought a second 
companion. Mrs. Ovens w^as Miss Ruth Susanna Rowe, a native of Liver- 
pool, and she died at the birth of her daughter. This only child was soon 
after taken away from him by scarlet fever. 

WILLIAM HENRY LADNER. 

William Henry Ladner, of Ladner, is one of the most distinguished 
of the British Columbia pioneers who still survive the passage of time. He 
has been actively concerned in the affairs of the province for nearly half a 
century, and in the course of this time material prosperity, civic honors and 
the lasting esteem and respect of his fellow men have rewarded him in 
abundant measure. 

A native of Cornwall, England, Mr. Ladner was born nearly eighty 
years ago, on November 28, 1826. His parents were Edward and Sarah 
(Ellis) Ladner, both natives of Cornwall, his father a farmer, who came to 



746 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

America in 1847 ^^^^^ farmed in the state of Wisconsin until his deatli in 
1 85 1. There were six children in the family, and the living brothers and 
sisters of Mr. Ladner are Mrs. Hugh Phillips, of Mineral Point, Wisconsin ; 
Mrs. W. J. Armstrong, of New Westminster; and Thomas E., at Ladner 
Landing. 

Mr. Ladner followed his father to the state of Wisconsin in 1848, and 
after remaining there till the fall of 1850 he returned to the old country. 
He again crossed the Atlantic in the following spring, and, spending an- 
other year in Wisconsin, set out in the spring of 1852 across the plains to 
California. He was five months and six days in making the trip from 
Omaha, Nebraska, to Sacramento, California. He remained in California 
until the spring of 1858, when the golden discoveries of the Fraser river 
country attracted him to British Cokmibia. He arrived on the steamer 
Brother Jonathan on May 15, 1858, at Victoria, which was then little more 
than a trading post, and the mainland was absolutely an unbroken wilder- 
ness. The party of six, of whom he was one, built skiffs for passage up 
the Fraser river. They paid fifty dollars for transit to Point Roberts, and 
thence by small boats reached Fort Langley on the last day of May. By 
taking that route they avoided the custom duties at the mouth of the Fraser 
river, there being then a duty of ten per cent on all imported goods and a 
charge of five dollars being made for each mining license. He left Lang- 
ley on the first of June, and on the following Saturday night reached Hope. 
The next Sunday morning he witnessed twO' surprises, a surprise of the 
Indians and the arrival of the American boat Surprise, that being the first 
boat to make the passage up the Fraser river. 

Mr. Ladner took up some mining claims and began doing trading. A 
little later he was appointed customs agent and government officer, having 
the honor of being the first constable appointed on the mainland of the prov- 
ince. As an officer he had some interesting experiences. At one time a 
steamer came up the river and made a stop at Hope, and while he was de- 
coyed and delayed by the official examination of a man who brought from 
the boat a jug which he supposed to be whisky, at the same time there were 
being unloaded on the other side of the steamer two canoes full of whisky, 
and thence it was carried back into the woods and secreted before he could 
get it under his legal authority. The lone jug which he did examine proved 
to be full of water. 

He remained in Hope until the spring of 1859, and then started a pack 
train to the interior, continuing this enterprise until 1865. Freight rates 
were then very high. He got as much as fifty cents for every pound he 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 747 

carried between Yale and Williams creek, exclusive of the road toll, which 
was two cents per pound. From this the reader may easily judge how high 
all commodities were in that part of the country. As another illustration, 
one day he paid seventy-five cents a pound for five pounds of barley for his 
mules; it cost him fifty cents to wash the cobw^ebs out of his throat, and 
his bacon and l^eans were a dollar and a half, so that this meal for himself 
and mules came to an even five dollars. 

After he had tried the packing business in the Big Bend country for 
about a year he lost all he had made, and in 1868 he returned to the prov- 
ince and settled at what is now known as Ladner's landing, or simply Lad- 
ner, where he pre-empted a hundred and sixty acres and later bought four 
hundred and eighty acres, all of which he devoted to agricultural pursuits 
and stock-raising. This line of business has been his chief occupation ever 
since, and through it he has acquired a competence. He is one of the earliest 
pioneers of this section of the province, and has been very prominent in 
agricultural, commercial and public afifairs. 

Mr. Ladner is a member of the Pioneer Society of British Columbia. 
He has taken an active part in politics, being a staunch Conservative, and 
he represented the New Westminster district in the provincial parliament 
from 1886 to 1890. He has been reeve of Delta almost continually since 
1880, has held a commission as justice of the peace since 1872, and has 
been police magistrate for the municipality of Delta for the past fifteen years. 

In the spring of 1865 Mr. Ladner married Miss Mary A. Booth, who 
was a native of the state of Iowa. She died in 1879, and the four children 
surviving their marriage are Ida Harriet, Sarah Louise, wife of Fred Howay, 
Paul Edward, and Delta Mary, wife of W. J. Watson, of Ladysmith. In 
1880 Mr. Ladner married for his present wife Mrs. McLellan, of Clinton, 
British Columbia. 

REGINALD A. UPPER. 

Reginald A. Upper, whose public-spirited citizenship has been a reliable 
influence for the welfare of Revelstoke during his ten years' residence there, 
and who is now the incumbent of one of the important administrative of- 
fices of the district, was born in Dunville, Ontario, in 1875. His parents, 
Martin Campbell and Louise (Cook) Upper, are both natives of the Do- 
minion, and his father for thirteen years held the honored place of judge of 
the county of Haldemand, where the parents still reside. 

The grammar schools oi Dun-ville and the high school at Cayuga fur- 
nished Mr. Upper his educational equipment. He left school at the age of 



748 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

eighteen, and in the following year, 1894, came west to British Columbia, 
since which time his lot has httn mainly cast with that of Revelstoke. Dur- 
ing- 1895-96 he prospected in the Kootenay mining district, and from 1897 
to 1900 he was proprietor of a first class hotel at Revelstoke. In August, 
1900. he received appointment as provincial police and chief license inspector 
for the Revelstoke riding of the West Kootenay district, and in a most satis- 
factory and capable manner has performed the duties of this office up to 
the present time. 

In 1902 Mr. Upper married Miss Selma Turnrose. Her father, Charles 
Turnrose, was an honored pioneer of the town of Revelstoke. Mr. and 
Mrs. Upper have two children, Walter and Reginald, Jr. Fraternally Mr. 
Upper affiliates with Kootenay Lodge No. 15, of the Masonic order. 

SAMUEL MELLARD. 

Samuel Mellard, postmaster at Chilliwack, is also one of the foremost 
business men of this town, a man of prominence in all life's relations, and 
has given his influence and effort to the advancement and general welfare 
of the province since leaving his native land and taking up his residence in 
this part of America. He has been successful in private business affairs, 
and has also been intrusted with many responsibilities of a public nature, 
all of which he has borne in a manner to reflect the highest credit upon his 
worth and usefulness as a public-spirited citizen. 

Born at Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, September 24, 1854, a son of 
Thomas and Mary (Wood) Mellard, both of whom are now deceased, he 
was educated in the grammar school of Newcastle, and was then articled 
to the hardware trade, at which he served his full time. He then moved to 
Bedford, near London, and was in the same employment there for ten years. 
He was a man of considerable business experience and mature ability when 
he came to Chilliwack in 1887, and has ever since been prominently identi- 
fied with the business and civic affairs of the town. He started a hardware 
store, and in the same year was appointed postmaster, a position which he 
has held ever since. He was appointed notary public for the province in 
1890, having previous to then been notary for the district. He has served 
as treasurer of municipality, and also of the Chilliwack Agricultural Society, 
At the present writing he is registrar of marriages, is commissioner of affi- 
davits for the supreme court of the province, and is justice of the peace for 
the district; has been secretary of the school board since June, 1893, and 
is interested in all departments of publfc progress and prosperity. He is 
the representative of ChilliAvack of several old-line life insurance companies.

April i6, 1881, Mr. Mellard was married to Miss Katharine Alice Webb, 
a daughter of Thomas Webb, of Marston, Bedfordshire, England. Their 
three children are Carrie Elsie, wife of Henry i\yres, of southern Califor- 
nia; Edith Lillian; and Constance Louise, wife of John W. McGillivray. 
Mr. Mellard is a charter member and a past master of Ionic Lodge No. 19, 
A. F. &amp; A. M. ; is a member of Westminster Royal Arch Chapter No. 124. 
He is a past grand of Excelsior Lodge No. 9, 1. O. O. P., and is a mem- 
ber of the Sons of England. The religious connections of the family are 
with the Church of England. Mr. Mellard was one of the first men to 
engage in business on the present townsite, and has witnessed many changes 
during this time, having practically grown up with the town. 

WTLLLVM GOSNELL. 

William Gosnell, of the Nelson Brewing Company, Limited, widely 
known in business and social circles of the Kootenays, and a man of broad 
experience in the affairs of the world, was born in 1858, in the province 
of Quebec, where also were born both his parents, Edward and Anne 
(Smyth) Gosnell. 

He received a public school education in the city of Quebec, at the age 
of twelve going with his parents to the province of Ontario. He became 
connected in business relations with his father, who was a lime manufac- 
turer, and he remained in Ontario conducting a lime kiln until 1895. In 
that year he went to South Africa, where he followed contracting and under- 
took various enterprises, with considerable success. He returned from 
Johannesburg in 1897 and came out to British Columbia. After a short 
time spent at Rossland he located at Nelson, which has been his home and 
center of business activity ever since. He established what was known as 
the Castle Brewery, and operated this plant until October, 1904, at which 
time an mcorporation of the brewing interests of the city was effected, his 
brewery being consolidated with the Nelson Brewery and the Riesterer 
Brewery, the latter being the pioneer concern of the kind in the Kootenays. 
The interests are now conducted under the name of Nelson Brewing Com- 
pany, Limited, and the plant has a daily capacity of fifty barrels of highest 
class beer, which product is distributed throughout the Kootenay region. 

Mr. Gosnell is prominently identified with the Fraternal Order of 
Eagles, having been a delegate to the grand eyre at Vancouver in 1900, at 
Seattle in 1899, at San Francisco in 1901 and at New York city in 1903.

CHARLES T. COONEY. 

Charles T. Cooney, of Kamloops, is one of the most interesting pioneer 
characters of eastern British Columbia, and among the early settlers living at 
the present time he holds almost the palm of priority in reaching the mining 
district of the Cariboo and Kootenay, where his career of active usefulness 
has since been spent. Although an eager seeker after mineral wealth dur- 
ing the first years of his residence in the province, he has now for forty years 
been almost solely occupied in ranching, and it is not too much to state 
that he is one of the most prosperous of that class of men in the vicinity of 
Kamloops. He specializes on high grade stock, and his ranch impresses one 
as a model of its kind, both in extent and variety of its operations and in, 
its care and management. 

Of excellent Irish parentage and nativity, Mr. Cooney was born in 
Kings county of the Emerald Isle in March, 1835, so that he has now at- 
tained the age of three score and ten, although yet being a man of great 
activity and in full enjoyment of his powers. His parents were William 
and Mary (Kelley) Cooney. What early education he received, and it 
was limited in quantity, he obtained in the parochial schools at his birthplace, 
and his rearing was on his father's farm, where industrious habits were 
early instilled into him. 

At the age of sixteen he and his brother John came to America, the 
first year being spent in work in a tannery in Johnstown, Fulton county. 
New York. He went to Canada in 1852, and spent two years in what was 
then known as Lower Canada. On his return to the United States he be- 
came connected with a surveying party at St. Paul, Minnesota, and was 
engaged in railroad work until the fall of 1857. 

In 1857 the Eraser river gold excitement had spread eastward and was 
attracting hundreds to the then little known province of British Columbia. 
Mr. Cooney joined a party of forty-two men bound for the new diggings, 
and, leaving St. Paul in the fall of 1857, it was the last of November, 1858, 
when he arrived in Kamloops, having passed through a variety of experi- 
ences in reaching the scene of his future life work. After leaving St. Paul 
the first point of civilization' which the party struck was Eort Garry, Mon- 
tana, and thence the route lay through Portage la Prairie, Fort Ellis, Carle- 
ton, and after crossing the mountains into British Columbia they followed 
the Kootenay river for many days; they crossed the Columbia at Colville 
Valley, and then followed the Kettle river and the Okanogan into Kamloops, 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 751 

at which point the party disbanded and went as each individual chose for 
himself. 

Mr. Cooney, immediately on his arrival, began mining, spending the 
seasons of 1862 and 1863 on Williams creek in the Cariboo district. In 
1865 he started a pack train from Yale into the Cariboo district, and con- 
ducted it until 1869. In the latter year he bought the ranch on which he 
has since made his home. He owns two hundred and seventy-five acres, 
and leases five thousand acres, all of which is under a high state of cultiva- 
tion. His stock is mainly thoroughbred shorthorn and Hereford cattle, and 
the Clydesdale and Percheron horses. Having lived here for so many years, 
he has been a witness of the entire development of the country, whether in- 
dustrially, commercially or socially, and it can be said to his honor that he 
himself has taken no inconsiderable part in that great work of transform- 
ing a new country into an abode of civilization. 

Mr. Cooney married, in 1867, Miss Elizabeth AUar, who was born in 
Fort George, British Columbia. They are the parents of ten children, four 
sons and six daughters, and all have grown up and taken useful and honor- 
able places in the world, thus adhering to the example of their revered par- 
ents. 

JOHN HAMILTON. 

John Hamilton, mayor of Nelson, and connected with the executive 
service of the railroads as agent for the Canadian Pacific &amp; Great Northern 
Railway, was born in St. Marys, Ontario, March 27, 1856, his parents being 
Thomas H. and Isabella (Reid) Hamilton, both of whom have passed away. 
His early education was acquired in the public schools of St. Marys, and 
after putting aside his text books he was employed for a time as a farm 
hand. Subsequently he learned telegraphy and later he secured a position 
with a dry goods house, but subsequently he returned to telegraphy, and 
when the Canadian Pacific Railroad was being built in 1884 he joined its 
forces and acted as telegraph operator in its service until the completion of 
the lines. When the two sections of the railway connected he accepted a 
position as telegraph operator at Griffins, where he spent the winter, and 
in the spring of 1885 he went to Farwell in Revelstoke, where he was engaged 
in a similar line of work. In the fall of 1886 he went to Donald as train 
dispatcher, continuing there until the spring of 1890, when he returned to 
Revelstoke as agent of the road. In the summer of 1891 he came to Nel- 
son to look after the general business of the road and was agent and general 
overseer. He also acted as agent at Rokons and Sproats Landing for a 



752 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

time, and managed the company's stores there. In the fall of 1891 he took 
the agency of the road at Nelson, and has since served in that capacity with 
the exception of a short interval spent as train master. He is both local 
freight and ticket agent for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the 
Great Northern Railway Companies at Nelson, and is a popular official be- 
cause of his courtesy, his earnest desire to please the patrons of the roads and 
his devotion to the niterests of the companies which he represents. 

In 1881 occurred the marriage of Mr. Hamilton and Miss Sarah Block,, 
a resident of Rockwood, Ontario. They had one child, Harry, who' is a 
physician in the General Hospital at Nelson and is now house surgeon. In 
1892 Mr. Hamilton was again married, his second union being with Miss 
Jean Rath, a resident of Belgrade, Ontario. 

Mr. Hamilton is a charter member of Nelson lodge, No. 23, A. F. &amp; A. 
M., acted as its first master and was also the first master of the lodge in 
Revelstoke. In fact he was the organizer of the Masonic lodges in Donald, 
Revelstoke and Nelson, and has thus been well known in the active promo- 
tion of Masonry in the province. His religious faith is that of the Presby- 
terian church. Prominent in community interests he served as alderman 
of Nelson for three years and was so capable that in January, 1904, he was 
elected mayor of the city. He is widely and favorably known throughout 
his section of the province, his abilities well fitting him for leadership in 
political, business and social life. The terms advancement and patriotism 
might be considered an index to his character, for throughout his career 
he has labored for the improvement of every line of business or public in- 
terest with which he has been associated, and at all times has been actuated 
by a fidelity to the province and her welfare. 

THOMAS MADDEN. 

Thomas Madden, the popular proprietor of one of the leading hotels 
of Nelson, whose business career has been characterized by consecutive ad- 
vancement won through earnest application and able effort, was born in 
Quebec, October 15, 1855, ^^is parents being Thomas and Sarah (Connors) 
Madden, both of whom are deceased. The son was a public school student 
in Quebec, and on putting aside his text books he secured employment in 
the lumber camps of that portion of the country. He was afterward en- 
gaged in construction work for the Chicago, American &amp; Baltimore Bridge 
Company in the United States, and also on the Northern Pacific Railroad 
and the St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Manitoba Railroad. Subsequently he be- 
came connected with the surveying department of the Canadian Pacific

Railroad, and in 1881 he returned to bridge building, with the same com- 
pany. He followed that pursuit for two years and then entering into part- 
nership with his brother opened a hotel. In 1889 he came to Nelson and 
entered into the hotel business here, erecting a new building for that purpose 
in 1890. His hotel is one hundred and twenty by sixty feet and contains 
thirty-five rooms. It is conducted in harmony with modern ideas of hotel 
keeping and has become popular with the traveling public, having a liberal 
patronage, which has been secured through the reliable business methods 
of the proprietor and his earnest desire to please his patrons. 

In 1 88 1 Mr. Madden was united in marriag-e to Miss Margaret Fitz- 
patrick and they have seven children, Alan, Sarah, Thomas, Charles, Mary 
and John and James, twins. The family is well known in Nelson and the 
members of the household have a large circle of friends. Mr. Madden 
may truly be called a self-made man, for he started out in life empty-handed 
and has steadily worked his way upward through determination, unfaltering 
energy, executive force and capable business management. 

THOMAS JOHN TRAPP. 

Thomas John Trapp, head of the firm of T. J. Trapp &amp; Company, lim- 
ited, and in numerous other ways one of the foremost business and civic 
factors of New Westminster, has spent thirty odd years in this province and 
is undoubtedly one of the m.ost experienced and tried old-timers of British 
Columbia. It is unfortunate that the limits of this history will not permit 
an extensive recital of the careers of such men as Mr. Trapp, for they have 
seen and passed through the most exciting phases of British Columbia history 
and growth from pioneer times to the present, with stirring and thrilling 
experiences on every hand sufficient to enrich a book of romance. 

Mr. Trapp is a native of Waltham Abby, county of Essex, England, 
born on June 4, 1842, of good English ancestry. His father, Thomas Trapp, 
a native Englishman, was a forest ranger for Sir Heribwald Wake and sur- 
veyor for the town of Waltham Abby, county Essex. He was a Baptist in 
religion and he died in England in his sixty-seventh year. His widow, Eliz- 
abeth (Guy) Trapp, then came out to this province and resided in New 
Westminster until her death, at the age of seventy-seven. 

Reared and educated in his native town Mr. Trapp began his business 
career as a clerk in a grocery store, and later for some time was a traveling 
salesman for a wholesale manufacturing house in Lx)ndon. In 1872 he 
came out to Canada, locating at St. Thomas, Ontario, and as evidence of 
■the fact that he began his business career at the bottom of the ladder it may 



754 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

be stated that he drove spikes and used the pick and shovel as a day laborer 
in the construction of the Canada Southern Railroad. He was also in a 
general store in Buckston, Kent county, Ontario. On the 23d of April, 
1873, he arrived in Victoria, and thence came on to New Westminster. He 
packed his blankets over the trail to Burrard inlet to Hastings sawmill and 
after two weeks spent without employment he got a job at loading a ship 
with spars, being paid three dollars a day and bunking with the sailors. 
After that he packed his blankets back to New Westminster, and from there 
to Victoria. At Spring Ridge he was engaged in digging a ditch and also 
ait cordwood at one dollar and a quarter a cord for dry and one dollar for 
green. While there he walked to Presbyterian church and Sunday school 
every week for a distance of nine miles. He was next employed in A. B. 
Gray's dry goods store at forty dollars a month, his wages soon being in- 
creased to seventy-five dollars a month. In the spring of 1874 he went to 
the Cassiar gold fields, where the excitement had just broken out. The ex- 
pected success did not meet his labors there and he returned and went to 
stock-raising in Nicoli and Kamloops, east of the Cascade mountains. He 
remained there during the winter and then with Rev. S. M. McGregor and 
C. N. McDonald bought four hundred sheep, thus carrying on quite an ex- 
tensive stock business for a time. During this time he was engaged to 
take charge of a pack train with supplies for the surveyors engaged in the 
Rockies, on the Yellow Head Pass for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Arriv- 
ing at the Athabasca depot he found that the surveyors had left for the 
east, letters of instruction being left on eastern slopes. The Athabasca depot 
was established at this point by the Moberly party, this being the old trad- 
ing post of the Hudson's Bay Company. The supplies were stored at this 
depot, and the cattle and horses went on the Bow river, where they wintered. 
At the Hardesty river Mr. H. A. F. McLeod, C. E., was met. he being in 
charge of the eastern division, and made arrangements with Mr. Trapp to 
take charge of the Athabasca depot with the supplies. Mr. Trapp then 
returned with Michael O'Keefe to the Athabasca depot, where they remained 
until the following September, nearly twelve months. The Hudson's Bay 
Company were the first to establish the old Henry House, and here Mr. 
Trapp and Mr. O'Keefe wintered. During the winter the Indians and half 
breeds were out of ammunition and there was imminent danger of starva- 
tion, so Mr. Trapp volunteered to cross the mountains one hundred miles 
to the nearest supply station, the Tete John Cache, and bring back the much 
needed ammunition. He started on January 2, 1876, with two half breeds 
and two dogs, the snow being six feet deep and the cold and hardships of 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 756 

the journey almost exhausted them. When within twenty miles of his des- 
tination the snow was softened by a thaw to such an extent that traveling 
was exceedingly difficult. Forced to camp for the rest of the day and night, 
the two half-breed Indians who accompanied him began praying for colder 
weather and as propitiatory sacrifices to favoring cold weather they fashioned 
out two rabbits from the snow and set them up. Whether these rites had 
anything to do with the weather Mr. Trapp cannot say, but anyhow it was 
colder in the morning and they traveled on top of the snow. Their provi- 
sions for this journey were a little bacon and some tea, and they managed to 
shoot a red squirrel. Their teapot was leaky, the holes being stopped with 
rags, and once or twice, while the pot was setting in the snow to cool a little, 
one of the rags came out and thus their beverage escaped. They finally 
reached Tete John Cache at eight o'clock in the evening, where they got their 
supply of ammunition and waited several days to recuperate. This depot, 
Tete John Cache, was in charge of William Roxburgh and Joe Ratchford. 
After a weary repetition of the journey they arrived at the Athabasca depot. 
Mr. Trapp remained at this post until September, when Marcus Smith, 
C. E., and party came along and with them he returned to Kamloops. 

In the winter of 1879 occurred the Indian outbreak, in which the sher- 
iff, John Usher and a sheep herder by the name of Kelly were killed, John 
McLoud was wounded and the country generally terrorized for some time. 
The red men also came to Mr. Trapp's place, but while they ransacked his 
cabin, taking his firearms, they left him alone, considering him a " good 
fellow." Finally two and a half miles further they killed the above Kelly. 
The Indians were surrounded and captured at Douglas Lake and four of 
them were subsequently hanged, Mr. Trapp being a witness against them. 
During the winter when the trial took place at New Westminster he lost 
most of his stock, owing to the severe winter, and did not return to the 
mountains. He therefore gave up ranching and went into business at New 
Westminster. The firm at first was R. W. Dean &amp; Company, Mr. Trapp and 
his brother Sam both being in the firm. The Trapp brothers later bought 
the business and conducted a general establishment, selling hardware and 
dry goods and doing tailoring and dressmaking. Like most firms this one 
has met with both reverses and successes, but on the whole it has prospered 
exceedingly and has come to be one of the leading houses of its kind in the 
province. The business is now conducted as the T. J. Trapp &amp; Company, 
Limited, with Mr. Trapp as its leading factor. Hardware is now the line 
of trade and they sell it both retail and wholesale. Shelf hardware, stoves, 
furnaces, machinery, both farm and mill, and all other features of an up- 



75t) BRITISH COLUMBIA 

to-clate and metropolitan hardware house will be found. The business passed 
through the great fire of 1898 with heavy loss but it had been established 
on such a substantial basis that it was only a matter of a few months until 
it had recovered its former status and was reaching out for more trade, 
rebuilding and enlarging the premises and building a new block in addition 
to the old one. 

Mr. Trapp is an independent voter and actively interested in the wel- 
fare of his city and province. He is affiliated with the Ancient Order of 
United Workmen, the Woodmen of the World, and for the past sixteen 
years has been an active member of the Royal Agricultural and Industrial 
Society of British Columbia, being president of its board of directors for ten 
years. He was one of the twelve men who built the New Westminster 
Southern Railroad, for which they never received a dollar from the govern- 
ment, and it being the only road in the Dominion not receiving a subsidy, 
and which line is now a part of the Great Northern, Mr. Trapp still is sec- 
retary of this branch. Mr. Trapp has added to his other numerous enter- 
prises the art of the auctioneer and he often conducts sales, being one of the 
most talented and effective men in this business anywhere in the country. 

In 1886 Mr. Trapp was happily married to Miss Nellie K. Dockrill, 
who was born in Canada, being a daughter of Joseph Dockrill. 
Eight children have been born into their home, as follows : Edith Kath- 
leen, Thomas Dockrill, Stanley Valentine, Ethelyn, Neta, George, Donovan 
and Dorothy. They have a delightful home in New Westminster and all 
are highly esteemed in the social circles of the city. Their church mem- 
bership is* with the Presbyterian church. 

RANULPH ROBERT GILPIN. 

Ranulph Robert Gilpin, who is filling the position of collector of customs 
at Grand Forks, having been appointed to this position in 1900, was born 
in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 9th of November, 1861, his parents being 
Edward and Amelia (Haliburton) Gilpin, the mother now deceased, while 
the father is living in Nova Scotia. The son was a public school student 
and mastered the branches taught in the high school at Halifax. Still am- 
bitious for intellectual advancement he then matriculated in the Agricultural 
College in Guelph, where he remained as a student for two years. In 1882 
he arrived in British Columbia and located on a ranch of seventeen hundred 
acres about six and a half miles from Grand Forks, and there he lived for 
twenty years, raising cattle. His was a fine ranch, well improved and highly 
cultivated, and he is quite successful in his business there. He entered the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 757 

public service in 1878 as a preventive officer, and continued in that position 
on the ranch until about five years ago, when the office was removed to 
Grand Forks. In 1900 he was appointed collector of customs and he is 
now acting in that capacity in a very efficient manner, discharging every 
duty that devolves upon him with promptness and fidelity. He is also deputy 
collector of inland revenue. 

In 1894 Mr. Gilpin was united in marriage to Miss Ellen Wyseman, 
a daughter of Joseph Wyseman, of British Columbia, and they have three 
children : Florence Amelia, Bertha May and Arthur Edward. The par- 
ents are identified with the Church of England, and in Grand Forks they 
have many friends who esteem them highly for their sterling worth. 

ERNEST MILLER. 

Ernest Miller, filling the position of city solicitor at Grand Forks, 
was born in New Westminster, British Columbia, November 22, 1870, and 
by reason of his continuous residence in the province he is very familiar with 
its history during the period of its greatest and most permanent develop- 
ment. His parents are Jonathan and Margaret (Springer) Miller, resi- 
dents of Vancouver, in which city the father is filling the position of post- 
master. Under the parental roof Ernest Miller spent the days of his boy- 
hood and youth, his education being acquired in public and private schools 
of his native city and of Victoria. His choice of a profession fell upon the 
law and in order to qualify for the practice he matriculated in the Osgood 
Hall Law School of Toronto, Canada, where he continued his studies until 
1894. In that year he successfully passed final examinations in British 
Columbia, at Victoria. 

Mr. Miller opened an office for practice in Vancouver, where he re- 
mained for two years. In 1894 he removed to Rossland, where he prac- 
ticed for four years, arriving in Grand Forks in 1898. Here he entered 
upon the practice of law and soon secured a good clientage, for he early 
demonstrated his ability to successfully cope with the intricate problems 
of jurisprudence. He has been city solicitor for the past your years. In 
addition to his professional duties he has business interests, having made 
large investments in mining and coal lands, which are rich in products that 
form one of the chief sources of British Columbia's revenue. 

In 1899 occurred the marriage of Ernest Miller and Miss Jean Helen 
Ross, a daughter of Rev. W. R. Ross, late of Manitoba. They have one 
child, Ernest Ross. The parents are communicants of the Church of Eng- 
land and in social circles in Grank Forks they occupy an enviable position. 



758 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Mr, Miller is a Conservative in politics and he belongs to the Knights of 
Pythias fraternity and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He is like- 
wise identified with the British Columbia Law Society and he concentrates 
his efforts upon his professional duties. The zeal with which he has de- 
voted his energies to his profession, the careful regard evinced for the in- 
terests of his clients and an assiduous and unrelaxing attention to all the 
details of his cases have made him a large practice and made him very suc- 
cessful in its conduct. 

NICHOLAS THOMPSON. 

Nicholas Thompson is the founder of the firm of N. Thompson &amp; 
Company, manufacturers of all kinds of machinery and boilers. This is 
one of the leading productive industries of the city, and Mr. Thompson has 
made for himself an honorable place in business circles. He was born in 
Woodhorn, Northumberland, in the north of England, in 1853, and having 
acquired his education in the public schools of his native county, he, in 
1869, was apprenticed to the engineer trade in the works of the celebrated 
engineering and shipbuilding works of Charles Mark Palmer &amp; Company 
at Jarrow on the Tyne. After serving his apprenticeship he went to sea as 
engineer, and succeeded in securing a first class certificate. In 1887 he came 
to Montreal, and after working in the shops of George Brush &amp; Company 
and running as chief engineer on the steamship Cacouna, of the Black 
Diamond line, he started for the west in the fall of 1888. On his arrival 
here Mr. Thompson engaged in steamboating and general business with 
Evans, Coleman &amp; Evans, of this city. In 1899 he launched out for him- 
self with G. H. Hardy, a consulting engineer, under the firm name of Hardy 
&amp; Thompson, and later on they ran under lease what is now the Albion Iron 
Works. In 1902 the firm of N. Thompson &amp; Company was established, his 
associates being William McCullouch, A. Muir and W. V. Radley, who 
joined him in the enterprise and building the factory which covers ten lots 
at No. 136 Alexander street and extending through to Powell street, Van- 
couver. They give employment to more than one hundred operatives, 
manufacturing mill machinery of all kinds, also marine and mining ma- 
chinery, of which they make a specialty, and they are now conducting a 
profitable business, sending their manufactured product throughout British 
Columbia and Alaska. Theirs has become a large and profitable concern, 
and their sales of machinery are now represented by a large figure annually. 
Mr. Thompson has also established the North Pacific Steam Ship Company, 
with head office in Vancouver, and with the assistance of Victoria and Van- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 769 

couver capital, is now constructing the largest freight steamer built in the 
province to the present time, of fourteen hundred tons displacement, cargo 
capacity from eight hundred to one thousand tons, fitted complete with sur- 
face condensing engines, with two Hardy-Thompson patent water-tube 
boilers capable of developing six hundred horse-power, length one hundred 
and eighty feet, forty-six feet beam, fourteen feet depth to hold, the entire 
construction, including machinery and equipments, being made at the N. 
Thompson &amp; Company's works in Vancouver. 

In 1885 Mr. Thompson was married to Katharine, the daughter of 
James White, who for many years was manager of the Springmill Pciper 
Company near Jarrow on the Tyne. Mr. Thompson has been a member 
of the Masonic fraternity for many years, and is past master of Mount 
Hermon Lx)dge, Vancouver, also grand steward in the Grand Lodge of 
British Columbia. 

William McCullouch, who is the manager of the business, was born in 
Scotland, on the 3d of September, i860, and is of Scotch ancestry on both 
sides. He is now the only member of the family in British Columbia. He 
was educated in Scotland and learned the blacksmith and forging trades 
there, and in 1881 came to America, going first to New Jersey, where he 
was employed for some time. He afterward conducted business in Seattle 
for two years, after which he joined Mr. Thompson and the other members 
of the firm in the present enterprise. While in New Jersey Mr. McCullouch 
wedded Miss Margaret Campbell, a native of the north of Scotland and a 
daughter of James Campbell. They have one child, Mary. Mr. McCul- 
louch is a member of the Masonic fraternity, and he was made a Mason in 
Scotland, St. John's lodge. No. 125, A. F. &amp; A. M. The firm of N. Thomp- 
son &amp; Company has made a splendid business record in Vancouver, and the 
partners are gentlemen of marked reliability and enterprise. 

JOHN JOSEPH CAULFIELD. 

John Joseph Caulfield, one of the organizers of the Russell-Law-Caul- 
field Company, Limited, conducting an extensive general mercantile enter- 
prise in Greenwood, was born in Ossawa, Ontario, October 5, i855) his 
parents being William and Ann (Rorick) Caulfield, both of whom are now 
deceased. His education was acquired in the public schools of the city of 
his nativity and throughout almost his entire business career he has been 
identified with merchandising. His first position was in a general mercan- 
tile store in Toronto, and on leaving that place he removed to Winnipeg, 
while in 1882 he became a resident of Brandon, Manitoba, and there em- 



760 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

barked in business on his own account. In 1884 he estabHshed his home in 
Verdon, Manitoba, and opened a general store there, conducting it for five 
years. He then sold out and went into the grain business, in which he con- 
tinued until 1897, when he came to Greenwood and assisted in forming the 
Russell-Law-Caulfield Company, Limited. This firm owns its own build- 
ing, fifty by one hundred feet. It is a two-story structure with basement 
and is entirely occupied by the general mercantile interests of the corpora- 
tion. The store is conducted along modern lines, a well selected stock of 
goods is carried and from the beginning the enterprise has been attended 
with gratifying success. Mr. Caulfield is also one of the stockholders and 
directors of the Providence Mining Company. His business career has 
made him honored and respected by all, for it has been characterized by 
consecutive progress, resulting in success, and at all times his methods have 
been such as would bear the closest investigation and scrutiny. 

In 1883 Mr. Caulfield wedded Miss Margot McArthur, of Colling- 
wood, Ontario. He has served as alderman for several years and has been 
interested in public affairs to the extent of giving hearty co-operation to 
all measures fostering public improvement and general advancement. 

WILLIAM M. LAW. 

William M. Law, who was born in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Sep- 
tember 26, 1863, is a son of William H. and Hetty (West) Law. The 
father is deceased, while the mother resides in Provincetown. The son was 
a student in the public schools and afterward had the advantage of pursuing 
a business course in Poughkeepsie, New York, being thus well qualified 
to enter the fields of commercial activity. He later became bookkeeper 
for a wholesale fruit and produce house in Boston, Massachusetts, where 
he remained for two and a half years, and for one year he was connected 
with the oyster trade in that cit)^ In 1887 he came to Portland, Oregon, 
and was with Tatum &amp; Bowen for eight years, winning advancement with 
that house in recognition of his capable service until he was promoted to 
the position of manager, acting in that capacity for three years. In the 
spring of 1896 he went to Anaconda, where he embarked in general mer- 
chandising as a member of the firm of Miller &amp; Law, but after twenty-one 
months he removed to Greenwood and the firm of William Law &amp; Company 
was thus organized. In 1901 a change occurred in the ownership and the 
present firm of Russell-Law-Caulfield Company, Limited was formed. They 
have developed an extensive business which has become one of the leading 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 761 

commercial concerns of Greenwood, and the house sustains a very enviable 
reputation in trade circles. 

Mr. Law does not confine his efforts entirely to merchandising, but 
with recognition of opportunities in other directions in the northwest he has 
become a stockholder in the Providence Mining Company, and is now its 
secretary and treasurer. In his social relations he is an Odd Fellow, be- 
longing to Boundary Valley lodge, No. 38, I. O. O. F. 

CHARLES WOODWARD. 

Charles Woodward, the founder and proprietor of a large department 
store of Vancouver, and one of its most prominent merchants, has found in 
the expanding business conditions of this city scope for his laudable am- 
bition, perseverance and diligence — ^his dominant qualities. A native of 
Ontario, Mr. Woodward was born in county Wetworth, on the 19th of 
July, 1852, and is of English and Welsh ancestry. His father, John Wood- 
ward, was born in England, on the farm which had been the ancestral home 
of the family for three hundred years and is still in possession of represent- 
atives of the name. He married Miss May Cullham, a lady of Welsh an- 
cestry, and she died in the eighty-second year of her age, while Mr. Wood- 
ward, Sr., is still able to attend to his duties and is now in his eighty-fourth 
year. They were members of the Church of England and people of the 
highest integrity of character. In their family were five children. 

Charles Woodward, the only member of the family in British Colum- 
bia, was educated in his native country, and is a graduate of Mono College, 
was reared upon the home farm until twenty-two years of age and became 
familiar with all the duties and labors that fall to the lot of the agriculturist, 
from the cutting of wood up to the most difficult department of farm work. 
He was a young man of twenty-two when in 1874 he moved with his wife 
and two children to the wilds of Algoma, and with his characteristic energy 
cleared ready for crops the next year over thirty acres, which yielded large 
and profitable returns and commanded ready sale and good prices from the 
incoming settlers. He had taken a farm in the backwoods and had built a 
little store upon it, and this was the humble business beginning of one who 
now ranks with the leading merchants, of Vancouver. He continued in the 
business there for five years, when, selling out, he removed to Manitoba in 
1882, and engaged in the purchase and sale of cattle, thus returning to a 
business with which his early experience had made him somewhat familiar, 
but he soon found that he had made an unprofitable investment and return- 
ing to Algoma, he started anew in business, giving his attention to lumber- 



762 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

ing and merchandising. He soon again built up a large business and met 
with gratifying success, but a disastrous fire occurred and in that way he 
lost heavily. He managed, however, to pay one hundred cents on the 
dollar. The favorable reports concerning British Columbia attracted him, 
and hoping to benefit by the business opportunities which were said to exist 
there, he came to the young city of Vancouver in 1891 and allied his inter- 
ests with her mercantile life. He built a three-story business block, fifty-five 
by seventy feet, at the corner of Harris street and Westminster avenue. 
On the 5th of January he commenced building operations and had the build- 
ing completed on the ist of March following, and was selling groceries, 
boots and shoes, and had rented the parts of the building which he did not 
use. Later, however, his increasing trade demanded the entire building, for 
he met with constantly growing success. In November, 1903, he removed 
to his present building, at the corner of Abbot and Hastings streets. This 
building is sixty-six by one hundred and thirty-two feet, four stories in 
height with basement, Avhich extends under the sidewalk on two sides of 
the building and contains fifty-four thousand feet of selling space. The 
company occupies the whole of this large building, having a well selected 
stock of general merchandise, including everything usually found in such 
an establishment. He has, altogether, fourteen departments, and his is one 
of the fine department stores of the northwest. The building is of brick 
with plate glass front on both sides, and the location is central and very 
attractive. The company is now enjoying a large and profitable business, 
and his mercantile emporium would be a credit to a much older and larger 
city. When the company first began merchandising in Vancouver his store 
was in the edge of the bush, but his faith in the town was unbounded and 
his highest expectations have been realized. He is one of the city's most 
progressive business men, and has, aside from his business, done much to 
promote the welfare and growth of Vancouver. 

In 1873 ^^^- Woodward was married to Miss Elizabeth Anderson, who 
was born in Arthur township, Ontario, a daughter of Donald Anderson, a 
gentleman from Ayrshire, Scotland. Mr. and Mrs. Woodward have nine 
children, of whom six are living, as follows : Mary C, Annie E., Donald 
Anderson, William C, Cora L., and Archie P. 

Mr. Woodward is a member of the Foresters and of Acacia lodge, A. 
F. &amp; A. M., but finds little time for outside interests beyond his store. He 
has done considerable building in the city, thus contributing to its sub- 
stantial upbuilding, but the line of his chief activity has been the develop- 
ment of a mercantile enterprise which has now reached extensive propor- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 763 

tions. Once proprietor of a little country store, he is now at the head of 
a large mercantile emporium, the development of which has made him not 
only a successful one, but also one whose honor and integrity stand as an 
unquestioned fact in his business career. 

WILLIAM FORTUNE. 

William Fortune is the pioneer of Kamloops, and the first cabin which 
graced the present site of that flourishing city was built by him, and "is still 
standing as a landmark of the ancient history of a region which has since 
become one of the most prosperous of British Columbia. Born in England 
in 1838, the son of a thrifty Yorkshire farmer named Richard Fortune, 
he spent the first twenty years of his life in the various occupations incident 
to youth, chief among which was imremitting work on the homestead 
farm, to the cultivation of which he contributed his labors until 1858. At 
that date he took ship for the new world, and on arriving in Buffalo, New 
York, got work at ploughing the streets of the city and planting maple trees 
along the roads. In the following year he went to St. David's, Canada, 
where he spent two years in a tannery business, and then spent a year in 
traveling for the tannery, making Queenstown, Niagara and other points. 
In 1862 he joined a party of twenty-six persons who made an overland 
journey from Queenstown to British Columbia, starting out in March and 
arriving in Kamloops on October 13, 1862. It must be remembered that 
this was a primitive time in the history of the northwest, and the great 
industry of the time was still trapping and fur gathering, agriculture and 
kindred pursuits yet lagging behind the vanguard of civilization. 

During the first winter Mr. Fortune was in the employ of the Hudson's 
Bay Company at a salary of fifteen dollars a month. His efficiency was 
evidently appreciated, for only a short time afterward he was put in charge 
of the teams of the company at a salary of one hundred and thirty dollars 
a month, and during the seven years which he served the company he saved 
up six thousand dollars. This he loaned out on such rates that it brought 
him in an additional income of seventy-five dollars a month. In 1868 he 
built a flour and sawmill at Kamloops, the first built in this part of the coun- 
try, and, the enterprise proving successful, he shortly afterward rebuilt and 
installed improved machinery. Later he put up a still larger sawmill with 
a daily capacity of eighteen thousand feet of lumber, but this was burned, 
and he replaced it and operated the mill for twelve years. In the meantime 
he had taken up one hundred and sixty acres of land in the vicinity, and 
■ he has since kept on buying land until he is now owner of seven hundred 



764 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

acres and has seven thousand acres leased. His stock-raising estabhshment 
is one of the best in the district. He runs about one hundred and fifty head 
of fine horses and some thousand head of Hereford and shorthorn cattle 
on his broad acres. He also maintains a fine orchard of seven acres, in 
which he raises apples, peaches, quinces and other fruits. 

Mr. Fortune has also built a number of stores in Kamloops, and he 
rents these, and he also has mining interests. He is often known as " Cap- 
tain " Fortune from the fact that he built the steamer Lady Dufferin and 
for fourteen years ran this boat on the Thompson river. It was a sixty 
ton boat, ninety-five feet long and sixteen wide. It has been blown up since 
he disposed of it. He holds a captain's certificate as a memorial of his 
career as a steamboat captain. At one time Mr. Fortune owned the electric 
light works at Kamloops. He is a member of the Pioneer Society, and is 
a member and director in the Agricultural Society of New Westminster. 
His wife is Mrs. Jane (Mackaw) Fortune, to whom he was married in 
1869. 

OREGON C. HASTINGS. 

Oregon C. Hastings, of Victoria, now well known in business and 
public life of this city, and also recognized as a scientist of no' mean ability, 
has the honor of having known Victoria from its earliest times to the 
present, although not as a permanent resident through all these years. He 
sailed into the harbor where Victoria now stands as long ago as 1852, being 
on a schooner owned by his father. At that time this was a thickly timbered 
spot, with nothing to indicate a city either potential or actual except the blue 
smoke curling up above the trees from the fort of the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany. Victoria began as a trading post, and its commercial importance has 
continually increased with its expanding population, and Mr. Hastings has 
been an ardent well-wisher of the city from his first connection therewith. 

Mr. Hastings was born in the town of Pontoosuc, Illinois state, April 
26, 1846. On both sides of the family the ancestry is English, and his 
father's family were early settlers of New England. His father, Loren 
Brown Hastings, was born in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, in 18 13, and was a 
man of large capabilities and during his active career had many broad and 
varied experiences, having performed an important part in the history of 
early settlement and material progress in the west and northwest. After 
receiving his education in his native state he taught school for a time. He 
married Miss Lucinda Bingham, a native of New Hampshire, and in 1847 
this couple, with their first born, whom they named Oregon C, crossed the 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 765 

plains in a prairie schooner drawn by oxen and arrived in the new and un- 
developed valleys and woodlands of Oregon. Previous to taking this 
journey the father had been engaged in the manufacture of woolen goods 
in Illinois. He remained for a short time in the then young town of Port- 
land, but when the news came that gold had been discovered in California 
in January, 1848, he at once set out for the scene of excitement. He was 
one of the early arrivals upon the golden ground, and he participated in the 
mining activity for some time. He also kept a store and sold miners" sup- 
plies, hauling his goods from Sacramento and Stockton with oxen. He 
continued these enterprises until 185 1. One day while he was hunting up 
his strayed oxen he came upon an abandoned prospector's hole. Prompted 
perhaps by a motive of idle curiosity, he jumped down and began digging 
out the side of the hole with his rilie. He had hardly crumbled down a 
panful of dirt when there fell out four chunks of gold each weighing from 
sixteen to twenty-two dollars, and before he ceased operations he had taken 
out a thousand dollars' worth of metal, not a piece being worth less than 
live dollars. Mr. O. C. Hastings now has a watch the case of which was 
made from the gold thus taken out by his father on that lucky day. 

Loren B. Hastings, after leaving California, journeyed down the 
Columbia river with his blanket and pack on his back, and then went on to 
Seattle. He was searching for a permanent location, but considered Seattle 
too far away from the ocean, so he decided upon Port Townsend as the best 
place for his future home. When he reached there Plum and Batchelder 
had also just arrived. He at once took up a claim of six hundred and forty 
acres of land, and then went to Portland for his family. There he bought a 
schooner, the Mary Taylor, put on board a large quantity of provisions and 
supplies, and after collecting some twenty settlers sailed for Port Town- 
send. This was the trip in which Mr. Hastings saw the site of Victoria, 
and the boat anchored in the harbor before the fort on February 20, 1852. 
One day later they landed at Port Townsend. The father used his schooner 
in bringing supplies to his store and in taking furs to San Francisco, and 
although he was not a seaman the title of captain was conferred upon him 
and he was so called during the rest of his career. Captain Hastings was 
elected a member of the Washington legislature, and also served as treas- 
urer of Jefferson county, and as a justice. He had a wide and favorable 
acquaintance with all the pioneers of his time, and was a man of distinctive 
individuality and force of character that marked him as a leader wherever 
he went. He was a man of high rnoral and religious beliefs, but was not 
restricted by any definite creed. His death occurred in 1879, when aged 



700 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

sixty-six years, and his wife passed away eleven years later, and they are 
both buried at Port Townsend. They were the parents of two daughters 
and four sons. A part of Port Townsend is built on their original dona- 
tion claim, and the son Francis has his home on the old estate. The son 
Loren is a sea captain and a member of the Washington state legislature. 
Maria married David M. Littlefield, a resident of Port Townsend; Jessie is 
the wife of Captain Crang, of Portland. 

Mr. Hastings spent most of his youth in Port Townsend. He was 
educated in the public schools, and was reared on his father's farm. His 
first teacher was Miss Mary Ann Reed, who was an early resident of Vic- 
toria. His first serious occupation in life was farming, but after he came 
toVictoria he took up the art of photography and for a number of years 
conducted a gallery and did a large business in that line. In January, 1889, 
he sold out his photographic establishment. At the present time he is in 
the service of the United States government as collector of customs during 
the summer at St. Michaels, Alaska. While a resident of the states he was 
a Republican in politics, but in the province is a Conservative. He owns a 
nice home on Douglas street in Victoria, and also has other city property 
and residences. 

Mr. Hastings is an ardent naturalist and astronomer, and has done 
some really valuable as well as interesting work in these lines. He is a 
member of the Natural History Society of British Columbia and of the 
British Astronomical Association. He has the honor of having made for 
his own use the first astronomical telescope made in British Columbia. It 
has a four and a half inch objective, and is six feet focus. It is well mounted 
on an equatorial stand and is mechanically accurate. His little observa- 
tory where he does his work has a revolving dome, and these facilities and 
his theoretical knowledge afford him opportunities for doing much excellent 
work. His studies with the microscope are equally effective, and he is con- 
sidered an authority on these lines of scientific investigation. 

In 1867 Mr. Hastings married Miss Matilda Caroline Burch, of 
Dungeness, Washington. She passed away in 1881, leaving two children: 
Oregon A., who is now in the steamboat service 011 the sound, and Minnie, 
who became the wife of James Caston, collector of customs in San Juan, 
Porto Rico. In 1884 Mr. Hastings married for his present wife Mrs. Sil- 
vestria T. Smith, a daughter of Robert Lazelle. They have one daughter, 
Juanita, who was born in Victoria.

DAVE McBEATH. 

The life history of Dave McBeath is closely identified with the history 
of the Northwest territory, which has been his home for many years. He 
was born in the province of New Brunswick in 1848, and was reared to 
farm life. On reaching young manhood, in 1866, he engaged in work in 
the lumber woods, following that occupation until 1872, when he abandoned 
that business for railroading, engaging first with the Illinois Central. In 
1877 he came west and began work on the Central Pacific Railroad east of 
Winnipeg, and three years later, in 1880, took up his abode in British 
Columbia. From the fall of that year until its completion in 1886 he re- 
mained with the Central Pacific, and in 1886 moved to Washington, where 
for the following three years he was employed on the Seattle, Lake Shore 
and Eastern Railroad. His next connection was with the Great Northern, 
on which he was engaged until its completion, and he then returned to Brit- 
ish Columbia and began work on Crows Nest Pass, there also remaining 
until its completion. Since that time he has worked on the Crows Nest 
Southern from Jennings, Montana, to the Morrisey coal mines, and is now 
engaged in putting in a power plant for the city of Nelson, which will cost 
nearly two hundred thousand dollars. He is emphatically a man of enter- 
prise, and is thoroughly identified in feeling with the growth and prosperity 
of the country which is his home. 

HARVY EXETER BEASLEY. 

Harvy Exeter Beasley, superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Rail- 
way at Vancouver, is a native of Ontario, born in the city of Hamilton, on 
the loth of November, 1862, and is of Englisli" ancestry. His great-grand- 
father, Richard Beasley, was a colonel in command of a regiment in Pennsyl- 
vania at the time of the American Revolution, and being loyal to the king, 
was transferred to Hamilton, becoming one of the first white settlers at the 
head of Lake Ontario. His son, Henry Beasley, was the first white male 
child born in Hamilton. He married and his son, Michael Berkly Beasley, 
was also born in Hamilton. The latter married Miss Julia Newson, who 
was born in Hamilton, and was the daughter of Edward Sparks Exeter 
Newson, an attorney who had emigrated from England to Hamilton at an 
early date. On the maternal side the grandmother belonged to the Sprague 
family and was of German ancestry, the family removing from Wellington, 
Pennsylvania, to Hamilton, Canada. Unto Michael B. Beasley and his 
■wife were born eight children, of whom seven are still living. The father 



768 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

is now retired from active business life and resides in Toronto, Canada, at 
the age of seventy years. Both he and his wife were valued members of 
the Church of England, taking an active part in its work. 

Harvy Exeter Beasley and his brother, M. P. Beasley, are the only 
members of the family in British Columbia. The latter is contracting 
freight agent for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company at Vancouver. 

In the public schools of Hamilton, Canada, Harvy E. Beasley acquired 
his education and throughout his entire business career has been connected 
with the railroad service. He began in the engineering department of the 
Grand Trunk Railway Company, as a clerk, and gradually he won promo- 
tion, remaining with that company until June, 1883, when he removed to 
Manitoba to accept the position of private secretary to the general manager 
of the Manitoba &amp; Northwestern Railroad Company. He was there until 
June, 1884, at which time he received the appointment of secretary to the 
freight auditor of the Northern Pacific Railway Company at St. Paul, Min- 
nesota, but he left there in August, 1885, to accept the position of chief 
clerk for the superintendent of construction of the Lake Superior section of 
the Canadian Pacific Railroad. In 1886 he was transferred to the mountain 
division and continued as chief clerk until 1891, when he won further pro- 
motion, being appointed superintendent of the Kootenay section. He was 
transferred to the president's office in Montreal, in February, 1900, and was 
appointed superintendent at Vancouver, in March, 1901. He has since filled 
this position, and his constant promotions have come in recognition of his 
ability and fidelity. Great are the responsibilities w'hich devolve upon the 
representatives of railroad service, and most careful management of every 
department is demanded. Qualified by experience and native talent, Mr. 
Beasley has from time to time been advanced and is now occupying an im- 
portant position, which ranks him with the leading business men of his city. 

In 1891 Mr. Beasley was united in marriage to Miss K. Griffith, a na- 
tive of the north of Ireland and a daughter of the Rev. David Griffith, a 
Congregational minister. They have four children : Harry, Percy, Ellen 
and Arthur. Mr. and Mrs. Beasley are members of the Church of England 
and he belongs to the Masonic fraternity. They have one of Vancouver's 
attractive residences and its hospitality is greatly enjoyed by a large circle 
of friends. While Mr. Beasley gives the major part of his tim.e to the duties 
of the office, he is also watchful of Vancouver's interests, and is the champion 
of many measures which have had direct bearing upon her progress nn:l 
substantial improvement.

RICHARD MILLS. 



Richard Mills is today the pioneer boot and shoe merchant of Vancou- 
ver, having begun business here in 1887, when the city was in its infancy, 
having hardly emerged from frontier conditions to take its place as a com- 
mercial or business center. In fact, the most farsighted at that time could 
not have dreamed of the future held in store for Vancouver, that its growth 
would be so rapid as to partake of the nature of the marvelous, and that 
within a few years its first temporarily constructed homes should be re- 
placed by fine residences, that substantial business blocks would be built, that 
varied and important manufacturing industrial and commercial interests 
would be established and that all of the advantages, educational, social and 
religious, known to the older east, could be enjoyed here. However, as the 
years have gone by Mr. Mills has felt a just pride in what has been accom- 
plished and has been a co-operant factor in securing this desirable result. 

Mr. Mills was born in Kingston, Ontario, his natal day being Decem- 
ber 6, 1842. Of Irish ancestry, his parents were William and May (Wood- 
ward) Mills, natives of county Donegal, Ireland, where they were reared 
to adult age, the mother being the second daughter of Colonel Woodward 
of county Donegal. With his young wife and their eldest child Mr. Mills 
emigrated to Canada, establishing his home in Kingston, and there he fol- 
lowed the stone mason's trade, becoming a contractor and builder there. 
From Kingston he removed to Goodrich, Huron county, Ontario, and three 
children were added to the family there. In early life he and his wife were 
members of the Church of England, but subsequently belonged to the Meth- 
odist church, and were very active and helpful in its work. He served as 
reeve of the township of Warvanash, was also a member of the school board 
and was active in all the affairs of the township, doing everything in his 
power to advance general gxjod and local progress. He died in 1872 when 
in the sixty-second year of his age, and his wife, surviving him, lived to 
be seventy-five years of age, departing this life in 1894. Two of the family 
are now in British Columbia, Mr. Mills and his brother, Isaac Woodward 
Mills, who is manager of one of the stores owned by our subject. 

To the public school system of Goodrich, Ontario, Mr. Mills is in- 
debted for the educational privileges he enjoyed. He learned the shoe- 
maker's trade in his youth and was engaged in that business at Goodrich 
for four years, after which he removed to Emerson, Manitoba, and was in 
business there for eight years. He then came to the coast for the benefit of 



770 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

his wife's health, which greatly impix)ved here, and since her arrival in 
Vancouver she has never been ill a day. 

Mr. Mills turned his attention to merchandising here, opeing a store in 
1887 as a dealer in boots and shoes. His business has grown constantly and 
rapidly and yet has developed along substantial lines. He now has two 
large stores, one at No. 18 Cordova street, which was his first location, and 
the other at No. 540 Granville street, his brother being in charge of the 
latter. Mr. Mills has met with very satisfactory success. He began busi- 
ness here almost with the beginning of the town and his enterprise has 
grown with the growth of the city. His store on Cordova street is twenty- 
two by one hundred feet and the one on Granville is twenty-four by one 
hundred and twenty-two feet, it being filled with seasonable goods, which 
find a ready sale on the market, owing to the honorable business methods 
and the earnest desire to please that Mr. Mills displays in all his mercantile 
undertakings. 

It was in 1873 that Mr. Mills wedded Miss Margaret Elizabeth Hali- 
day, a native of Perth, Ontario, and they have had six children, four of 
whom are living, as follows : Garnett M., who is now the wife of Thomas 
Mackay, poll tax collector of Vancouver; Maude C, who is acting as her 
father's bookkeeper; Lena W., at home, and William, who is in his father's 
store as a salesman. Mr. and Mrs. Mills are Presbyterians in religious 
faith and he is a prominent Odd Fellow, having passed all the chairs in both 
branches of the order, while of the grand lodge of the province of British 
Columbia he is a past district deputy grand master. They have a nice 
home in Vancouver and the unqualified regard of many of their fellow 
citizens is freely accorded them. Mr. Mills has never had occasion tO' regret 
his determination to seek a home on the Pacific coast for prosperity has 
smiled upon him here. Realizing that labor is kind and that capable man- 
agement and close application form the basic elements of success he has so 
conducted his affairs in harmony with these ethics that today his business 
prominence and success are very gratifying. 

DR. JOHN HERBERT HOGLE. 

Dr. John Herbert Hogle, a capable and rising young physician and sur- 
geon at Nanaimo, has been coming into a constantly increasing share of 
medical and surgical practice in that city and community ever since he 
opened his office some six or seven years ago, and is now among all classes 
esteemed professionally for his proficiency and entire trustworthiness in 
the questions of disease and accident, which are of such insistently vital con- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA . 771 

cern to all people. He has laid the best possible foundation in the way of 
technical and theoretical preparation for a broad career of success, and he 
has already begun to reap the rewards of persevering diligence and stead- 
fast purpose in the pursuit of high ideals. 

Dr. Hogle was born March 29, 1868, in the city of Montreal, where 
his mother, Mary (Constable) Hogle, is still living, but his father, Fred- 
'erick A., is deceased. From a public school education continued through 
the high school, he passed to the pursuance of his professional studies in 
McGill University, one of the best known institutions of medical learning 
on the American continent. On his graduation with the class of 1895 he 
was appointed house surgeon in the Montreal general hospital, and the three 
years spent in that capacity meant a strengthening of all that had gone be- 
fore and a practical experience that was invaluable in his subsequent career. 
He came to Nanaimo in 1898, and soon took and has since retained high 
rank among the practitioners of the city. In addition to his general prac- 
tice he is serving as colliery surgeon. He maintains professional connec- 
tions by membership in the Canadian Medical Association, the British 
Medical Association and the British Columbia Medical Association. 

In January, 1897, D^- Hogle married Miss Ljllian Brunet, whose 
father, Alfred Brunet, of Montreal, is one of the commissioners of the 
Grand Trunk Railroad. Dr. and Mrs. Hogle have four children in their 
home, Margery, Dorothy, Gertrude and Geraldine. 

WILLIAM HENRY SUTHERLAND. 

William Henry Sutherland, M. D., a young and rapidly rising physi- 
cian of Revelstoke, has condensed in his brief period of practice a great 
amount of valuable experience and skillful application, and is already recog- 
nized as one of the reliable and thoroughly equipped practitioners of interior 
British Columbia. 

Dr. Sutherland was born November 19, 1876, on Prince Edward 
Island, where both of his parents, Robert S. and Margaret (Montgomery) 
Sutherland, are still living. From, attendance at the public schools and a 
collegiate career in the Prince of Wales College, Dr. Sutherland passed to 
the study of medicine in the famous McGill University, from which he was 
graduated with the class of 1899 and with the degree of M. D. Fo- ''^-^ 
two following years he added practical to theoretical knowledge by serving 
as house surgeon of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, in which 
position he demonstrated his skill and fitness for a broad professional career. 
After leaving Montreal he made a brief visit at his old home, and 



772 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

in 1902 came to Kamloops, and thence, in February, 1903, located 
at Revelstoke, where he has since been busily engaged in building up a 
representative practice. He is superintendent of Revelstoke Hospital, where 
his surgical skill is especially valuable, and he has membership in the Cana- 
dian Medical Association. 

Dr. Sutherland is a man of broad interests and sympathies, participates 
in business afifairs, and is generally public-spirited and awake to the welfare 
of his community. He is a stockholder in the Pingston Creek Lumber 
Company, and is vice-president of a company which has undertaken to fur- 
nish a water supply to Trout Lake City. Fraternally he is a member of 
Zion lodge. No. 12, A. F. &amp; A. M., at Kensington, Prince Edward Island, 
and also of the Independent Order of Foresters. 

JOSEPH HUNTER. 

Joseph Hunter, vice president, general superintendent and chief en- 
gineer of the Esquimault and Nanaimo Railroad, is a native of Scotland, born 
in Aberdeenshire, on the 7th of May, 1842. His ancestors were numbered 
among both the highland and lowlaad Scotch. 

Educated in the grammar schools and University of Aberdeen under 
Professor James Clark Maxwell, he prepared for his business career by 
studying civil engineering for five years. The year 1864 witnessed his arrival 
in Victoria. Hoping to rapidly realize a fortune in the gold mines, he went 
to the Cariboo district, where, like many others, he was only partially suc- 
cessful. He continued in the mining district, however, until 1871, in which 
year he was elected to represent the district of Cariboo in the first provincial 
parliament that met after the confederation was consummated. He occu- 
pied a seat in the parliament until 1875. 

Mr. Hunter's identification with railroad affairs dates from 1872, in 
which year he joined the engineering staff of the Canadian Pacific Rail- 
road, and from time to time was promoted until he attained the position of 
divisional engineer, and was active in all the operations connected with 
railway survey, location and exploration. In 1876 he was selected engineer 
by the Dominion government to define the international boundary line on 
the Stickeen river between Canada and the United States territory of Alaska. 
The crossing of the river which he located is the line agreed upon as the 
boundary. The question was fully settled upon this basis, and in the settle- 
' ment between the two governments Mr. Hunter's survey was frequently 
referred to and discussed by the eminent counsel on iDoth sides. His reports 
and plans are in the archives of the government at Ottawa, Canada, at Lon- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 773 

(Ion, England, and at Washington, D. C. The year after that survey was 
completed Mr. Hunter explored the Pine river pass through the Rocky moun- 
tains, and his report on that is also in the history of the Pacific Railway. 
From that time until 1883 he was in the service of the Dominion govern- 
ment, making railway locations, and was also selected to write a report on 
the agricultural possibilities of Vancouver island. In 1884 he was appointed 
chief engineer of the Esquimault and Nanaimo Railroad, which he surveyed 
and constructed, and he is still associated with that railway system as its 
general manager and chief engineer, and also as one of the stockholders. 
Another of his important engineering works was the building of a great 
dam of timber at Quesnelle Lake, which has withstood all storms and freshets 
and is a splendid example of his engineering skill. 

His influence and labors have also been an active and beneficial factor 
in forming the laws of his adopted country. He has been a member of the 
House for sixteen years, eight years from the Cariboo district and eight 
years from Comox. He has also served two years as one of the aldermen 
of Victoria, and in all the positions which he has been called upon to fill, 
whether political or in the line of his profession, he has been found an inde- 
fatigable and successful worker. His business career has been marked by a 
steady progression, and in Victoria he has received the recognition which 
is accorded to talent and genuine personal worth everywhere. 

HUGH ST. QUENTIN CAYLEY. 

Hugh St. Ouentin Cayley, a member of the bar of Grand Forks, was 
born in Toronto, Ontario, in 1858, his parents being Hon. William and Emma 
(Boulton) Cayley, both of whom are now deceased. The father was a 
member of an early Canadian ministry and was afterward auditor general. 
Prominent in public affairs, he wielded a wide and beneficial influence, and 
his native talents and acquired ability well fitted him for leadership in mat- 
ters relating to community interests and the national welfare. 

Hugh St. Quentin Cayley was a public school student prior to entering 
Toronto University, in which he completed a full course and was grad- . 
uated with the class of 1881. He, too, became a recognized factor in the 
public life of his locality and was a member of the legislature in Calgary 
for eight years, or from 1885 until 1893. In the latter year he came to 
British Columbia and entered upon the practice of law in Vancouver. Later 
he practiced in Westminster and also at Vernon, and in 1897 he arrived in 
Grand Forks, where he has since been numbered among the representatives 
of the legal fraternity. He is actively connected with a profession which 



774 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

has important bearing upon the progress and stable prosperity of any sec- 
tion or community, and one which has long been considered as conserving 
the public welfare by furthering the ends of justice and maintaining indi- 
vidual rights. His reputation as a lawyer has been won through earnest, 
honest labor, and his standing at the bar is a merited tribute to his ability. 
He now has a very large practice, and his careful preparation of cases is 
supplemented by a power of argument and a forceful presentation of his 
points in the courtroom so that he never fails to impress court or jury, and 
seldom fails to gain the verdict desired. 

In 1897 ^'^^*- Cayley was married to Miss Nora Cochrane, and they have 
one child, Beverly. They are members of the Church of England. 

JAMES RAMSEY. 

James Ramsey, secretary and manager of the Ramsey Brothers Com- 
pany, Limited, manufacturers of biscuit, candies and syrup in Vancouver, was 
born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, his parents being Walter and Sara (Scott) 
Ramsey, who on coming to America brought with them their six children, 
locating at Hyde Park, London, Ontario. The mother died in the fifty-fifth 
year of her age and the father afterward came to British Columbia, spend- 
ing some time in Vancouver. He afterward returned to Scotland, where he 
married again, and he now resides in Columbus, Ohio, at the age of sixty 
years. Throughout his entire life he has devoted his energies to agricul- 
tural pursuits and he has long been a member of the Presbyterian church, in 
which his first wife also held membership. 

James Ramsey was educated in Scotland until his sixteenth year, when 
he crossed the Atlantic to Canada and secured employment in connection 
with the candy business in the service of Robinson Brothers, with whom he 
continued for ten years. Since that time he has been actively engaged in 
his present business, being the secretary and manager of the Ramsey Brothers 
Company, Limited, manufacturers of biscuit, candies and syrup. The presi- 
dent of this company is Dr. G. L. Milne, of Victoria, and the directors are 
_Dr. Milne, William Ramsey, J. B. Harris, William Shane and James Ram- 
sey. The business was first established in Victoria in 189 1 and was con- 
tinued there for six months. They then bought out the British Columbia 
Candy Company in Vancouver and removed to a small place near the gas 
works in Keifer street. Subsequently the business v^'as removed to Hastings 
street, where they remained until they bought out the Imperial Syrup Fac- 
tory and began operations at their present location at No. 998 Powell street, 
where they now occupy a fine building seventy-five by two hundred feet. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 775 

There are four floors in the first building and three floors in the second. 
They have a first-class plant, with abundant steam power, and have a pipe 
line from the ^yrup refinery to the factory. They make the Empire Cream 
soda biscuits, of a superiority which cannot be found anywhere in the prov- 
ince. They have two splendid brands of maple syrup, the Empire maple 
syrup and the Java cane syrup. They manufacture all kinds of confection- 
ery from the cheapest grades to the most fancy and high priced. Their 
chocolate candy is prized throughout the whole province as being without 
a superior. Such has been the good management of the business and the 
rapid growth of the town and the development of the country that the Ram- 
sey Brothers Company, Limited, has met with very gratifying success and 
is now doing a large and lucrative business, employing from seventy-five 
to ninety operatives in their plant. The brothers are William Ramsey, vice- 
president of the company and superintendent of the factory, having in charge 
the manufacturing department; James Ramsey, the secretary and manager; 
George H. Ramsey, who is also a stockholder and is the traveling man of 
the firm, representing the house upon the road, and Miss Mary Ramsey is 
also a stockholder in the company. 

James Ramsey is a member of the Board of Trade of Vancouver and 
the member of the committee of trade and commerce. For eight years he 
was a member of the school board, of which he had served for some time as 
chairman, and he was a member of the local license lx)ard for a year. He 
is now an elder of the First Presbyterian church, very prominent in its work 
and assisting materially in its growth and activities. He is superintendent of 
the Sunday-school and is a co-operant factor in many lines of church work. 
He is also a past grand of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and is a 
past district deputy grand master for British Columbia. He stands to-day as 
one of the most enterprising, active and energetic business men of Van- 
couver. As a business man he has been conspicuous among his associates, 
not only for his success, but for his probity, fairness and honorable methods. 
In everything he has been eminently practical and this has been manifest 
not only in his business undertakings, but also in social and private life. 

ANDREW W. ROSS. 

Andrew W. Ross, a representative business man of Vancouver, who for 
the past ten years has occupied the important position of inspector of the 
board of underwriters, is a native of the province of Quebec, his birth having 
occurred in Ingham, on the loth of June, 1866. He is of Scotch lineage, 
his ancestors in both the paternal and maternal line having emigrated to 



77t&gt; BRITISH COLUMBIA 

Lochaber, in the province of Canada, in the year 1800. James Ross and 
Robert McLachhn were pioneer settlers of that portion of Canada and were 
strict members of the Presbyterian church. Andrew Ross, father of Andrew 
W. Ross, was born in that part of Canada and became a farmer and lumber- 
man. He married Miss Margaret McLachlin, also a native of the same 
neighborhood, and he died when his son, Andrew W., was but two weeks old, 
leaving the widow with two sons, whom she carefully reared. She still sur- 
vives and is now in the seventy-third year of her age, but one of her sons has 
passed away. 

Andrew W. Ross acquired his education in Buckingham and in Ottawa, 
Canada, and in early life became connected with the lumber trade. In the 
year 1888 he made his way to British Columbia, believing that the rapidly 
developing country would offer good business opportunities, such as he 
could not enjoy in the place of his nativity. The McLaren &amp; Ross Lumber 
Company was then formed and at Millside on the Fraser river they built 
the largest sawmill which up to that time had been constructed in the coun- 
try. Later Mr. Ross became connected with the newspaper business, having 
charge of the advertising and subscription department of the Columbia, pub- 
lished at Westminster. The next field of business activity which he entered 
w^as that of insurance, becoming agent for both life and fire insurance com- 
panies. In 1893 he was made inspector of the board of underwriters in 
New Westminster and continued there until after the great conflagration in 
that city, when the two boards of underwriters were united and he removed 
to Vancouver, becoming the inspector of the new board of underwriters, 
which position he has since acceptably filled. He has the oversight of all 
of the fire insurance of the province of British Columbia and in the develop- 
ment and control of the business displays marked executive force and un- 
faltering energy. 

Mr. Ross has always been a Liberal in his political views and has taken 
a very active interest, in the political situation, both in the Dominion and in 
the province. Everything pertaining to his country's welfare and substan- 
tial upbuilding elicits his support and many times receives his hearty co- 
operation. 

On the nth of June, 1890, Mr. Ross was united in marriage to Miss 
Maggie F. Wilson, who was born at Shawville, in the province of Quebec. 
They have five sons and two daughters, all born in British Columbia, namely, 
Lindsay Bouar, Edith, Allen Casper, St. Clair, Vaughn Hall, Beulah and 
Dexwell. The family are of the Protestant faith, attending the services at 
both the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, and the members of the house- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 777 

hold occupy a prominent social position, while in business circles Mr. Ross 
is of that class who promote the general good while advancing individual 
success. 

EDMUND MONTAGU YARWOOD. 

Edmund Montague Yarwood, the well-known barrister at Nanaimo, has 
attained high rank in the legal circles of his district, and during the past 
fifteen years he has built up a notable practice and become known as a relia- 
ble, skillful and exceedingly conscientious attorney. 

Mr. Yarwood was born in Bellville, Ontario, June 13, 1864. His 
father, Claire St. George Yarwood, is now deceased, but his mother, Helen 
(Dougall) Yarwood, a daughter of the eminent Judge Dougall, still lives 
in Bellville. He was educated in the public schools of Bellville, continuing 
through the high school, and his law studies were continued at the famous 
Osgood Hall, which has sent out more finely equipped young aspirants for 
legal honors, many of whom destined to attain great eminence in their 
careers, than any other like institution in Canada. Being thus well fortified 
for the active duties of his profession, Mr. Yarwood, having come out to 
British Columbia in 1889, was in the following year admitted to practice in 
the courts of the province. During the following fifteen years he has been 
located at Nanaimo, being considered one of the most able lawyers of the 
city. He serves in the office of police magistrate for the city, and since tak- 
ing the office on April 4, 1900, has been stipendiary magistrate for the dis- 
trict. 

Mr. Yarwood was married in 1894 to Miss Eda E. Stannard, a daugh- 
ter of J. S. Stannard, of Victoria. Mr. Yarwood affiliates with Black Dia- 
mond Lodge of the Odd Fellows. He is a Conservative in political views, 
and he and his wife are members of the Church of England. 

PETER EDMOND WILSON. 

Peter Edmond Wilson, occupying the position of city solicitor in Nel- 
son, was born near the village of Bond Head, in Simcoe county, Ontario, 
on the 28th of August, 1872, his parents being Charles and Rachel (Doyle) 
Wilson, both of whom are living in Toronto. The father was a farmer by 
occupation and upon the home farm the son spent the days of his boyhood 
and youth, assisting in the labors of the fields through the summer months, 
while during the school session he pursued his education in the public schools 
of the country and afterward entered Brampton high school. He then 
entered the Toronto University and on the completion of a classical course 



778 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

won the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1893. Continuing his studies, the 
degree of Bachelor of Law was conferred upon him in 1895 ^^^ ^^ com- 
pleted his law course in Ontario in 1896. He was admitted to the bar there 
and almost immediately thereafter removed to Nelson, British Columbia, 
entering upon the practice of his profession. After six months he entered 
into partnership with William Galliher, member of parliament. Mr. Wil- 
son is now serving as city solicitor and is a member of the British Columbia 
Law Society. He has a large and growing law practice that has connected 
him with much of the important litigation tried in the courts of the Koote- 
nay district. The favorable judgment which the world passed upon him 
at the outset of his professional career has never been set aside nor in any 
degree modified. It has, on the contrary, been emphasized by his careful 
conduct of* important litigation, his candor and fairness in the presentation 
of cases, his zeal and earnestness as an advocate, and he receives generous 
commendation from his contemporaries. 

In December, 1896, was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Wilson and 
Miss Christine Brown, a daughter of George Brown, of Toronto, and they 
have three living children, John Owen, Patricia Eleanor and Judith Laura. 
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson hold membership in the Church of England, and socially 
he is connected with the Ancient Order of Foresters and with the Fraternal 
Order of Eagles. He enjoys that warm personal regard which arises from 
true nobility of character. 

JOHN J. MALONE. 

John J. Malone, proprietor of the Tremont Hotel in Nelson, is one of 
the pioneer residents of the Kootenay district. When he arrived in this por- 
tion of the province there were no railroads and the work of improvement 
and development seemed scarcely begun. It was necessary to import almost 
everything demanded for daily existence, but the city of Nelson was enter- 
ing upon an era of rapid and substantial upbuilding, and in this work Mr. 
Malone has borne a helpful part, giving hearty co-operation to every meas- 
ure or movement which he has believed would prove of public benefit. 

Mr. Malone was born in Arthur, Wellington county, Ontario, on the 
25th of July, 1862, his parents being James and Annie (O'Mara) Malone, 
who are residents of Toronto. The father was born near the city of Ottawa 
and is now a retired farmer. 

Reared under the parental roof, John J. Malone acquired his early edu- 
cation in the grammar schools of his native town, and experience and ob- 
servation have added largely to his school training, so that he is today a well- 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 779 

informed man. In early life he worked at railroading for a time and in 
1880 he went to Minnesota, where he was engaged in similar work. Going 
next to Dakota and afterward to Montana he still continued in railroad work, 
and in 1882 he went to Seattle, Washington, where he remained until March 
I, 1885. In that year he arrived in British Columbia, establishing his home 
in Victoria. He was in the employ of the Canadian Pacific Railway Com- 
pany until July 15, 1885, when, attracted by the gold discoveries, he engaged 
in placer mining at Similkimeen. He was very successful and remained 
there for five years. In June, 1890, he came to Nelson, British Columbia, 
and has been continuously connected with the city through the era of its 
pioneer development and later progress. There were no railroads here at 
the time of his arrival and it required three weeks for him to make the trip 
on horseback, but the population was rapidly increasing and he understood its 
excellent business conditions. He built the Tremont Hotel, which he has 
conducted continuously since. It was erected in 1891 and on the 3rd of 
June of that year was opened for hotel purposes by Mr. Malone and James 
Clark. The building is ninety by one hundred and twenty feet, two stories 
in height, with basement, and contains fifty-five rooms. The ground floor 
is utilized for the office, dining-room and three store rooms, while the sec- 
ond floor contains the sleeping rooms. The building was erected at a cost 
of twenty-five thousand dollars and the hotel has been capably conducted 
from the beginning, receiving a liberal share of the public patronage. In 
addition to his hotel interests Mr. Malone is now interested in mining, hav- 
ing made judicious investments in property of that character in the Koote- 
nay district. 

In 1897 occurred the marriage of Mr. Malone and Miss Lydia Bennett, 
a resident of Butte county, California, and they have one daughter, Edward 
Marguerite. Mr. Malone belongs to the Knights of Pythias lodge and the 
Fraternal Order of Eagles. He is deeply interested in community affairs 
and served as alderman of the city for two years soon after its incorpora- 
tion. He was also chief of the volunteer fire department for two years, and 
he has put forth activity along many lines for the general good of Nelson 
and the advancement of its prosperity and substantial improvement. 

ALEXANDER McNAIR. 

Alexander McNair, superintendent of the logging department of the 
British Columbia Mills, Timber Trading Company, Vancouver, was bom 
in New Brunswick in i860, and he is a son of John and Lizzie (Kelso) 
McNair, both natives of Scotland. The father came to New Brunswick 



780 . BRITISH COLUMBIA 

when a young man and engaged in the lumber mill business, and was so 
occupied until his death in that locality, which occurred several years ago. 
The mother also died in New Brunswick. 

Our subject was connected in different capacities in the lumber mill 
business, principally with his father, from the age of fourteen years. In 
1885 he came to the Pacific coast, and located at New Westminster, British 
Columbia, where he secured a position in the logging department of the 
Royal City Planing Company, the largest establishment of the kind in the 
province. He was finally made superintendent of the logging department, 
was in charge of all the logging camps of the company, his ability and ex- 
perience making him eminently suitable for such a position. In 1891 he 
removed to Vancouver, which has been his permanent home ever since. 
Recently the Royal City Planing Mills Company was consolidated with the 
Hastings Saw Mill Company, another large and very prominent establish- 
ment, and the consolidated company, in which our subject holds the same 
position as he had heretofore, is known as the British Columbia Mills, Tim- 
ber and Trading Company, owning and operating the following four plants : 
Hastings Saw Mill and the Royal City Planing Mill of Vancouver, the 
Royal City Planing Mill, New Westminster, and the Moodyville Saw Mill, 
Burrard Inlet. These companies comprise the largest lumber manufacturing 
industry in British Columbia, and constnne an immense amount of logs. 
Mr. McNair is a member of the Masonic fraternity, and is widely and very 
popularly known all through this country as "Sandy McNair." He is one 
of the pioneers and has been prominently identified with the lumber inter- 
ests all his life. 

JOHN McLELLAND MACKINNON. 

John McLelland Mackinnon, capitalist, owner of mines and timber 
lands, and one of the leading men of Vancouver, British Columbia, was born 
in the county of Inverness, Hebrides Islands, Scotland, in 1863, and he is 
a son of Charles, who was also born in Scotland, and died there. The Mac- 
kinnons are a historic family in Scotland, the clan being especially distin- 
guished during several centuries for bravery in battle, the family crest bear- 
ing the inscription, '" Fortune Favors the Brave," having been bestowed upon 
them by the rebel king of Scotland several hundred years ago. The earlier 
ancestors of our subject come from the Island of Skye, which is remarkable 
for having furnished more men to fight in wars than any other section of 
similar area in the world. The present chief of the Mackinnon clan is Sir 
William Henry Mackinnon, a genei"al in the British army. 



BRITISH COLUMBIA 781 

Our subject was educated in the public schools and in Watts Institute, 
Edinburgh. While a youth he had decided to see some of the world and 
locate in a country where he might have an opportunity to l&gt;ecome success- 
ful and prosperous. His mind was first turned to India, but he later decided 
to try the States, and arrived in America in 1885. He immediately went 
to Oregon, locating at The Dalles, where he engaged in sheep farming. 
Being a shrewd Scotchman, he soon had a good business, teing very suc- 
cessful from the start, and attained to considerable prominence in local 
business and political affairs. He could not learn to like the States, how- 
ever, the seeming instability of the laws, the trickery in business and the 
" skull duggery " in politics in the west l3eing distasteful to him, for he is 
thoroughly and traditionally a Britisher, and has a great love and venera- 
tion for his native land. Therefore, after six years at Tlie Dalles he came 
to British Columbia and located at Vancouver, which has been his home ever 
since. He has been very successful and has owned and operated numerous 
mines of gold and copper throughout British Columbia and Alaska, and 
dealt extensively in timber lands. He is now one of the very wealthy men 
of this locality, and among other improvements he has made in the city he 
built the Mackinnon Block, a large five-story stone building, one of the 
finest in Vancouver. He also has a fine summer home on Hardy Island, 
off the coast of British Columbia, the island containing seventeen hundred 
acres and is owned by him. In addition he owns two other islands, and is 
an important factor in the commercial life of the city. In politics he is 
a Conservative. He is a life member of the Inverness-Shire Association 
of London, England. 

CHARLES OCTAVE LALONDE. 

Charles Octave Lalonde was born in Vaudreuil, Province of Quebec, 
May 27, 1858, his parents being Joseph and Anne (Daoust) Lalonde. In 
1875 he left his native province and settled in Prince Arthur's Landing, now 
Port Arthur, Ontario. He helped on the survey to locate the present line of 
the Canadian Pacific Railroad west and east of Lake Superior and witnessed 
the turning of the first sod at Town Plot, now Fort William, West Ontario; 
helped to unload from a sailing vessel at the same place the first locomotive 
used on the Canadian Pacific. In 1881, he accepted a clerkship in a gen- 
eral store at Port Arthur, from which position he engaged in the boot and 
shoe business for himself and became a leading citizen as well as a prominent 
merchant of Pbrt Arthur and besides holding other positions of trust, was 



782 BRITISH COLUMBIA 

elected three times a member of the Port Arthur City Council. He sold 
his business there in 1894. 

Mr. Lalonde came to Rossland in October, 1895, and established the 
pioneer boot and shoe store of the place. Boots and shoes were then sold by 
all general merchants, hence in spite of Mr. Lalonde's complete stock, he 
found at first slow sale for his goods. This fact added to his faith in the 
future of Rossland and led him to purchase business property and engage 
in building, the result of which has been most gratifying ; one of the largest 
and finest business blocks in the city is known as the Lalonde and Rodier 
Block. 

In March, 1897, the city was incorporated and Mr. Lalonde and Mr, 
Robert Scott were nominated for first mayor of Rossland. The election 
contest was warm and exciting, the "old timers" were arrayed in support 
of Mr. Lalonde, while the "Johnny-comie-latelies" were enrolled under the 
banner of Mr. Scott. The election was held on April 7, and much to the 
surprise of the "old timers" Mr. Scott was elected. Mr. Lalonde filled the 
following offices in Rossland : Chairman of the Public Schools, 1896 to 
1902; president of the Board of Trade; president of the Rossland School of 
Mines; alderman, 1898-99 and 1900; president of the Liberal Association, 
1 900- 1 901 ; and mayor of Rossland, one term, 1901. 

In 1887, at Port Arthur, occurred the marriage of Mr. Lalonde and Miss 
Alphonsine Saucier, a resident of Matane, . Province of Quebec. They have 
four children : Gaston, Leon, Leonie and Octave. Mr. Lalonde belongs 
to the Roman Catholic churcb and has been active and influential in com- 
munity affairs, his efforts proving of marked value in promoting the sub- 
stantial upbuilding and progress of his adopted city. 

Mr. Lalonde has steadily advanced in those walks of life demanding 
intellectuality, business ability and fidelity, and to-day he commands the re- 
spect and esteem not only of his community, but throughout this portion of 
the province. He has ever been most loyal to the ties of friendship and citizen- 
ship, as well as honorable in business, and his history well deserves a place in 
the annals of British Columbia. 

WILLIAM JAMES ROPER. 

William James Roper, the pioneer ranchman and one of the most suc- 
cessful in that industry in the vicinity of Kamloops, has been located there 
for more than thirty years, and is also one of the early settlers of British 
Columbia. Mr. Roper has wielded a large and beneficent influence in the 
stock industry and the general business activity of the province, and his

enterprise and energetic prosecution of affairs cause him to be regarded as a 
pattern of the successful British Columbia rancher, and he certainly de- 
serves the esteem and reputation for invincible integrity which he has won 
among all his friends and business associates. 

A native of Dorsetshire, England, where he was born May 5, 1842, Mr. 
Roper enjoyed good advantages in his youth, among which was attendance 
at Sherbourne College in England, and in 1862, being then a rugged and 
ambitious young man of twenty years, he left his native land and some weeks 
later, after a journey via the Isthmus of Panama, he arrived in British 
Columbia, which in that year was just beginning its period of development 
and entering upon the career which has since culminated in such a glorious 
meed of prosperity for country and citizens alike. The ship Golden Gate, 
on which he came up the coast to the province, was burned two days after 
his arrival. The first winter was spent at Victoria, and then a short time 
in Laklilash, where he tried, without success, a ranching enterprise. He 
next engaged in packing, teaming and mining in the Cariboo district, and 
continued in that line for about ten years. In 1872 he came to Kamloops, 
and the ranching business which he then started and made a success of 
he has since continued, until he is now mentioned among the foremost men 
of the kind in the district. He owns fifteen thousand acres of land some 
sixteen miles west of Kamloops, and this is in all respects a model ranch. 
He takes much pride in his fine herd of pure-blooded Herefords, and also 
breeds first-class thoroughbred Cleveland Bay and Clydesdale horses. Each 
year about thirty-five hundred head of stock are run on his place. His 
broad acres produce all the hay for feeding the stock, and he also has 
extensive orchards in which are grown quantities of fruit — apples, pears, 
plums and peaches. He is the pioneer of the stock industry in the district, 
and is president of the Pioneer Society. 

■ Mr. Roper was married in 1899 to Miss Grace Marescaux. He has 
fraternal affiliations with Lodge No. 417, A. F. &amp; A. M., of the county cf 
Dorset.
